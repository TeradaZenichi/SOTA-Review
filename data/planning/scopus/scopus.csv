This study evaluates the hourly impact of BEV integration on Italy's energy system using a Python-based simulation model. Two scenarios are analyzed for 2024: (1) 3.5 million BEVs and (2) 7 million BEVs. The model incorporates hourly charging profiles for household and highway fast-charging, Italy's renewable energy mix (solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy), and a 5 GWh battery energy storage system. Results show that Scenario 1 increases daily electricity demand by 19 % (to 1.1 TWh), with peak loads of 47–49 GW, requiring 152 GWh of thermal generation and emitting 76,000 tons of CO<inf>2</inf> daily. Scenario 2 raises demand by 40 % (to 1.25 TWh), with peak loads of 50–53 GW, 224 GWh of thermal generation, and 112,000 tons of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Existing storage mitigates 20 % of peak load but is insufficient for Scenario 2’s 15 GW shortfall. Key demand spikes occur at 01:00 and 11:00–18:00, coinciding with home and highway charging. Policy strategies such as time-of-use tariffs, expanding storage to 15 GWh, and doubling solar capacity could reduce emissions by up to 35 % and supply 80 % of BEV charging needs during daylight hours. This hourly-resolution analysis offers critical insights for grid planning and supports the EU's Fit for 55 targets. © 2025 The Author(s)","Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs); Energy demand; Grid management; Italy; Smart charging; Sustainable transportation","Automotive batteries; Electric energy storage; Fast charging (Batteries); Solar energy; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery electric vehicle; Battery-electric vehicles; Energy demands; Grid management; Grid simulations; Italy; Peak load; Smart charging; Sustainable transportation; Thermal generation; Electric power transmission networks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016788465"

Meanwhile, existing solution methods are inadequate for meeting the multi-objective optimization needs of distribution networks. This study establishes a bi-level collaborative optimization strategy for improving power quality in distribution networks. Specifically, the upper planning tier aims to minimize comprehensive costs through multi-component collaborative planning. The lower operational tier, based on the comprehensive performance evaluation decision model (CPEDM), conducts coordinated scheduling of multiple components by considering both economic benefits and power quality indicators. Furthermore, a fuzzy triple black hole multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOFTBH), which boasts high solution quality, uncertainty handling capabilities, and high adaptability, is developed and employed to solve the bi-level collaborative model. The study focuses on the IEEE-33 system as the research subject, leveraging the MOFTBH for analysis. Simulation results indicate that the optimization strategy presented in this study improves economic benefits and power quality by 45.43% and 19.90%, respectively, compared to the case without any optimization. Specifically, indices such as voltage deviation, voltage fluctuation, and harmonic distortion have improved by 39.01%, 127.45% and 113.14%, MOFTBH demonstrates a 30% faster Pareto front convergence rate compared to benchmark algorithms, with a 25% improvement in solution set uniformity. Under equivalent iteration counts, the objective function values show an optimization range of 18.7%–23.4%.

In this context, clustering has emerged as a powerful tool to help understand and categorize the uncertain behavior of EV users and the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) needs. However, previous studies lack empirical European EV charging data and relevance for practical applications.Therefore, to address such issues, this study evaluates different clustering techniques to identify typical EV charging profiles and, mainly, usage flexibility. The defined methodology comprises three major stages: data preprocessing, clustering application, and validation of results. We conduct benchmarking based on EV energy consumption, arrival, and sojourn times, using K-means, Gaussian mixture model, and Hierarchical clustering. This method allows greater applicability to various datasets from different regions, producing more comprehensive profiles that can provide empirical flexibility data in a visual, intuitive, and relevant approach.A use case considering EV charging data from Caltech University and Greece is utilized to test the proposed methods, demonstrating the versatility of our methodology.Specifically, Caltech features highly flexible prolonged charging sessions, while Greece exhibits quick-stay sessions with less flexibility potential. Both contexts offer opportunities to use the available flexibility for coordination with renewable energy sources and help balance the grid. This information unlocks the potential for future studies, enabling distribution system operators and charge point operators to intelligently and successfully integrate EVs into the energy system. © 2025 The Author(s)","Clustering; Electric vehicle supply equipment; Electric vehicles; Power flexibility; Power systems planning","Charging (batteries); Energy utilization; Gaussian distribution; Hierarchical clustering; K-means clustering; Natural resources; Renewable energy; Caltech; Clusterings; Context clustering; Decarbonisation; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle supply equipments; Power flexibility; Power system planning and operation; Power systems planning; Vehicle pose; Electric vehicles","This document is the results of the research project funded by European Union's Horizon Europe R&I programme under grant agreement no. 101056765.

Our approach explicitly models the impact of start/stop cycling on remaining useful lifetime distributions, providing accurate failure risk assessments. By incorporating sensor-informed and decision-dependent degradation models within an operations and maintenance optimization model, our framework effectively balances lifetime utilization, failure risks, and operational efficiency.

This study proposes and comprehensively evaluates three Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) configurations, namely off-grid, off-grid with Vehicle-to-Home (V2H), and on-grid, integrating solar Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbines (WT), Battery Energy Storage (BES), and Electric Vehicles (EVs). It conducts a detailed techno-economic assessment of these configurations using a rule-based energy management strategy designed to identify the most balanced and sustainable design. A novel rule-based Energy Management System (EMS) is developed to enable real-time, degradation-aware dispatch that accounts for EV availability, battery and EV aging, and local renewable variability. The EMS is computationally efficient, transparent, and suitable for embedded control platforms operating in infrastructure-constrained microgrids. Using hourly simulations over a 20-year horizon with realistic solar, wind, residential load, and rural EV mobility datasets, this work assesses each configuration within a unified techno-economic, environmental, and social framework. Key performance indicators include Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), Return on Investment (ROI), lifecycle CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, employment creation, and Human Development Index (HDI) improvement. The off-grid system with V2H integration demonstrates the most balanced performance, achieving a 96.4 % renewable share, Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) of 0.00017, and a 91.2% reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions compared with the diesel baseline. It also reduces NPC to $199,235, shortens payback to 7.12 years, and increases ROI (0.755) and IRR (12.80%). The on-grid configuration achieves a lower LCOE (0.1010 $/kWh) but compromises energy autonomy and environmental performance. Sensitivity analysis identifies battery cost and project lifetime as the dominant influencing factors. Overall, this study provides a scalable and practical blueprint for resilient and inclusive energy access in remote regions, offering valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to integrate transport electrification with decentralized renewable-energy planning. © 2025 The Author.","Degradation-aware dispatch; Lifecycle carbon-neutral energy access; Multi-scenario renewable configuration assessment; Rule-based EMS for remote microgrids; Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) energy sharing","Charging (batteries); Costs; Ecodesign; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Investments; Microgrids; Renewable energy; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Vehicles; Wind turbines; Carbon neutrals; Degradation-aware dispatch; Energy; Energy access; Energy sharings; Lifecycle carbon-neutral energy access; Management systems; Microgrid; Multi scenarios; Multi-scenario renewable configuration assessment; Renewables; Rule based; Rule-based energy management system for remote microgrid; Vehicle-to-home (V2H) energy sharing; Life cycle","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105021808271"

Accurate forecasting of energy demand at EV charging station clusters (EVCSCs) is essential for optimizing smart grid operations, reducing peak load stress, and guiding cost-effective infrastructure deployment. This study presents a unified and scalable hybrid deep learning framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional LSTM and GRU units (BiLSTM/BiGRU), and attention mechanisms to model complex spatiotemporal dynamics in EV charging data. Domain-specific feature engineering, incorporating lag and rolling window statistics, is combined with Keras Tuner-based hyperparameter tuning and Genetic Algorithm-based time-step optimization to enhance the models’ adaptability and performance across diverse urban environments. Unlike conventional univariate methods, our framework supports multivariate forecasting by jointly predicting daily energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) savings, and gasoline displacement. It also includes weekly peak day forecasting, enabling utility operators to anticipate high-load periods and manage demand-side resources more effectively. The models are trained and evaluated on four real-world public datasets (Palo Alto, Boulder, Dundee, Perth) representing varying consumption patterns and feature granularities. The results demonstrate superior accuracy in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2 (up to 0.99), consistently outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. By integrating operational forecasting with environmental impact metrics, this framework provides a scalable and data-driven tool for intelligent EV energy management system (EMS).

However, planning their deployment requires careful evaluation of both economic and environmental trade-offs. This study presents a novel planning framework that jointly minimizes the total cost of ownership (TCO) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by optimizing onboard battery size, charger power, and number of chargers, while incorporating a detailed battery aging model to capture real-world degradation under varying temperatures and charging conditions. A comparative analysis is conducted across four cities-Singapore, Adelaide, Munich, and Calgary-each representing distinct climate profiles, electricity prices, and grid emission intensities. The study also evaluates three widely used lithium-ion battery chemistries: LFP, NMC, and NCA. Results reveal substantial variation in optimal BEB configurations across regions. Colder cities require larger batteries and higher charging power to maintain reliability, resulting in increased costs and emissions, while milder climates with cleaner grids support more cost-effective and sustainable solutions. Critically, the analysis demonstrates that no single configuration performs best across all locations or chemistries-underscoring that one-size-fits-all approaches are unsuitable for BEB planning. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and transit agencies aiming to deploy BEBs effectively under diverse regional conditions. © 2025 The Author(s)","Battery aging; Battery electric buses; Charging infrastructure planning; Greenhouse gas emissions; Multi-objective optimization; Sustainable transport","Battery management systems; Bus transportation; Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Electric power system economics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lithium-ion batteries; Multiobjective optimization; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Battery aging; Battery electric bus; Charging infrastructure planning; Charging infrastructures; Electric bus; Infrastructure planning; Multi-objectives optimization; Power; Sustainable transport; Economic analysis; battery; electric vehicle; energy planning; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; infrastructure planning; optimization; sustainability; technical efficiency; trade-off; urban transport","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105021565527"

As General Motors partners with electric utilities to design and implement these programs, it is important to understand customers’ preferences and motivations for enrollment. A discrete choice experiment was conducted to quantify how customers trade off among program characteristics and incentives when deciding whether to enroll in demand response, managed charging, and fixed schedule programs. The data were used to estimate two hybrid choice models, which outperform a benchmark conditional logit model and systematically account for unobserved preference heterogeneity using discrete–continuous mixtures. The results indicate that monetary incentives and environmental benefits increase the likelihood of choosing a smart charging program. Meanwhile, there is notable preference heterogeneity regarding non-monetary program options and enrollment perks. Latent environmental concern was constructed as a useful dimension for differentiating customers: those with higher environmental concern tend to exhibit higher valuations of reducing emissions and maximizing renewable energy use.

Thus, an improved approach called MCWOA (modified chaotic whale optimization algorithm) is proposed for optimal sizing of HRES by incorporating the Lévy Flight strategy into the chaotic whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The results obtained are compared with other standard optimization algorithms, like WOA, Chaotic WOA (CWOA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which indicate that MCWOA outperforms all the above-mentioned algorithms in terms of Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and reliability index, i.e., Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP).

Recent research has increasingly focused on understanding and mitigating these impacts, through a wide array of analytical, simulation-based, and data-driven methods both with and without the implementation of network management strategies. However, a comprehensive, integrated synthesis of these studies linking technical findings with mitigation strategies and practical implications is still limited. Additionally, there is a lack of a thorough review consolidating the existing research on this subject, which is essential for understanding the scope of prior studies. Motivated by this gap, this review paper provides a critical and consolidated examination of the current literature on the impacts of EV on distribution networks. The paper's objective is to assess the comprehensive effects of EV integration and evaluate mitigation strategies across three core domains: network management, EV and Distributed generation (DG) coordination, and regulated charging solutions. The paper also introduces the role of artificial intelligence in enabling predictive, adaptive, and scalable solutions. It highlights key methodologies, data sources, modeling approaches, and the efficacy of various solutions while identifying prevailing research gaps and future directions, including real-time co-simulation, techno-economic assessments, and hybrid planning frameworks. Key outcomes of this study include a unified framework for understanding EV interactions with the grid and distribution network, a comparative analysis of mitigation approaches, and a set of recommendations for advancing research and deployment strategies. These findings aim to inform stakeholders about the latest advancements and support decision-making. The findings are particularly beneficial for utility providers, network planners, policymakers, charging infrastructure developers, and researchers seeking to develop robust, data-informed strategies for managing EV impacts and guide them in addressing unresolved challenges. © 2025 The Authors","AI for EV charging; Electric vehicles; EV charging; Hosting capacity; Load demand; Network management; Thermal capacity; Voltage stability","Charging (batteries); Decision making; Electric load distribution; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Greenhouse gases; Information management; Power distribution networks; AI for electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging; Hosting capacity; Load demand; Mitigation strategy; Networks management; Power distribution network; Technical challenges; Thermal; Network management; artificial intelligence; electric vehicle; electrical power; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; mitigation","The research presented in the paper was develop within the project \u201CBest4Grid \u2013 Vehicle battery storage for green transport and grid stability in theNordics\u201D, which is part of the Nordic Grand Solutions Programme funded by Nordic Energy Research.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105020661617"

This energy transition requires the reinforcement planning of the electrical infrastructure to ensure the quality of supply for the next years. Distribution operators need efficient planning tools able to evaluate reinforcement actions for each new connection of EVCS in MV distribution networks. This paper presents a Machine Learning (ML) approach for optimal EVCS allocation based on the Mixed Integer Second Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) formulation. First, a formulation for distribution network operational planning based on an MISOCP model is presented. This formulation aims to minimize total investments while considering operational constraints, the branch flow model, passive and active decision variables. Secondly, a large set of expansion scenarios are solved based on a sensitivity analysis and then used as training data for supervised learning models, allowing them to learn the mapping between scenario inputs and optimal investment outcomes. The strength of the trained model is the fast and accurate predictions of optimal reinforcement actions and investments from unseen new EVCS expansion scenarios, opening new opportunities for efficient large-scale EVCS assessments. Results on a 124-bus MV Network show that decision tree-based models can predict reinforcement actions and investments with a deviation of less than 1%. © 2025 The Author(s)","Distribution network planning; Electric vehicle charging station; Mixed-integer second order cone programming; Prediction of investment actions","Charging (batteries); Decision trees; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Expansion; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Optimization; Power distribution planning; Charging station; Distribution networks planning; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Machine learning approaches; Mixed integer; Mixed-integer second order cone programming; Optimal investments; Prediction of investment action; Second-order cone programming; Sensitivity analysis","This publication is part of the I+D+i project ATLAS with reference PID2021-128101OB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.1 3039/501100011033.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105019645854"

The existing planning methods also lack an assessment of hydrogen supply strategies. To address these challenges, this study proposes a bi-level optimization model for HRS planning and operation considering traffic-power coupling. The upper-level model establishes a multi-objective framework based on spatiotemporal hydrogen demand forecasting, aiming to minimize total system cost and power grid voltage fluctuations while maximizing user satisfaction. The lower-level model optimizes operational decisions by minimizing hydrogen total usage costs, explicitly evaluating the economic and environmental impacts of various hydrogen supply sources. Case studies are conducted using the real road network of Kunming city coupled with extended IEEE-118 system. The model is solved using a combination of the NSGA-III and Gurobi.

This requires selecting the most appropriate conductors, transformers, and voltage regulation devices, which becomes a complex combinatorial problem. This paper proposes a bi-period three-phase AC Optimal Power Flow methodology to minimize asset costs while capturing the time-dependent impacts of EVs, PVs, and the locational effects on the transformer's primary voltage. The proposed approach is demonstrated using two realistic residential Australian LV networks: one having a single circuit with 31 houses, and another having multiple circuits with 89 houses. The approach identified optimal designs for both networks that minimize costs addressing the technical challenges. For single-circuit networks, off-load tap changers with thicker conductors is the most cost-effective design for both close and distant locations (relative to the primary substation). However, in multi-circuit networks, particularly in distant locations with significant voltage variations, on-load tap changers with thinner conductors is the most cost-effective design. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual network characteristics to optimally design brand-new LV networks with EVs and PVs. © 2025 The Author(s)","Conductor sizing; Distribution network planning; Electric vehicle; Optimal power flow; Residential photovoltaic system; Tap changer","Cost effectiveness; Electric load flow; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Housing; Location; Optimal systems; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Conductor sizing; Cost effective design; Distribution networks planning; Low-voltage networks; Optimal power flows; Photovoltaic systems; Residential photovoltaic; Residential photovoltaic system; Tap changers; Three phasis; Electric vehicles","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013546302"

In this regard, this paper presents a new comprehensive planning framework that minimizes the load smoothing index (SI). The proposed approach addresses the optimal design and operation of BSS for electric buses (EBs), in particular by determining the optimal location, minimum storage battery capacity, and smart charging schedule. The method is performed in three innovative steps. First, a high-fidelity physics-based simulation is performed that integrates the technical specifications of EBs, stochastic operating schedules, and a physical energy consumption model to generate realistic battery swapping demands for the EB fleet under three distinct battery capacity scenarios (150, 200, and 250 kWh). Second, the optimal number of storage batteries required for uninterrupted service is determined. Third, a hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm is employed to identify the optimal 24-h charging schedule that smoothes the load curve of the entire network. Finally, the technical feasibility of this solution is validated by applying the optimized BSS load to the IEEE 69-nodes standard test system. The results show that the proposed method is very effective at reducing network stress, lowering the SI from a maximum of 1.59 (in the uncoordinated case) to an optimal value of about 1.13.

Our cost-benefit analysis shows that drivers can save between $3000 and $5000 annually in high-electricity price territories, while in low-price territories, savings can reach up to $400. However, if drivers keep their current charging behavior, they can save between $1500 and $3000 annually in high-price territories and around $200 in low-price territories. Beyond financial benefits, optimal strategies reduce emissions by shifting charging sessions to hours with more renewable generation, which reduces CO<inf>2eq</inf> by up to 2 tonnes per vehicle each year on average. These results demonstrate the importance of potential charging behavior and pricing structures to maximize economic benefits.

To address these issues, it is essential to use advanced modeling techniques to represent uncertainties in generation, load, and pricing. This study introduces an enhanced optimization model that leverages the improved salp swarm algorithm (ISSA) for managing electric vehicle (EV) parking, taking into account price volatility within the main grid as part of a Demand Response Program (DRP). The approach incorporates load-shifting strategies to reduce daily operating costs by redistributing various load components between peak and off-peak periods. The ISSA demonstrates exceptional performance, noted for its rapid response times and strong capability to converge on the global optimum. While modeling hydrogen storage systems (HSS), however, several critical constraints are considered, including operational limits of the electrolyzer, the capacity of the fuel cell (FC), and the storage tank's restrictions. To validate the methodology, the model was applied to a test system comprising smart parking, renewable power plants, and thermal generation, all integrated into the proposed framework for addressing upstream grid price uncertainties. Results underscore the effectiveness of the model, showing that implementing the DRP reduces the average cost of smart parking by approximately 4 %, as evidenced by comparative analysis. © 2025","Demand side management; Electric vehicles; Smart parking; Uncertainty modeling","Cost benefit analysis; Demand response; Electric utilities; Fuel tanks; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Operating costs; Parking; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-grid; Coordination energies; Day-ahead; Demand response programs; Demand-side; Renewable energy integrations; Salp swarms; Smart parking; Swarm algorithms; Uncertainty; Uncertainty models; Uncertainty analysis","The Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China ( 23KJD430003 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105019745836"

Demand-side resources, such as flexible loads and electric vehicle (EV) fleets, present cost-effective avenues for balancing supply and demand dynamics. This study proposes a decentralized bi-level optimization framework to enhance the utilization of demand-side flexibility and energy storage systems while ensuring market participant privacy. A Virtual Storage Plant (VSP) model is introduced to coordinate distributed energy storage assets under the supervision of the Transmission System Operator (TSO). The upper-level problem represents the TSO's strategic planning, while the lower-level problem addresses the operation of VSPs, EV parking facilities, and flexible loads. To optimize market interactions and minimize information exchange between the TSO and service providers, an adaptive Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is employed. The proposed framework is validated using a 30-bus power transmission system, solved through the GUROBI solver within the GAMS environment.

The paper presents the innovative use of a recompression supercritical CO₂ (S-CO₂) Brayton cycle with an ejector as a storage system to absorb the fluctuations of renewables and to extend system flexibility. The given optimization framework is capable of figuring out the best location and the right capacity of the microgrids, and, besides, it can perform a 24-h dynamic scheduling of electric vehicle charging rates. The electric vehicle uncertainties, including fleet size, travel distance, and stochastic charging behavior, are explicitly incorporated. Simulations of the IEEE-30 bus system validate the considerable technical and economic advantages. The optimal microgrid deployment leads to a reduction of active power losses of 0.467 MW (3.9 % reduction), and the voltage profiles are also improved, with all buses being within the ±5 % operational range. Coordinating electric vehicle scheduling, through cutting the consumption of electricity from the grid, achieves a reduction of daily operating costs of roughly 13 % which is a significant saving. Moreover, the S-CO₂ storage system allows for a quick response to sudden changes in demand and supply of electricity. Besides that, the decrease in energy losses is consistent with the non-production of ≈3000 tons of CO₂ emissions per year; thus, the proposal can be considered as a sustainable one. Such results show that the combination of microgrids, electric vehicles, and the application of advanced storage can largely accomplish the grid of the future in terms of efficiency, resilience, and environmental benefits. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Microgrid; Optimization of charge speed; Renewable energy sources; Uncertainty","Brayton cycle; Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy management; Fleet operations; Hybrid vehicles; Microgrids; Operating costs; Renewable energy; % reductions; Electric vehicle batteries; Intelligent energy management; Microgrid; Optimisations; Optimization of charge speed; Renewable energy source; Storage systems; Supercritical; Uncertainty; Stochastic systems","Funding text 1: New Engineering Project from Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. E-XTYR20200660).; Funding text 2: Development and application of 5G + V2X module and risk early warning terminal for intelligent transportation (Sichuan Province Science and Technology Plan Project, No.: 2022YFG0095).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018911990"

The goal is to address stability issues in the power system that arise from large-scale EV charging, as well as to overcome the limitations found in existing studies related to the dynamic interplay between the traffic-grid system and uncertainties in user behavior. A dynamic road model that couples time, speed, and flow is initially established, which integrates the road network with the power grid systems. This model ensures the accurate assignment of vehicle origin-destination (OD) pairs and optimizes path planning using an enhanced Dijkstra algorithm. Thereafter, energy consumption per mile is modeled by incorporating factors such as ambient temperature and driving speed. Subsequently, the Huff-Long Short-Term Memory (Huff-LSTM) model is introduced to characterize user behavior in selecting a charging station. This innovative approach combines the LSTM neural network with the Huff model, accommodating multi-dimensional constraints such as charging station availability and queuing time. The comparison of multiple schemes using real charging station data in Shenzhen demonstrates that the coefficient of determination for this decision model is 0.8912. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation, in conjunction with co-simulation using the IEEE 33-node distribution network, demonstrates that the proposed model effectively captures the spatial and temporal divergence characteristics of temperature-sensitive charging behavior under typical scenarios, thereby enhancing the accuracy of EV charging load simulation. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Charging load; Electric vehicles; Huff model; Neural network","Behavioral research; Charging stations; Charging time; Decision making; Decision theory; Distributed computer systems; Electric load management; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Long short-term memory; Monte Carlo methods; Motion planning; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Charging loads; Charging station; Collaborative simulation; Decision modeling; Electric vehicle charging; Huff model; Memory modeling; Neural-networks; Short term memory; User behaviors; Intelligent systems; algorithm; decision analysis; electric vehicle; numerical model; optimization; power plant; simulation; smart grid; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Nos. 52207205, and 52477188].","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105022122672"

Most existing studies rely on small-sample surveys or limited, context-specific pilot observations, overlooking the heterogeneous V2G participation shaped by mobility needs and spatiotemporal variation, which determine when, where, and how much vehicles can exchange energy and how participation scales different across diverse urban contexts. To address this gap, this study develops a data-driven agent-based modeling framework that captures heterogeneous V2G participation in megacities by integrating heterogenous mobility needs—derived from three months of trajectory data on 18,000 private battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in Shanghai—with spatial variation in land use and infrastructure. This combination reflects both seasonal dynamics and citywide heterogeneity. The model simulates daily charging and discharging decisions, with agents maximizing arbitrage profits while maintaining mobility requirements. Results show that V2G integration intensifies BEV–grid interactions at the individual level, increasing charging volumes by up to fivefold and generating average monthly net gains of 230 CNY per user. At the system level, spatiotemporal variations emerge, shaped by electricity pricing, urban–suburban context, and land-use functions. The framework also demonstrates strong adaptability and transferability, supported by submodule replacement analysis and sensitivity analysis across key parameters, providing a policy-oriented tool for anticipating user behavior and system outcomes in megacities as V2G moves beyond pilot testing. These insights support more effective infrastructure planning and regulatory strategies for a smooth and equitable transition toward large-scale V2G adoption. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based model; Battery electric vehicle; Mobility needs; Trajectory data; Vehicle-to-grid","Autonomous agents; Battery management systems; Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Data integration; Economics; Land use; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Agent-based model; Battery-electric vehicles; Data driven; Megacities; Mobility needs; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Spatio-temporal variation; Trajectory data; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle to grids; Sensitivity analysis; battery; electric vehicle; electricity supply; infrastructure planning; sensitivity analysis; smart grid; spatial variation; China; Shanghai","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52272322 and 52202420 ) and National Science Foundation ( 2323732 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017555464"

This study focuses on the problem of vehicle charging dispatch to make a breakthrough, deeply analyzes the effect and efficiency of the clean energy grid, and then proposes a series of targeted measures to effectively improve the operational efficiency and reliability of the energy system. The comprehensive model integrates electric vehicle charging stations, distributed photovoltaic power generation systems, wind farms, and battery energy storage devices and enables the charging process to be accurately controlled with real-time monitoring and intelligent algorithms. In particular, the demand forecasting model based on machine learning effectively solves the dilemma of matching the charging load with a clean energy supply. Experimental data strongly confirms that the optimization strategy has led to a 15% reduction in peak load on the grid, a 23% increase in the proportion of clean energy consumption, and a 10% reduction in total electricity consumption. For policymakers, these achievements can be used as a guide to help formulate energy policies and build a framework for adapting to the development of new energy. For practitioners, they serve as a guide to energy planning, grid dispatch, and technology research and development to improve effectiveness.

To this purpose, the electrification of delivery fleets and the adoption of smart warehouses equipped with Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) represent the main solutions. Current research often treats the logistics and warehouse task scheduling aspects and the energy management of warehouses and charging infrastructres for Electric Vehicles (EVs) as separate challenges, leaving a gap in solutions that capture the interdependence of logistics and energy flows. To fill this gap, the present paper proposes a comprehensive Energy Management System (EMS) that couples logistic task planning with energy optimization through a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The proposed EMS coordinates a warehouse equipped with a Photovoltaic (PV) power plant, a BESS, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)-enabled EVs and a fleet of Automated Forklifts (AFs) minimizing, on the energy side, the electricity costs of the warehouse and, on the logistics side, the penalties related to unexecuted tasks. Dedicated task scheduling constraints are included in the EMS. Three operational scenarios are analyzed: (I) both the BESS and V2G-enabled EVs are in operation, (II) BESS is out of service but EVs still provide V2G support, and (III) BESS is unavailable and EVs cannot operate in V2G mode. The results demonstrate a 75% reduction in operating costs in Scenario I compared to Scenario III, while a 42% reduction in operating costs is observed when compared to Scenario II. Also, self-consumption increases by 15% in Scenario I with respect to Scenario III, while it increases by 6% in Scenario I with respect to Scenario II. The impact of EV arrival time and transportation demand is assessed too, showing how costs are negatively affected when considering longer traveled distances or shifted arrivals. © © 2025.

Mitigating these impacts requires optimal planning that accounts for RES variability and additional EV charging demand. This paper presents a novel approach for the simultaneous optimal allocation and sizing of RES and EV charging stations, along with coordinated management of the charging process. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and supply costs, and EV battery costs. The model incorporates coefficients based on wind speed, solar radiation, and hourly peak demand to manage EV charging during off-peak hours. A hybrid Harris Hawk Optimization–Sine Cosine Algorithm (HHO-SCA) is proposed to develop a meta-heuristic-based RES and EVs charging system. By integrating SCA features into HHO, the algorithm enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities, thereby improving global search efficiency and optimizing energy usage. The performance of HHO-SCA has been validated on benchmark functions. The HHO-SCA is employed to solve the proposed optimization problem across five scenarios. Its effectiveness for simultaneous optimal siting and sizing of RES and EV charging stations is validated on the IEEE 33 and 69 bus system. Results indicate that HHO-SCA outperforms other methods by effectively avoiding local optima and exhibiting superior convergence behavior. © 2025 The Author(s).","Electric vehicle; Microgrid; Optimization; Power quality improvement; Radial distribution system; Renewable energy","Benchmarking; Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Electric losses; Heuristic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Natural resources; Power quality; Renewable energy; Stochastic systems; Wind; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Microgrid; Optimisations; Power quality improvement; Radial distribution systems; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Sine-cosine algorithm; Vehicle energy; Electric vehicles","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105022216305"

The best placement strategy, which minimises energy absorbed from the MV/LV transformer, reduced voltage standard deviation by over 54 % and eliminated reverse power flows. Additionally, the presence of EVCSs enabled a 193.88 % increase in Photovoltaic (PV) generation compared to the reference scenario, while maintaining voltage within operational limits. In scenarios with high load and limited generation, EVCS integration was constrained due to line loading limits. Conversely, in high-generation scenarios, EVCSs successfully reduced RPFs by over 90 % and allowed more local energy consumption. Further simulations demonstrated that even with energy absorption constraints, strategic placement of just 5 EVCSs was sufficient to eliminate RPFs. The study confirms that properly located EVCSs are essential for enhancing grid flexibility and PV self-consumption, enabling higher DRES penetration, and improving overall DN performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of EVCS siting that simultaneously eliminates reverse power flows and enhances PV integration in a real DN case study. © 2025 The Authors.","Distributed energy storage systems; Distributed renewable energy sources; Distribution network; Electric vehicles charging stations; Grid stability; Non-linear AC load flow","Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Data storage equipment; Distributed energy; Electric load distribution; Electric load flow; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Natural resources; Potassium alloys; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-grid; Voltage distribution measurement; Voltage regulators; AC load; Charging station; Distributed energy storage systems; Distributed renewable energy source; Distributed renewables; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Grid stability; Load flow; Non linear; Non-linear AC load flow; Renewable energy source; Iterative methods","This work was funded by the Next Generation EU - Italian NRRP, Mission 4, Component 2, Investment 1.5, call for the creation and strengthening of 'Innovation Ecosystems', building 'Territorial R&D Leaders' (Directorial Decree n. 2021/3277) - project Tech4You - Technologies for climate change adaptation and quality of life improvement, n.

These include additional power losses, excess yield gaps, drops in voltage levels, and reduced operational flexibility. This work propose a complete optimization model that consists of several steps to enhance the performance and resilience of radial distribution systems (RDS) with respect to daily and seasonal variations using the Transit Search Optimization (TSO) algorithm. Such strategies include optimal allocation of RES, placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS), dynamic network reconfiguration, and improved unit commitment strategies to enhance power quality, mitigate losses, and maintain stable voltage levels. A multi-objective function opts to achieve optimal RES hosting capacity together with optimal tie-switch settings across scenario-based summer, winter, spring, and fall shifts. Simulations were done on both a modified IEEE 33-bus system and a practical 51-bus distribution network. A multi-function framework on TSO is employed for optimal dynamic reconfiguration strategy to improve the performance of the distribution network considering the dynamic behavior of power profiles of wind speed and solar irradiation over a 24-hour period with varying seasons. The aim of the proposed methodology is to optimize the system performance throughout the day under hourly changes in loads and weather conditions. Technical and economic benefits for selection of RES and reconfiguration strategy applied to boost system effectiveness and accommodate more customers. The results of this study show that joint placement of RES integrated with seasonal reconfiguration done markedly enhances efficiency, improves voltage and the voltage stability index, increases operational flexibility, and guarantees reliable supply during peak EV charging and periods of low renewable generation. The optimization also demonstrates robustness against generation and demand uncertainties. © 2025 The Authors.","Distribution Network Reconfiguration (DNR); Hosting capacity (HC); Muti-dimension Operation (MDO); Renewable Energy Sources (RES); Transit Search Optimization (TSO)","Charging (batteries); Dynamic models; Electric losses; Electric vehicles; Natural resources; Optimization; Power quality; Renewable energy; Voltage control; Wind; Distribution network reconfiguration; Electric vehicle charging; Hosting capacity; Muti-dimension operation; Renewable energy source; Search optimization; Transit search optimization; Charging stations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105021854140"

Uncoordinated deployment of charging stations (EVCSs) may further deteriorate grid performance. While existing studies have examined EVCS siting or renewable energy integration separately, few provide a holistic framework that simultaneously considers EVCS planning, renewable generation, storage-based energy management, and user behavior under uncertainty. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated planning model that determines the optimal locations and sizes of EVCSs, aiming to minimize energy losses, investment costs, and driver travel costs, while reducing peak demand and maximizing renewable energy utilization. To achieve this, a hybrid Gray Wolf Optimization–Particle Swarm Optimization (GWO–PSO) algorithm is applied for multi-objective optimization, chosen for its effective balance of global exploration and local exploitation. Photovoltaic (PV) systems are incorporated at selected distribution nodes, and energy management strategies (EMSs) are designed to coordinate energy storage system (ESS) operations. Uncertainties in PV generation and EV charging demand are addressed using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The methodology is validated on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system under a 24-hour simulation. Results show that integrating EMS with optimally located EVCSs reduces average energy losses by up to 15 % and lowers peak power demand by 20 %.

Key concerns include voltage deviations and increased active power losses due to the high penetration of EVCSs. This study proposes a comprehensive multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework for the optimal integration of EVCSs and shunt capacitors (SCs) within the DN, while simultaneously considering the dynamics of the transportation network (TN). To ensure an efficient and sustainable charging infrastructure, a Driving Range-based Traffic Flow Capturing (TFC) model is employed to optimize EV traffic flow coverage, accounting for EV battery constraints and strategic station placement. The proposed framework aims to minimize active power loss (APL) and voltage deviation (VD) in the DN while maximizing EV flow in the TN. To solve this complex multi-objective problem, a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (HGCO) is developed by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO). Objective function normalization is applied to balance the conflicting goals between the DN and TN. The proposed framework was tested on a 33-bus DN and a 25-node TN under three different planning approaches: one focusing on the DN, another on the TN, and a third on their integrated operation. In the integrated planning case, the system recorded an APL of 161.3842 kW and captured 39.45% of electric vehicle flow when battery constraints were applied. Upon removing these constraints, performance improved significantly, with the APL decreasing to 148.5903 kW and EV flow capture rising to 50.52%. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HGCO algorithm effectively balances power system reliability and transportation service efficiency. This integrated planning approach highlights the importance of coordinated EVCS and SC placement in realizing a resilient, efficient, and sustainable electric mobility infrastructure. © 2025","Distribution Network; Electric Vehicle Charging Station; Multi-Objective Optimization; Normalization; Traffic Flow Capturing; Transportation Network","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Electric losses; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Global optimization; Motor transportation; Secondary batteries; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Active power loss; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Multi-objectives optimization; Normalisation; Shunt capacitors; Traffic flow; Traffic flow capturing; Transportation network; Multiobjective optimization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017969098"

To address this problem, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic control (FLC) strategy designed to improve transient response and steady-state accuracy without requiring an exact mathematical model. The study begins with the analytical modeling and component sizing of the SEPIC converter to guarantee continuous conduction mode and stable operation. A two-input fuzzy controller, based on voltage error and error rate, is developed and tested in a model-based design environment using MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller keeps the output voltage deviation below 2% during input disturbances and achieves faster settling compared to classical PID control. For real-time validation, the FLC is implemented on an STM32F446RE 32-bit microcontroller. Experimental results confirm that the FLC significantly reduces overshoot and settling time, enhancing dynamic performance under variable operating conditions.

The growing adoption of EVs poses challenges for power grid integration, including peak demand spikes, voltage instability, network congestion, and uncertain charging behaviour. Addressing these issues requires coordinated planning and operation that meet both transportation and distribution network goals. A multi-stage approach effectively handles multiple objectives. This study introduces strategic two-stage planning and operation of SRPLs in a coupled transportation (TN)-distribution network (DN). In the first stage, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the ideal locations and sizes of SRPLs by integrating a novel EV user satisfaction cost index. The objectives in this stage focus on enhancing the operational performance of both the transportation and distribution networks. In the second stage, the identified locations and sizes are used to determine the optimal operation of SRPLs, taking into account seasonal variations in solar generation and load demand. The objectives aim to maximize SRPL operator profit while minimizing EV user payments, additional DN operator costs, and grid emissions. Fuzzy max-min composition is used to determine the optimal solution by simultaneously satisfying all objectives to the highest possible extent. The proposed technique, validated on real (28-node TN, 69-bus DN) and test (35-node TN, 85-bus DN) systems, effectively identifies SRPL locations, ratings, and operation strategies.

The current research mainly focuses on single facility planning or simple optimization models, which are difficult to solve the complex interaction problems between spatiotemporal charging dynamics, user service demands, and grid constraints. To this end, this study proposes an innovative framework for collaborative planning of charging and swapping facilities. Firstly, Monte Carlo simulation of spatiotemporal load distribution is used to coordinate the allocation of charging and swapping facility resources, breaking through the limitations of traditional isolated planning. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed, using a weighted sum strategy to coordinate construction costs, user waiting time, and grid stability indicators, achieving dynamic balance of conflicting objectives. Furthermore, the Improved Hummingbird Algorithm (IAHA) is developed, which integrates chaotic mapping to enhance population diversity, and combines non-uniform mutation to achieve adaptive global local search, effectively solving high-dimensional complex programming problems.

This study introduces an open-source Vehicle Grid Integration (VGI) tool designed to simulate BEV driving and charging behaviors, specifically for the deployment of 58,900 BEVs in the Tokyo Metropolitan area by 2035. Unlike prior studies that focus solely on either Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) services or charging systems, this research simultaneously investigates both G2V and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) services, while optimizing public charging infrastructure. Three charging strategies (slow, medium, and fast) are analyzed, and an IF-THEN rule-based engine is implemented to ensure charging adequacy after V2G discharging operations. The tool uniquely incorporates inter-zonal driver movement across 14 zones—covering approximately 18 million households—whereas existing approaches only a single region. The results indicate that under V2G scenario, an additional 11.54 MW of generation capacity is needed to meet the annual BEV energy demand of 213.8 GWh, with peak demand occurring during daytime hours, highlighting the need for investments in renewable energy. The study also finds that under V2G scenario, the annual energy flow per BEV for G2V and potential V2G operations is 3630 kWh and 3528 kWh, respectively. Furthermore, the research specifies that under V2G scenario, for every 1000 BEVs, optimal charging infrastructure includes 2 fast chargers and 59 medium-speed chargers to ensure accessibility and alleviate range anxiety. These findings provide important insights for the development of BEV infrastructure and energy management strategies. © 2025 The Author(s)","Charging strategy; Synthetic data generation; Vehicle grid integration; Vehicle trip profile","Charging stations; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Fast charging (Batteries); Investments; Vehicle to infrastructure; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Battery-electric vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Charging strategies; Energy; Grid integration; Large-scales; Planning tools; Synthetic data generations; Vehicle grid integration; Vehicle trip profile; Integration; electric vehicle; energy flow; energy management; energy planning; engine; metropolitan area; smart grid; Tokyo","This work was supported by Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), the 3rd period of SIP \u201CSmart energy management system\"", Grant Number JPJ012207 (Funding agency: JST).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011512686"

A hybrid optimization framework is introduced, combining Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming with a reformulated MILP structure to jointly size photovoltaic systems, battery storage, staged network upgrades, and the dynamic participation of electric vehicles as both load and distributed storage. Thousands of EV constraints are consolidated through a polytope-based approach, and reinforcement costs are captured using a piece-wise linear model tailored to feeder capacity increments.

However, the charging demand of electric vehicles brings new challenges to regional power grids, especially those that rely on clean energy, due to its uncertainty and randomness. This study examines the impact of EV charging demand on the control efficiency of clean energy-based regional power grids. Using real grid data and time-series simulation, we develop a dispatch optimization framework incorporating a master-slave game model based on wind power output distribution. We simulate EV charging patterns, renewable fluctuations, and uncertainties in user behavior and station availability. The results show that unmanaged charging increases peak load by up to 20%, while optimized strategies like Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing, Direct Load Control (DLC), and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) reduce the peak-valley gap by 15%, improve renewable energy consumption by 12%, and lower curtailment. These findings offer valuable insights for EV integration and clean energy planning in regional grids. The results show that at a 30% EV penetration rate, the peak charging demand may lead to a 20% increase in the regional grid load, and by optimizing the charging time, the peak-valley load difference can be reduced by 15%. In addition, a reasonable charging strategy can help improve the utilization rate of clean energy, maximize the consumption of wind power and photovoltaic power generation, and reduce dependence on fossil fuel power generation. © The Author(s) 2025.","Clean energy; Electric vehicle charging demand; Load optimization strategy; Regional grid control","Demand response; Electric load dispatching; Electric load distribution; Electric power plant loads; Electric power system control; Energy utilization; Global warming; Power distribution networks; Strategic planning; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging demands; Clean energy; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging demand; Grid control; Load optimization strategy; Optimization strategy; Regional grid control; Regional grids; Regional power grids; Electric power transmission networks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007735815"

These challenges arise primarily due to the intermittent nature of RESs and the unpredictable charging/discharging patterns of PEVs. As power systems transition towards low-carbon and decentralized power networks, achieving efficient and cost-effective OPF solutions has become a critical priority. Standard optimization algorithms like particle swarm optimization, grey wolf optimization suffer from premature convergence, imbalanced exploration-exploitation, and limited solution diversity, resulting in suboptimal OPF solutions. To address these limitations, this study proposed modified grey wolf optimization (MGWO), selected for its minimal control parameters, enhanced exploration-exploitation using greedy selection, and improved convergence through dynamic leader selection. Uncertainty in RESs and PEVs is modelled using Monte Carlo methods with probability density functions (Weibull, lognormal, and normal distributions), enabling realistic and robust OPF solutions. The proposed algorithm is validated on standard and modified IEEE 30 and 57-bus systems. Comparative and statistical analysis, reinforced by one-way ANOVA test, confirms that MGWO significantly reduces operating cost, emissions, and voltage deviation compared to standard grey wolf optimization, multi-verse optimizer, and arithmetic optimization algorithm. The results underscore MGWO’s potential for power system planning, grid stability, and economic dispatch under high-RESs and PEV penetration scenarios. © The Author(s) 2025","emission; grey wolf optimization (GWO); Optimal power flow; plug-in electric vehicles; renewable energy sources; uncertainty modelling","Distribution functions; Maximum likelihood; Normal distribution; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Size distribution; Solar fuels; Weibull distribution; Emission; Gray wolf optimization; Gray wolves; Optimal power flows; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Plug-ins; Power-flow solution; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty models; Plug-in electric vehicles; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; emission; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; probability density function; uncertainty analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005853282"

Most recent works focus on EV load forecasting for future grid planning and do not take into account real-time EV charging identification. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised memory-based transformer (M-TR) model for real-time detection of EV charging events from streaming smart meter data. The proposed method is designed for deployment by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) and can be integrated into smart grid management systems to enhance grid stability and demand response strategies. The M-TR model leverages an encoder-decoder architecture: the encoder captures coarse-scale historical patterns over an extended temporal window, while the decoder focuses on fine-scale details within a local window. A key innovation of this approach is the dual memory comparison mechanism, which enables faster real-time inference by dynamically integrating historical and recent data. Unlike existing methods, the M-TR requires no prior knowledge of EV charging profiles and only uses real power consumption data from non-EV users. The goal of this approach is to automatically identify EV charging events from behind the meter aggregated smart meter data without requiring labeled EV data or additional sensors, thereby enabling real-time monitoring, reducing grid uncertainties, and supporting load balancing strategies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art unsupervised models, the M-TR achieves superior performance with an average F-score of 0.844 and an AUC of 0.910, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the model's efficient execution time of 1.2 s per 1-min data sample highlights its suitability for real-time applications. This work underscores the importance of incorporating global temporal context and dual memory mechanisms in EV charging detection, offering a scalable solution for integrating EVs into the power grid. © 2025 The Authors","Electric vehicle identification; Online anomaly detection; Smart meter data; Transformer","Balancing; Demand response; Distribution transformers; Electric load distribution; Electric power distribution; Electric power measurement; Electric power system planning; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Signal encoding; Vehicle detection; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging patterns; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle identification; Electricity grids; Grid management; Online anomaly detection; Smart meter data; Transformer; Transformer modeling; Vehicle identification; Decoding; demand analysis; detection method; distribution system; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy management; innovation; memory; smart grid","This work was supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS) via RMIT AWS Cloud Supercomputing Hub.

This study formulates the joint siting and sizing of EVCSs and distributed generators (DGs) as a constrained optimization that minimizes real and reactive losses and voltage deviation with integer bus location decisions. A novel version of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm known as GBest–Lévy Adaptive Differential ABC (GLAD-ABC) is introduced, combining global best guidance, differential perturbations, adaptive step sizes, Lévy-flight scouting, and periodic local refinement for finding the global optimum solution and avoiding local optima. The optimizer is coupled with a backward–forward sweep load flow and a EVCS power demand model. Validation on the IEEE-33 and IEEE-69 feeders across multiple scenarios shows that EVCS-only deployment degrades network performance, whereas optimizing EVCS and DG allocation via GLAD-ABC markedly improves voltage profiles and reduces both real and reactive losses. The proposed optimizer shows superior performance compared with other optimization algorithms reported in the literature, delivering consistently lower active losses alongside fast, stable convergence, indicating strong suitability for utility planning in EV-rich grids. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial bee colony; distribution system; EV; EVCSs; optimization; power losses minimization","Ant colony optimization; Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Distributed power generation; Electric generators; Electric load distribution; Electric load loss; Electric losses; Electric vehicles; Global optimization; Integer programming; Load flow optimization; Artificial bee colony; Artificial bees; Charging station; Distributed generators; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; EV Charging; EV charging station; Optimisations; Power loss minimizations; Constrained optimization","The authors extend their appreciation to the Research, Development, and Innovation Authority (RDIA), Saudi Arabia for funding this work through Grant number (13385-Tabuk-2023-UT-R-3-1-SE).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105023687236"

The gaps in literature that this study aims to address are the insufficient evidence of systematic modelling in the country’s electricity transition strategies, outdated targets in existing modelling studies, limited long-term climate ambitions and the under-representation of the impact of vehicle electrification on electricity planning. Hence, a techno-economic optimisation model is developed to explore three long-term (2025–2050) scenarios in the power sector of Mauritius. Scenario A reflects the current policy ambition, aligning with the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets of achieving 60 % of renewable energy in the electricity by 2030. Scenario B models a pathway to achieve net-zero emissions in the power sector by 2050 and scenario C builds on Scenario B by incorporating widespread electrification of the transport sector. The potential of switching heavy fuel oils with alternative liquid fuels is also explored in all scenarios. The modelling is conducted using a mixed-integer linear programming optimisation tool, the DECarbonisation Options Optimisation (DECO2). Results indicate that carbon emissions drop by almost 50 % if coal is replaced with biomass. Furthermore, a 100 % renewable energy grid is achievable with alternative liquid fuels generating around 1200 to 1500 GWh of electricity. In the case of net-zero emissions, 28 % of electricity can still be produced using fuel oils only if negative emission technologies (NETs) are deployed. Additionally, the electrification of transport is found to have significantly affected the electricity generation capacity. While the modelled system can meet a demand from electric vehicles of up to 400 GWh per year by the year 2050, the flexibility of choosing between the technologies reduces and expensive generation options need to be deployed. This electricity system modelling study aims at supporting policy decisions in national electricity grid planning in Mauritius. © 2025 The Authors.","Decarbonisation; Energy planning; Fossil fuel substitution; Long-term energy modelling; Net-zero emissions","Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electrification; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Mixed-integer linear programming; Zero-carbon; Decarbonisation; Energy model; Energy planning; Fossil fuel substitution; Fuel substitution; Long-term energy modeling; Modelling studies; Net-zero emission; Power sector; Zero emission; Integer programming","The authors gratefully acknowledge Chevening Scholarship by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), UK.

Unlike conventional approaches that focus mainly on transmission investment, the proposed method accounts for the aggregated dispatchable capability of VPPs, providing a more accurate representation of distributed resources. The VPP aggregation model is characterized by the inclusion of electric vehicles, which act not only as load-side demand but also as flexible energy storage units through vehicle-to-grid interaction. By coordinating EV charging/discharging with photovoltaics, wind generation, and other distributed resources, the VPP significantly enhances system flexibility and provides essential support for grid operation. The vertex search method is employed to delineate the boundary of the VPP’s dispatchable feasible region, from which an equivalent model is established to capture its charging, discharging, and energy storage characteristics. This model is then integrated into the TNEP framework, which minimizes the comprehensive cost, including annualized line investment and the operational costs of both the VPP and the power grid. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved using the Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm. A case study based on the Garver-6 bus and Garver-18 bus systems demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. The results show that, compared with traditional planning methods, strategically located VPPs can save up to 6.65% in investment costs. This VPP-integrated TNEP scheme enhances system flexibility, improves economic efficiency, and strengthens operational security by smoothing load profiles and optimizing power flows, thereby offering a more reliable and sustainable planning solution. © 2025 by the authors.","feasible region; quantum particle swarm optimization; transmission network expansion planning; virtual power plant","Costs; Economics; Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Investments; Wind power; Charging/discharging; Distributed resources; Feasible regions; Planning method; Planning models; Quanta particle swarm optimizations; Region description; System flexibility; Transmission network expansion planning; Virtual power plants; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","This work was funded by Science and Technique Project Funds of State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power (Contract number: J2024094).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105023207866"

The model uses a multi-zone planning method and healthy-bus strategy to allocate Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs), Photovoltaic Distributed Generation (PVDG) units, and DSTATCOMs. The proposed framework optimally determines the numbers of EVCSs, PVDG units, and DSTATCOMs using Harris Hawk Optimization, considering the maximization of techno-economic benefits while satisfying all the security constraints. Further, to showcase the benefits from the perspective of EV owners, an EV waiting-time evaluation is performed. The simulation results show that integrating EVCSs (with both AC and DC chargers) with solar PVDG units and DSTATCOMs in the existing RDN improves the voltage profile, reduces power losses, and enhances cost-effectiveness compared to the system with only EVCSs. Furthermore, the zonal division ensures that charging infrastructure is distributed across the network increasing accessibility to the EV users. It is also observed that combining AC and DC chargers across the network provides overall benefits in terms of voltage profile, line loss, and waiting time as compared to a system with only AC or DC chargers. The proposed framework improves EV owners’ access and reduces waiting time, while supporting distribution network operators through enhanced grid stability and efficient integration of EV loads, PV generation, and DSTATCOM. © 2025 by the authors.","distribution static compensators; electric vehicle charging station; Harris Hawk optimization; photovoltaic distributed generation; uncertainty","Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Commercial vehicles; Distributed power generation; Electric losses; Electric vehicles; Static synchronous compensators; Zoning; Charging station; DC chargers; Distributed generation units; Distribution static compensator; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Harris hawk optimization; Optimisations; Photovoltaic distributed generations; Uncertainty; Cost effectiveness","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105021647618"

This paper introduces an intelligent path planning system using the Resistive Grid Path Planning Methodology (RGPPM) to optimize distribution based on energy and environmental metrics. The foundational innovation is the integration of electrical-circuit analogies, modeling the distribution network as a resistive grid where optimal routes emerge naturally as current flows, offering a paradigm shift from conventional algorithms. Using a multi-connected grid with georeferenced resistances, RGPPM estimates minimum and maximum paths for various starting points and multi-agent scenarios. We introduce five key performance indicators (KPIs)—Percentage of Distance Savings (PDS), Coefficient of Savings (CS), Coefficient of Global Savings (CGS), Percentage of Load Imbalance (PLI), and Percentage of Deviation with Multi-Agent (PDM)—to evaluate system performance. Simulations for textbook delivery to 129 schools in the Veracruz–Boca del Río area show that RGPPM significantly reduces travel distances. This leads to substantial savings in energy consumption, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and operating costs, particularly with electric vehicles.

This study proposes a defense-planning framework that models how cyber manipulation propagates to physical impacts in a coupled transport–power system. The interaction is modeled as a tri-level defender–attacker–operator problem in which a defender hardens a subset of charging stations, an attacker forges measurements and demand, and an operator redispatches resources to keep the system secure. We solve this problem with a method that embeds corrective operation into the evaluation and uses improved implicit enumeration (IIE) with pruning to identify a small set of high-value stations to protect with far fewer trials than an exhaustive search. On a benchmark feeder coupled to a road network, protecting a few traffic-critical stations restores compliance with voltage limits under tested attack levels while requiring roughly an order of magnitude fewer evaluations than complete enumeration. Sensitivity analysis shows that the loss of reactive power from PV inverters (PV VARs) harms voltage profiles more than an equivalent reduction in distributed storage, indicating that maintaining local reactive capability reduces the number of stations that must be hardened to meet a given voltage target. These results guide utilities and city planners to prioritize protection at traffic-critical EVCSs and co-plan local Volt/VAR capability, achieving code-compliant voltage quality under adversarial conditions with markedly lower planning effort. © 2025 by the authors.","cybersecurity; defense resource; optimized allocation; transport–power networks","Digital storage; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Motor transportation; Network security; Reactive power; Urban planning; Charging station; Cyber security; Defense resource; Defense resource allocations; Electric vehicle charging; Optimized allocation; Power; Power networks; Transport–power network; Voltage quality; Sensitivity analysis","This research was funded by the State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., Ltd.

The issues caused by high and intermittent energy demand of electric vehicle charging plazas can be solved with energy storage systems. This article covers sizing of stationary energy storage systems for electric vehicle charging plazas. Energy storage systems are sized to constrain the highest amount of power that the charging plaza takes from the grid below a particular power limit and restrict the rate of change in the grid power draw below a particular ramp rate limit. This is the first study concerning sizing of energy storage systems to smooth variations in the power that the charging plazas take from the grid. The power limit was altered from 10% to 100% and the ramp rate limit from 1 to 25 %/min in relation to the rated charging power of the charging plaza. This study was based on two years of measurement data compiled from eight direct current fast charging stations located in southern California, USA. The results show that the power and energy capacity requirements for an energy storage system used solely for reducing grid connection power below 50% increase only a little if the same energy storage system is used simultaneously also for reducing the rate of change in the grid power draw to comply with a ramp rate limit of 5 %/min or higher. However, use of the energy storage system for both purposes simultaneously increased the share of total electric vehicle charging energy that ran through the energy storage system increasing the degradation of the energy storage system. © 2025 The Author(s)","Connection power reduction; Electric vehicle charging; Energy storage sizing; Power smoothing; Ramp Rate Limit","Charge storage; Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Investments; Vehicle-to-grid; Connection power reduction; Electric vehicle charging; Energy; Energy storage sizing; Power; Power limit; Power reductions; Power smoothing; Ramp rate limits; Storage systems; Digital storage","K.

Dynamic tariffs formulated at the planning level, based on quantified impacts and EV load profiles, are implemented through load-shifting strategies at the operational level to optimize grid economy, resilience, and user satisfaction. Finally, a case study in a southeastern China coastal township demonstrated the model's superiority. © 2025 The Author(s)","Renewable Energy-Storage Planning; V2G parameters; Vehicle-Grid Interaction","Charge storage; Data storage equipment; Electric power system economics; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-grid; Dynamic marginal costs; Grid interaction; ON dynamics; Planning models; Pricing mechanism; Renewable energy storages; Renewable energy-storage planning; Storage planning; V2G parameter; Vehicle-grid interaction; Costs","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105019937293"

The existing literature has examined the impact of extreme events on power system planning. However, few studies have systematically explored the role of large-scale electric vehicle (EV) fleets toward grid resilience enhancement in EWEs. Therefore, we propose a resilience-oriented power system planning method considering vehicle-to-grid (V2G) coordination, especially amidst blizzard events. A blizzard-induced grid failure model is established for long-term N-K contingency scenario generation, followed by a two-stage generation expansion and line hardening optimization considering both normal and contingency conditions. Three charging modes of EV fleets, i.e., plug and play (PnP), orderly charging (V1G) and V2G, are compared. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, using 2024 data from the Jibei region of northern China and two extreme blizzard scenarios, demonstrate that combining resilience-oriented planning with V2G coordination significantly reduces total system costs by 58.02% compared to the baseline, achieving the lowest total cost of $2.48×103 million. Furthermore, the integrated approach reduces load shedding cost by 87.74% and 77.95% compared to considering only EV coordination or only resilience planning, respectively. These findings highlight the value and novelty of integrating EV flexibility into long-term resilience-oriented power system planning. © 2025 The Authors","Blizzard modeling; Extreme weather events; Power system planning; Power system resilience; Stochastic optimization; Vehicle-to-grid coordination","Electric load shedding; Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Extreme weather; Optimization; Storms; Vehicles; Blizzard modeling; Extreme events; Extreme weather events; Power; Power system resilience; Power systems planning; Stochastic optimizations; System resiliences; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid coordination; Stochastic systems","This work was supported by Smart Grid-National Science and Technology Major Project ( 2024ZD0802900 ).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018215727"

As charging demand increases, intelligent and data-driven approaches are essential to predict and manage future grid impacts. This paper presents a probabilistic and data-driven approach for generating realistic electric vehicle charging profiles, which can be integrated into probabilistic load flow simulations to assess their effect on grid capacity. In contrast to many existing studies that focus on low-voltage grids, this work targets the sub-transmission grid, analyzing the impact of aggregated charging demand. The approach is applied to a Swedish sub-transmission grid using a combination of real-world data: travel statistics, demographic data, charger usage rates, and two empirical home charging datasets, one representing uncoordinated charging, and another incorporating smart charging technologies. The methodology generates synthetic but realistic charging demand profiles, which are coupled to a full-scale grid model to evaluate the system under 100 % fleet electrification. Results show that substantial congestion may emerge in the primary substation transformers, which may, to some extent, be mitigated by adopting planned or intelligent charging strategies. By combining real-world data with a detailed grid model and a probabilistic modeling approach, the study lays a foundation for analyzing grid impacts under high EV penetration and supports the development of flexibility services to inform more proactive grid planning. © 2025 The Authors","Electric vehicles; EV; Grid capacity impact; Grid planning; Probabilistic load flow; Smart charging","Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Electric substations; Electric utilities; Fleet operations; Population statistics; Traffic congestion; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging demands; Data-driven approach; EV; Grid capacity impact; Grid impacts; Grid planning; Probabilistic load flow; Real-world; Smart charging; Transmission grids; Electric vehicles","Financial support of this work by the Swedish Electromobility Centre through the project ACTUAL Grid and Road Simulation for E-mobility is gratefully acknowledged.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017665723"

Therefore, effective interaction between EVs and the grid has become increasingly important, which is influenced by both variable renewable energy (VRE) on the supply side and charging strategies on the demand side. However, the impact of charging strategies on VRE capacity remains unclear. This study projects the charging loads of EVs under varying electrification levels and develops a city-scale power system dispatch optimization model that incorporates charging strategies to assess their technical, economic, and environmental impacts on the power system. Using Beijing as a case study, the results show that electrification levels significantly influence the effectiveness of charging strategies on power system operation and planning. Compared with uncoordinated charging, unidirectional (V1G) and bidirectional (V2G) charging reduce carbon emissions by up to 1 % and 41 % and total system costs by 7 % and 13 %, respectively, under high electrification. They also provide additional system flexibility, enabling a significant increase in the installed capacity of VRE and its share in the power mix, with V2G performing better and further outperforming V1G in grid stability and peak shaving capacity. Therefore, EV charging with V2G should be incorporated into VRE capacity planning to realize its full potential. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Charging strategies; Electric vehicle; Installed capacity; Variable renewable energy","Charging (batteries); Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electrification; Environmental impact; Fleet operations; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Charging strategies; Electric vehicle charging; Environmental and economic impacts; Installed capacity; Power; Rapid growth; Renewable energy capacity; Uncertainty; Urban power systems; Variable renewable energies; Electric vehicles; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electrification; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; heterogeneity; installation; technical efficiency; uncertainty analysis; urban area; Beijing [China]; China","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 72474024, 72074022, 72488101]","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016317132"

To reduce charging emissions, EVs should be charged strategically to consume generated renewable energy electricity. To achieve this goal, a low-carbon demand response model is proposed to stimulate multi-type EV users to consume more low-carbon electricity by guiding users to adjust their charging behaviour temporally and spatially. First, the charging flexibility of EVs is modelled considering different user behaviours and charging modes. To accurately guide the EV demand response, a method is proposed to calculate future carbon emission factors with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Considering the carbon emission factors, charging flexibility is integrated into a model for a low-carbon demand response. This model holistically optimizes fast and slow charging of EVs from the user's perspective. Case studies are carried out using real-world data and future planning results for Changzhou and China. The results indicate that EVs produce 73 % less carbon emissions during driving than traditional gasoline vehicles. Using low-carbon demand response to guide EV charging could reduce carbon emissions by up to 15 % by 2035. © 2025","Carbon emission; Electric vehicle; Low-carbon demand response; Spatial-temporal flexibility","Behavioral research; Carbon; Carbon Economy; Carbon emissions; Charging (batteries); Demand response; Emission control; Low emission; Zero-carbon; Carbon emission factors; Carbon emissions reductions; Case-studies; Electric vehicle charging; Low carbon; Low-carbon demand response; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal flexibility; Electric vehicles; alternative energy; carbon; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electricity generation; power plant; reduction; spatiotemporal analysis; Changzhou; China; Jiangsu","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFE0117600), Tsinghua University-Toyota Research Center (Project No. TT-2024\u201303), and the Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (52130702, 52477103).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009275288"

To address these challenges, a Traffic Flow Capturing model is employed to maximize EV traffic flow and minimize active power loss (APL) and voltage deviation (VD). A novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (HGPC), combining Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Cuckoo Search Optimization (CO), is proposed to solve the multi-objective problem.

In the DN-focused scenario, the objective is to minimize power loss, whereas in the TN-focused scenario, the goal is to maximize EV flow. In the integrated planning case, with battery constraints, the model achieves 155.05 kW APL and 41.54 % EV flow; without constraints, it improves to 148.14 kW APL and 57.52 % EV flow.

Electric vehicles (EVs), as a low-carbon alternative to traditional gas vehicles (GVs), have developed rapidly in recent years, promoting the coupling between the transportation network (TN) and the power distribution network (PDN). However, this deepening will amplify the impact of road disasters on the coupled system and cause more serious economic losses. Therefore, this paper introduces a comprehensive multi-stage tri-level robust planning of coupled transportation and power distribution network (CTPDN) to systemically enhance traffic resilience and reduce carbon emissions, aiming to minimize investment, traffic, carbon emission and power network costs under uncertain road damage conditions and other uncertainties. Firstly, a modified mixed user equilibrium model is proposed to characterize the behavior of EVs and GVs, which incorporates a unique EV path filtering mechanism and traffic resilience-enhancement characteristics. Then, a carbon-oriented optimal traffic-power flow (OTPF) model is developed to characterize the operation of CTPDN, which takes the carbon emission flow (CEF) into consideration, thereby achieving low-carbon objectives and highlighting the environmental benefits of EVs. An effective solution algorithm, BD-C&CG, is designed to solve this tri-level robust CTPDN planning problem. The proposed planning model is demonstrated using a coupled 33-node PDN and firstly a 12-node TN and then a 47-node TN. Numerical results validate its effectiveness. Furthermore, the advantages of the proposed modified mixed UE model are also verified, reducing 5.89 % travel failure rate.

To address these issues, this study proposes an integrated multi-technology charging station model alongside an innovative analytical framework for assessing the comprehensive benefits of charging aggregators. The framework integrated a randomised load forecasting model with a smart charging strategy and was validated using real-world data obtained from 1682 charging stations, comprising 24,798 individual charging piles, in Shenzhen, China. Implementing the proposed charging station model, combined with Shenzhen's time-of-use tariff structure and an >80 % renewable energy penetration rate, reduced levelised cost of energy, carbon emissions and peak load by 0.38 Yuan per kWh. Furthermore, renewable energy contributes to a 44.01 % reduction in carbon emissions in the smart charging system, outperforming the 41.24 % reduction observed in the on-demand charging system. Additionally, smart charging and on-demand charging methods reduce peak loads by 30.03 % and 15.40 %, respectively. It is found that combining energy storage with smart charging effectively mitigates their negative effects on emissions and costs. Energy storage increased annual carbon emissions (from 1.402 Mt. to 1.688 Mt) in an on-demand charging scenario, whereas it decreased them in a smart charging scenario.

In this paper, the economic dispatch strategy of planning and operation is proposed to optimize the economy of DN. To better describe the correlation between EV charging demand and price uncertainty, a data-driven uncertainty set based on adjacent days is incorporated into two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model. The proposed uncertainty set abandons the extreme scenario and is closer to the real-world scenarios. In the planning stage, charging piles are upgraded to devices with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service capability, minimizing the planning cost. In the operational stage, the recourse method is adopted to quantify the worst output scenarios for wind, photovoltaic, and EV charging demands, which are reflected as the operating costs of the DN. The numerical simulations are carried out under the modified IEEE-33 bus system, and the nested column and constraint generation (N-C&CG) algorithm is adopted to solve the TSRO model under data-driven uncertainty sets. The results indicate that our proposed model decreases the total cost by 14% to 32% compared to other uncertainty models, which guarantees the economy of the decisions made by the model. The analysis demonstrates that the model possesses low conservatism while ensuring robustness and economy, and is suitable for long-term planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Data-driven uncertainty set; Distribution network dispatch; Electric vehicles; Two-stage robust optimization","DC distribution systems; Electric load dispatching; Operating costs; Charging demands; Data driven; Data-driven uncertainty set; Distribution network dispatch; Economic Dispatch; Electric vehicle charging; Price uncertainty; Robust optimization; Two-stage robust optimization; Uncertainty; Electric buses","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (under Grant 62473309), and in part by the Shaanxi Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project (under Grant 2024JC-JCQN-68), and in part by the Xi'an Science and Technology Plan Project (under Grant 24GXFW0050) and in part by the Xi \u2019an Key Laboratory (under Grant 24ZDSY0015).; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (under Grant 62473309 ), and in part by the Shaanxi Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project (under Grant 2024JC-JCQN-68 ), and in part by the Xi\u2019an Science and Technology Plan Project (under Grant 24GXFW0050 ) and in part by the Xi \u2019an Key Laboratory (under Grant 24ZDSY0015 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007009271"

This paper proposes a conceptual trigger-based PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Act) framework for the sustainable grid integration of SLBs, enabling adaptive operational control across diverse application scenarios. The framework combines lifecycle KPI monitoring, degradation and performance tracking, and economic feasibility assessment with trigger-driven dispatch logic. Technical, financial, and environmental indicators are systematically integrated into the four PDCA phases, providing a structured basis for adaptive management. To illustrate applicability, indicative KPI calculations are presented for three representative scenarios (HV Backup, RES Smoothing, and Frequency Regulation). These examples demonstrate how the framework supports scenario-based planning, performance evaluation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches, which typically analyse technical or economic aspects in isolation, the proposed framework introduces a modular, multi-model architecture that aligns operational triggers with long-term sustainability goals. By embedding reuse-oriented strategies into an adaptive PDCA cycle, the study offers a clear and practical methodology for maximising SLB value while minimising degradation and environmental impacts. The framework provides a valuable reference framework for structured SLB deployment, supporting more resilient, cost-effective, and low-carbon energy systems. © 2025 by the authors.","electric vehicles; energy systems; grid flexibility; KPI monitoring; PDCA; second-life batteries; sustainability; trigger-based dispatch","Circular economy; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Economic analysis; Electric power system economics; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Electric vehicle batteries; Energy systems; EV battery; Grid flexibility; Grid integration; KPI monitoring; Plan do check acts; Second Life; Second life batteries; Trigger-based dispatch; Sustainable development","This work was supported by projects \u201CIntegrated modeling for robust management of food-energy-water-social-environmental (FEWSE) nexus security and sustainable development\u201D (IIASA-NASU, 22-501 (R-45-T)), \u201CComprehensive analysis of robust preventive and adaptive measures of food, energy, water and social management in the context of systemic risks and consequences of COVID-19\u201D (0122U000552, 2022\u20132026), \u201CDevelopment of the structure and ensuring the functioning of self-sufficient distributed generation\u201D (0125U001572, 2025\u20132026), \u201CImprovement of the hierarchical system of mathematical and software and information tools for researching the development directions of integrated energy systems in the context of the transition to a low-carbon economy\u201D (0122U000236, 2022\u20132026), which are financed by National Academy of Science of Ukraine.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105020251423"

This study addresses this gap by using the EnergyPLAN model with hourly resolution to assess the integration of electric vehicles, smart charging, and vehicle-to-grid services into a high-renewable energy system on Santiago Island, Cabo Verde. The analysis is based on scenario simulations for 2030 and 2050, assessing the impact on system reliability, carbon dioxide emissions, and system costs. Results demonstrate that vehicle-to-grid services can significantly increase the share of renewable energy penetration, with electric vehicles’ batteries providing short-term system balancing and storage services as early as 2030. By 2050, a fully renewable power system with a high share of electric vehicles is technically and economically feasible.

The strategy incorporates a proactive scheduling framework for hydrogen-integrated distribution networks by identifying the regions most impacted by hurricanes, which are among the most frequent natural events. In the first layer, a bi-level feature selection model is developed to identify the region most affected by the hurricane. The model uses statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis, the Pearson correlation coefficient, neighborhood component analysis, and the Relief algorithm. Building upon identification of the impacted regions, the planning of the hydrogen-integrated distribution networks is conducted using a two-stage scenario-based stochastic programming with robust concepts. This framework optimizes the siting and sizing of fuel cell electric vehicle charging stations in the second layer of the proposed strategy. The third layer simultaneously minimizes risk and variance by scheduling various resilience resources. The problem is subject to linearized constraints involving regret, the AC optimal power flow equation, and the operational limits of RRs. In the proposed problem, the resilience of the hydrogen-integrated distribution networks for contingency-based scheduling is ensured by the utilization of the proposed proactive readiness index.

This study addresses these challenges by proposing two distinct optimization algorithms aimed at enhancing microgrid component sizing and EM efficiency. The first approach, a cascaded Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) methodology, operates in two distinct stages. In the first stage, an annual optimization over 8760 h determines the optimal sizes of microgrid components and their energy management strategies, excluding electric vehicle (EV) flexibility to reduce computational complexity. This stage employs a single MILP formulation where both investment and operational decisions are jointly optimized. The second stage conducts a series of 24-h MILP optimizations for each day of the year, incorporating EV flexibility as a decision variable. This structure allows for refined energy management that adapts to daily variations in renewable generation, EV availability, and demand, while preserving the long-term sizing decisions established in the first stage. The second approach, an embedded Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization-MILP (APSO-MILP) algorithm, performs an iterative 24-h optimization across the entire year, inherently integrating EV flexibility into both sizing and operational decisions. In this hybrid framework, APSO is responsible for exploring optimal capacity configurations for the microgrid components, while MILP handles detailed daily energy management for each capacity set. By coupling the global search capability of APSO with the precision of MILP under linear constraints, this approach ensures more adaptive and accurate system sizing. The embedded structure enables the algorithm to continuously update and refine component sizes and operational strategies based on performance feedback, thereby achieving improved cost and emission outcomes over the full operational timeline. Both algorithms seek to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and Life Cycle Emissions (LCE) over the microgrid's operational lifespan. The microgrid under study consists of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, a battery energy storage system (BESS), power converters, and an electric grid connection serving both EV charging stations and university building loads. Additionally, both optimization strategies account for battery degradation and load shedding, incorporating the Value of Lost Load (VoLL) as a constraint. Results indicate that the embedded APSO-MILP algorithm outperforms the cascaded MILP approach, significantly reducing LCOE and LCE–by approximately 194 % and 520 %, respectively—when considering load shedding and EV flexibility. Moreover, the APSO-MILP approach effectively prevents load shedding across all scenarios, whereas the cascaded MILP method experiences occasional shedding under constrained conditions. Both algorithms highlight the seasonal dependency of energy sources, with increased reliance on energy injections from the grid during autumn and winter, underscoring the importance of BESS in maintaining energy balance. This study provides a comparative evaluation of two advanced optimization techniques for microgrid planning, demonstrating the critical role of EV flexibility and integrated optimization in reducing both economic and environmental costs. The findings offer valuable insights for decision-makers seeking to optimize microgrid configurations while ensuring cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and energy reliability. © 2025 The Author(s)","Electric vehicles; Energy management; Load shedding; Microgrid sizing; Multi-objective optimization; Renewable energy integration","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management systems; Integer programming; Investments; Life cycle; Microgrids; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Secondary batteries; Wind turbines; Energy; Integer Linear Programming; Load-shedding; Microgrid; Microgrid sizing; Mixed integer linear; Multi-objectives optimization; Particle swarm; Renewable energy integrations; Swarm optimization; Electric load shedding; algorithm; alternative energy; autumn; battery; complexity; electric vehicle; energy management; energy storage; investment; optimization; smart grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007972110"

This study tackles the critical challenge of aligning investment and planning between these systems, specifically considering the impact of EV charging behaviors. To address this issue, we propose a novel tri-level optimization framework that incorporates a quasi-variational inequality (QVI) model to effectively capture the interactions between user equilibrium (UE) in transportation networks and elastic EV charging demand. The upper level of the model optimizes investments in power systems, including distributed generation and charging infrastructure. The middle level concentrates on expanding road capacity, while the lower level resolves the traffic flow patterns under user equilibrium with elastic charging behaviors (UE-ECB) using the QVI approach. By transforming the tri-level model into a bi-level optimization program with quasi-variational inequality (OP-QVI) formulation, we achieve computational tractability and provide efficient solutions. Results show that the elastic charging demand model outperforms the non-elastic assumption, reducing total costs by 22.2 %, with power system investments down by 19.1 % and transportation system investments down by 39.8 %. These findings demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, avoiding the overestimation of infrastructure needs. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm efficiently solves complex integrated planning problems, ensuring both computational effectiveness and economic viability in system-wide optimization. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Elastic charging behaviors; Electric vehicle; Power and transportation systems; Tri-level optimization framework; User equilibrium","Electric vehicles; Highway traffic control; Motor transportation; Navigation; Rapid transit; Street traffic control; Variational techniques; Charging demands; Elastic charging behavior; Electric vehicle charging; Optimization framework; Power; Power and transportation system; Quasi variational inequalities; Transportation system; Tri-level optimization framework; User equilibrium; Urban transportation; cost analysis; detection method; economic conditions; electric vehicle; strategic approach; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning","This work was supported by Science and Technology Project of State Grid Fujian Electric Power Co., Ltd .

This study assesses the readiness of Chiang Mai, Thailand, for EV deployment by integrating qualita-tive interviews with 10 key organizations and quantitative survey data from 400 participants (200 EV users and 200 potential users). Findings indicate that 82% of respondents identified environmental concerns – particularly reducing PM2.5 air pollution – as their top motivation for EV adoption. This was followed by expectations of long-term cost savings (78%) and confidence in EV performance standards (74%). In contrast, 67% of non-users indicated high upfront costs as the primary barrier, 62% reported inadequate access to charging infrastructure in suburban and rural areas, and 58% exhibited limited awareness of EV incentives and policies. Policy evaluation re-vealed critical gaps in the implementation of Thailand’s “30@30” target, including delays in financial incentives and insufficient regional infrastructure planning. To address these challenges, the study recommends targeted financial support for middle-income households, strategic expansion of charging networks in underserved areas, and increased public-private collaboration. The integration of smart grid technologies and renewable energy sources is also proposed to enhance grid efficiency and reduce long-term operational costs. By linking EV adoption to measurable environmental and economic outcomes, this research provides actionable insights for policymakers and a replicable framework for secondary cities in Thailand and comparable global contexts. © 2025, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Short-duration transformer overloads, often overlooked in conventional hourly or optimization-based planning models, can accelerate asset aging before voltage limits are reached. This study introduces a second-by-second, multi-agent-based simulation (MABS) framework that couples empirically calibrated Distributed Energy Resource (DER) adoption trajectories with real-time-price (RTP)–driven household charging decisions. Using a real 160-household feeder in Denmark (2024–2025), five progressively integrated DER scenarios are evaluated, ranging from EV-only adoption to fully synchronized EV–PV–battery coupling. Results reveal that uncoordinated EV charging under RTP shifts demand to early-morning hours, causing the first transformer overload within four months. PV deployment alone offers limited relief, while adding batteries delays overload onset by 55 days. Only fully coordinated EV–PV–battery adoption postponed the first overload by three months and reduced total overload hours in 2025 by 39%. The core novelty of this work lies in combining empirically grounded adoption behavior, second-level temporal fidelity, and agent-based grid dynamics to expose transient overload mechanisms invisible to coarser models. The framework provides a diagnostic and planning tool for distribution system operators to evaluate tariff designs, bundled incentives, and coordinated DER deployment strategies that enhance transformer longevity and grid resilience in future energy communities. © 2025 by the authors.","Distributed Energy Resources (DERs); electricity price; EV charging; grid overload; multi-agent-based simulation (MABS)","Autonomous agents; Charging (batteries); Distributed energy; Distribution transformers; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Secondary batteries; Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity prices; Energy; Grid overload; Multi agent based simulations; Multi agent-based simulations; Multi-agent-based simulation; Photovoltaics; Multi agent systems","The paper is part of the project \u201Cthe Danish Participation in IEA ES Task 43\u2014Storage for renewables and flexibility through standardized use of building mass\u201D, funded by EUDP (case number: 134232-510227).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105020241217"

Specifically, Stage-1 considers infrastructure sizes; Stage-2 assigns a binary charge–swap decision per turnaround under no-delay policy; Stage-3 schedules power under time-of-use tariffs and outputs a feasible day plan and daily cost. In order to verify the effectiveness of this paper’s algorithm, this paper conducts case studies and algorithm validation on actual flight data.

This paper presents a novel planning framework aimed at the coordinated deployment of distributed generation, electrical loads, and energy storage systems, including both dispatchable and non-dispatchable electric vehicles. A three-dimensional objective system is constructed, incorporating investment cost, reliability metrics, and network loss indicators, forming a comprehensive multi-objective optimization model. To solve this complex planning problem, an improved version of the NSGA-II is employed, integrating hybrid encoding, feasibility constraints, and fuzzy decision-making for enhanced solution quality. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to validate its practicality. Simulation results demonstrate that the framework effectively addresses key challenges in modern distribution networks, including renewable intermittency, dynamic load variation, resource coordination, and computational tractability. It significantly enhances system operational efficiency and electric vehicles charging flexibility under varying conditions. In the IEEE 33-bus test, the coordinated optimization (Scheme 4) reduced the expected load loss from 100 × 10−4 yuan to 51 × 10−4 yuan. Network losses also dropped from 2.7 × 10−4 yuan to 2.5 × 10−4 yuan. The findings highlight the model’s capability to balance economic investment and reliability, offering a robust solution for future intelligent distribution network planning and integrated energy resource management. © 2025 by the authors.","coordinated response; distribution network; energy storage; grid-based distribution network; NSGA-II; optimal scheduling","Data storage equipment; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Dynamic loads; Electric load dispatching; Electric load distribution; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Power distribution networks; Resource allocation; Smart power grids; Coordinated response; Energy; Grid-based; Grid-based distribution network; Improved NSGA-II; Multi objective; Network loss; NSGA-II; Optimal scheduling; Optimisations; Energy storage","This research is funded by the Research and Demonstration of Grid Collaborative and Mutual Aid Operation Technology for Active Distribution Network with Main Distribution Coordination (030900KC23070002).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105019258237"

A total of 85 public EV stations comprising 209 sockets were georeferenced and analyzed. Two novel indices were introduced to assess infrastructure equity: the socket per density index and the socket travel burden index. Results show that while central business districts are over-served, high-density residential areas such as Ain Shams and Dar Al Salam suffer from significant under-provision. Type 2 connectors dominate the network (77.5 %), leading to functional exclusion for users of CHAdeMO, CCS2, and GB/T vehicles.

To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption-average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions. © 2025 The Author(s).

The mixed-integer model co-optimizes siting and operations for interconnected stations while capturing uncertainties in electric vehicle (EV) arrivals, energy prices, electrical load, and degradation cost. A 24-h scenario study on the IEEE 33-bus feeder uses a normalized probability distribution function (NPDF) and retains the 10 most-probable scenarios. Location matters: placing a single station near the source (Bus 1) yields a total network cost $11,886.61, whereas installing at Bus 33 increases the cost to $12,065.92 but raises operator profit from $8111.82 to $8753.89 via fewer discharge cycles. With one station (Bus 2), energy arbitrage injects 7.5 MW and 5.3 MW at peak hours 15–16. Splitting capacity across two stations (Buses 2 and 10) improves service: Station 10 charged 700 batteries and served 222 EVs, while Station 2 exchanged 9.975 MW with the grid. Under uncertainty, purchased power rises modestly; total network cost increases from $11,894.13 to $11,912.09, while profit grows to $8156.62. Sensitivity analyses show that higher initial charged inventory and larger interconnection capacity reduce system cost and increase profit.

In addition, the disorderly charging of EVs will also lead to uneven benefits of charging stations (CSs) operators and high power loss in the distribution network. To solve these problems, we construct a capacity planning model for CSs with the objective of minimizing the total cost of EVs, CS operators and power grid. By solving this model, the capacity planning result of CSs could meet all given constraints even under a disorderly charging strategy. However, disorderly charging will lead to the unbalanced use of CSs, which may further cause the waste of charging resources. Therefore, we propose the fast charging strategy considering the utilization equilibrium of the CSs and slow charging strategy considering the total charging cost of EVs. By collecting travel plans and vehicle status information of EVs in advance, the intelligent transportation system (ITS) will centrally arranges the charging schedule for EVs and sets the time-sharing charging price for all CSs. Finally, compared with the disorderly charging strategy, we verify that the proposed fast charging strategies could improve the total income of CS operators, reduce power loss and balance the average queuing time of each CS and slow charging strategies could flexibly adjust the EVs charging cost and CSs charging income through IEEE 33-bus and road net 63-node coupling system. © 2025","Capacity planning; Charging station; Charging strategy; Electric vehicle","Charging stations; Costs; Electric losses; Electric power system planning; Fast charging (Batteries); Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Capacity planning; Charging facilities; Charging station; Charging strategies; Co-optimization; Electric vehicle charging; Fast charging; High power loss; Multiple attributes; Station operators; Electric vehicles","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52477097), and the GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2024A1515240034).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012976683"

A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated considering the contradicting technical and economic objectives. A posteriori multi-objective artificial hummingbird algorithm (MOAHA) is employed to solve the optimization problem, generating Pareto optimal solutions. Additionally, multi-objective optimization based on ratio analysis technique is utilized to determine the ideal trade-off solution, offering multiple options based on distribution utility preferences concerning the conflicting goals. The suggested methodology is verified on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus DNs. In-depth case studies illustrate the advantages of the proposed methodology, including minimizing energy losses, reducing voltage deviation, and maximizing voltage stability while considering investment and operational costs.

This study addresses this challenge by proposing a novel Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) framework that strategically absorbs local, spatiotemporally variable surplus photovoltaic (PV) power, based on transport-side access to surplus information. Unlike prior studies that passively assume the availability of renewable energy, our approach enables delivery operators to proactively adjust both the timing and location of charging in response to surplus forecasts, thereby optimizing charging behavior accordingly. Our primary innovation is a mixed-integer programming model with an objective function that directly minimizes CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by distinguishing between carbon-intensive grid power and low-carbon surplus PV based on smart metering data. The model optimizes delivery routes and en-route charging schedules by integrating day-ahead forecasts of regional surplus power. Through a data-driven case study in Utsunomiya, Japan, our method demonstrated a 16.6 % average reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from charging compared to conventional depot-only charging strategies. In high-surplus scenarios, reductions exceeded 60 %. Crucially, these reductions were achieved while satisfying delivery time window constraints and maintaining efficient routing in terms of total delivery time and travel distance. Our findings illustrate that commercial EV fleets can be leveraged as mobile assets to support local energy sustainability, providing a viable pathway to simultaneously decarbonize logistics and enhance grid stability. © 2025 The Author(s)","Charge scheduling; Electric freight transport; Electric vehicle routing problem; Low-carbon logistics; Renewable surplus power","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Forecasting; Freight transportation; Integer programming; Logistics; Vehicle routing; Charge scheduling; CO 2 emission; Electric freight transport; Electric vehicle routing problem; Freight transport; Low carbon logistics; Power; Renewable surplus power; Renewables; Vehicle Routing Problems; Solar energy","This work was supported by Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), the 3rd period of SIP \u201CSmart energy management system\u201D Grant Number JPJ012207 (Funding agency: JST ).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010228073"

Daily variation in charging demand can be synchronized with renewable supply and moved out of grid congestion periods using a range of storage and demand shifting technologies. However, seasonal variation in charging demand, which could add to increasingly-electrified building space-heating demand, is potentially much more difficult to resolve. We develop a statistical model of monthly vehicle energy intensity (Wh/km) based on a citizen-science sourced dataset of multi-year charging data from >1000 vehicles. The model depends on electric vehicle model type, heating and cooling degree day, and location, and can be used to predict seasonal variation in vehicle energy intensity in any climate zone given a distribution of vehicle models. We use the model to explore the seasonal variation in electricity demand from future large scale electric vehicle uptake in New Zealand. We find that electricity consumption for vehicle charging can vary seasonally by up to 16% in some regions and increase winter monthly consumption by up to 30%. These results have implications for future electricity infrastructure planning. The major uncertainties in these projections stem from the difficulty in estimating the energy intensity of the electric vehicle models that will make up the future fleet. © 2025","Electric vehicle charging; Energy intensity; Future electricity grid; Hierarchical model; Random effects; Seasonal variation","Charging (batteries); Climate models; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Fleet operations; Random processes; Traffic congestion; Vehicle-to-grid; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity demands; Electricity grids; Energy intensity; Future electricity grid; Hierarchical model; Large-scales; Random effects; Seasonal variation; Vehicle modelling; Hierarchical systems; demand-side management; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy intensity; infrastructure planning; seasonal variation; New Zealand","MJ acknowledges support from the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment via the Endeavour fund ( UOOX2202 ).

Conventional fixed charging stations (FCS) lack flexibility, failing to adapt to the spatiotemporally dynamic and heterogeneous nature of EV charging demand, thereby exacerbating grid resilience risks. To address this, we propose a dual-mode multi-agent mobile robot-based adaptive charging network (MRACN) that enhances power system resilience through real-time, intelligent coordination of mobile charging resources. Our dynamic scheduling strategy enables MRACN units to switch seamlessly between cost-optimized dispatch during normal operations and resilience-driven prioritization during emergencies, guided by a real-time voltage stability index (VSI)-derived resilience coefficient. The framework combines a power-traffic co-simulation environment modelling urban congestion, heterogeneous EV mobility (private, taxi, fleet), and spatiotemporal demand variations, and a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model optimizing energy cost, customer satisfaction, and voltage stability under realistic constraints (traffic delays, mobility restrictions, grid safety margins). Simulations on a coupled IEEE 33-bus distribution system and 32-node transportation network demonstrate MRACN's superiority in enhancing voltage resilience, reducing operational costs, and improving EV service reliability across both normal and extreme grid scenarios. The results validate MRACN as a scalable, adaptive solution for resilient smart grids in EV-dominated environments. © 2025","Adaptive charging network; Extreme events; Intelligent robot; Power system resilience","Bus transportation; Customer satisfaction; DC distribution systems; Electric power transmission networks; Fleet operations; Integer programming; Lyapunov methods; Multipurpose robots; Nonlinear programming; Traffic congestion; Adaptive charging network; Distribution systems; Extreme conditions; Extreme events; Multi agent; Power; Power system resilience; Real- time; System resiliences; Vehicle pose; Intelligent robots; detection method; distribution system; extreme event; network analysis; prioritization; robotics; safety","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007026518"

A comprehensive review of existing research on demand factor (DF) calculations for EVCSs is presented, highlighting discrepancies in current approaches and identifying key influencing factors. To address these gaps, a simulation model was developed in Python 3.11.9, generating minute-by-minute power consumption profiles based on EVCS parameters, EV fleet characteristics, and charging behavior patterns. In contrast with state-of-the-art methods that often provide limited reference values or scenario-specific analyses, this study quantifies the influence of key factors and demonstrates that the average number of daily charging sessions, EVCS power rating, and the number of charging ports are the most significant determinants of DF. For instance, increasing the number of sessions from 0.5 to 4 per day raises DF by 2.4 times, while higher EVCS power ratings reduce DF by 32–56%. This study proposes a practical generalized algorithm for calculating DF homogeneous and heterogeneous EVCS groups. The proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy (MAPE = 6.01%, R2 = 0.987) compared with existing SOTA approaches, which, when applied to our dataset, yielded significantly higher errors (MAPE of 50.36–67.72%). The derived expressions enable efficient planning of distribution networks, minimizing overestimation of design loads and associated infrastructure costs.

To address this gap, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented restoration optimization model that jointly considers the siting of V2G-enabled charging stations and PDN topology reconfiguration. A novel metric—Resilience Entropy—is introduced to dynamically characterize the recovery process. The model explicitly describes fault propagation and circuit breaker operations, while incorporating power flow and radial topology constraints to ensure secure operation. EV behavioral uncertainty is also considered to enhance model adaptability under real-world post-disaster conditions. The optimal siting scheme is obtained by solving the proposed model.

Traditional deterministic unit commitment models are insufficient for managing such variability in a reliable and cost-effective manner. This study proposes a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model that captures uncertainties in solar photovoltaic generation, electric vehicle charging demand, and load fluctuations using a mixed-integer linear programming framework with recourse. The model is applied to Thailand’s national power system, comprising 171 generators across five regions, to assess its scalability for sustainable large-scale planning. Results indicate that the stochastic model significantly enhances system reliability across most demand profiles. Under the Winter Weekday group, the number of lacking scenarios decreases by 76.92 percent and the number of missing periods decreases by 78.57 percent, while the average and maximum lack percentages are reduced by 56.32 percent and 72.61 percent, respectively. Improvements are even greater under the Rainy Weekday group, where lacking scenarios and periods decline by more than 92 percent and the maximum lack percentage falls by over 98 percent, demonstrating the model’s robustness under volatile solar output and load conditions. Although minor anomalies are observed, such as slight increases in average and maximum lack percentages in the Summer Weekday group, these are minimal and likely attributable to randomness in scenario generation or boundary effects in optimization. Overall, the stochastic model provides substantial advantages in managing uncertainty, achieving notable improvements in reliability with only modest increases in operational cost and computational time. The findings confirm that the proposed approach offers a robust and practical framework for supporting sustainable and resilient power systems in regions with high variability in both generation and demand. © 2025 by the authors.","electric vehicle charging integration; energy sustainability; power system optimization; stochastic unit commitment; uncertainty modeling","Cost effectiveness; Electric power systems; Mixed-integer linear programming; Reliability; Renewable energy; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Vehicles; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging integration; Energy sustainability; Large-scale power systems; Power systems optimizations; Power systems planning; Stochastic unit commitments; Stochastic-modeling; Uncertainty; Uncertainty models; Stochastic models","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) for providing critical data and insights essential to this research.

The proposed framework integrates a hybrid optimisation engine—combining genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning—with a real-time analytics module to enable adaptive scheduling under uncertainty. It accounts for dynamic electricity pricing, EV mobility patterns, and grid load fluctuations, dynamically reallocating charging demand in response to evolving grid conditions. Unlike existing GA/RL schedulers, this framework uniquely integrates adaptive optimisation with resilient forecasting under incomplete data and lightweight blockchain-inspired cyber-defence, thereby addressing efficiency, accuracy, and security simultaneously. To ensure secure and trustworthy EV–grid communication, a lightweight blockchain-inspired protocol is incorporated, supported by an intrusion detection system (IDS) for cyber-attack mitigation. Empirical evaluation using European smart grid datasets demonstrates a daily peak demand reduction of 9.6% (from 33 kWh to 29.8 kWh), with a 27% decrease in energy delivered at the original peak hour and a redistribution of demand that increases delivery at 19:00 h by nearly 25%. Station utilisation became more balanced, with weekly peak normalised utilisation falling from 1.0 to 0.7. The forecasting module achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.25 kWh and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) below 20% even with up to 25% missing data. Among tested models, CatBoost outperformed LightGBM and XGBoost with an RMSE of 0.853 kWh and (Formula presented.) of 0.416. The IDS achieved 94.1% accuracy, an AUC of 0.97, and detected attacks within 50–300 ms, maintaining over 74% detection accuracy under 50% novel attack scenarios. The optimisation runtime remained below 0.4 s even at five times the nominal dataset scale. Additionally, the study outlines a conceptual extension to support location-based planning of charging infrastructure. This proposes the alignment of infrastructure roll-out with forecasted demand to enhance spatial deployment efficiency.

While fast charging offers the advantage of reduced charging time and improved user convenience, it imposes considerable stress on existing power distribution systems due to its high power and current requirements. This study investigated the impact of EV fast charging on power quality within Thailand’s distribution network, emphasizing compliance with accepted standards such as IEEE Std 519-2014. We developed a control-oriented EV-charging station model in power systems computer-aided design and electromagnetic transients, including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC), which integrates grid-side vector control with DC fast-charging (CC/CV) behavior. Active/reactive power setpoints were mapped onto (Formula presented.) current references via Park’s transformation and regulated by proportional integral (PI) controllers with sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM) to command the voltage source converter (VSC) switches. The model enabled dynamic studies across battery state-of-charge and staggered charging schedules while monitoring voltage, current, and total harmonic distortion (THD) at both transformer sides, charger AC terminals, and DC adapters. Across all scenarios, the developed control achieved grid-current THDi of <5% and voltage THD of <1.5%, thereby meeting IEEE 519-2014 limits. These quantitative results show that the proposed, implementation-ready approach maintains acceptable power quality under diverse fast-charging patterns and provides actionable guidance for planning and scaling EV fast-charging infrastructure in Thailand’s urban networks. © 2025 by the authors.","distribution system; EV charging; EV station; fast charge; harmonic distortion; power quality","Battery management systems; Charging stations; Computer control systems; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Fast charging (Batteries); IEEE Standards; Power systems computer aided design; Proportional control systems; Regulatory compliance; Vector control (Electric machinery); Voltage control; Charging station; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle station; Fast charges; Fast charging; Harmonics distortion; Power; Power quality assessment; Thailand; Power quality","This research was funded by the Srinakharinwirot University Research Fund.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015453177"

We present a Nash-equilibrium-based Iterative Best Response Algorithm (IBRA-NE) for joint planning of DG and EVCS in radial distribution networks. The framework supports two applicability modes: (i) a DSO-plannable mode that co-optimizes EVCS siting/sizing and utility-controlled reactive support (DG operated as VAR resources or functionally equivalent devices), and (ii) a customer-sited mode that treats DG locations as fixed while optimizing DG reactive set-points/sizes and EVCS siting. The objective minimizes network losses and voltage deviation while incorporating deployment costs and EV charging service penalties, subject to standard operating limits. A backward/forward sweep (BFS) load flow with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) captures load and generation uncertainty; a Bus Voltage Deviation Index (BVDI) helps identify weak buses. On the EEU 114-bus system, the method reduces base-case losses by up to 57.9% and improves minimum bus voltage from 0.757 p.u. to 0.931 p.u.; performance remains robust under a 20% load increase. The framework explicitly accommodates regulatory contexts where DG siting is customer-driven by treating DG locations as fixed in such cases while optimizing EVCS siting and sizing under DSO planning authority. A mixed scenario with 5 DGs and 3 EVCS demonstrates coordinated benefits and convergence properties relative to PSO, GWO, RFO, and ARFO. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is also tested on the IEEE 69-bus system and results in acceptable performance. The results indicate that game-theoretic coordination, applied in a manner consistent with regulatory roles, provides a practical pathway for DSOs to plan EV infrastructure and reactive support in networks with uncertain DER behavior. © 2025 by the authors.","Distributed Generators; electric-vehicle charging station; game theory; Iterative Best Response Algorithm; Nash Equilibrium","Buses; Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Digital instruments; Distributed power generation; Electric load distribution; Electric load flow; Electric vehicles; Iterative methods; Load flow optimization; Nash equilibrium; Sales; Best response; Charging station; Distributed generators; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Electric-vehicle charging station; Iterative best response algorithm; Nash equilibria; Response algorithms; System operator; Game theory","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015399970"

The proposed station comprises facilities for hydrogen fueling and electric vehicle charging stations, structured as a bi-level optimization approach. The upper-level model focuses on the planning phase of the refueling station. Its objective is to minimize annual costs associated with construction, maintenance, and operation. Key constraints involve operational planning for renewable sources, battery systems, and vehicle refueling stations while accounting for reactive power management. In contrast, the lower-level formulation deals with the eco-scheduling of smart distribution grid. Its goal is to minimize the sum of annual energy losses and operation costs within the grid, governed by linearized optimal power flow model. To account for uncertainties in demand, energy prices, renewable generation output, and refueling station performance, a stochastic optimization framework is employed. The solution is derived using Benders decomposition algorithm to achieve optimal results. The primary innovation highlighted in this paper includes integrating renewable resources and battery systems to power the refueling station, leveraging reactive power control for improved station performance, and addressing both operational and economic objectives in the distribution system. Numerical results underscore the advantages of this strategy. Constructing a refueling station without battery and renewable units leads to significant drawbacks, an increase in network operation cost by 144.6 % and grid energy loss by 167.6 %. Voltage levels drop below 0.9 per-unit, and distribution lines experience severe loading of up to 34.7 %. In contrast, the proposed plan enhances network economics by 51.3 %-74.5 % and operational conditions by 17.7 %-148.1 %, effectively showcasing the benefits of incorporating sustainable technologies and advanced planning methods into refueling station development. © 2025 The Author(s)","Battery system; Electric vehicles charging station; Hydrogen fueling station; Siting and sizing; Smart distribution network","Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Electric power system economics; Electric vehicles; Energy dissipation; Fueling; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Optimization; Power control; Reactive power; Renewable energy; Secondary batteries; Smart power grids; Battery systems; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Hydrogen fuelling; Hydrogen fuelling stations; Renewables; Siting and sizings; Smart distribution networks; Vehicle refueling; Stochastic systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014000550"

The large-scale deployment of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) introduces operational issues such as elevated power losses, voltage instability, and line overloading, thereby testing the grid's robustness and efficiency. To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel optimization framework that integrates the quasi-refined slime mould algorithm (QRSMA) with conventional slime mould algorithm (SMA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques for the optimal placement of solar-based distributed generators (SDGs) and shunt capacitors (SCs). The proposed method aims to minimize a multi-objective function incorporating real and reactive power losses, voltage deviation, and voltage stability, thereby enhancing the stability and reliability of RDN operations. The framework employs stochastic modeling based on four years of hourly meteorological data to account for uncertainties in solar irradiance and temperature. Additionally, the EVCS model includes dynamic operational aspects such as mean queue lengths, waiting times, and demand response (DR) load control. The methodology is validated using both a practical Indian 28-bus RDN and the large-scale IEEE 118-bus system to assess scalability and generalizability. Simulation results confirm the superior performance of QRSMA in improving voltage profiles, reducing power losses, and achieving better computational efficiency compared to conventional optimization algorithms. Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the robustness of QRSMA under varying objective priorities. Moreover, the economic assessment using the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) indicates strong financial viability for real-world implementation.

Consequently, the adoption of electric vehicle fleets for freight movement and last-mile deliveries is in progress: this transition is viable if sufficient electric charging infrastructures are available within their operating routes. However, allocation of chargers at city centres may pose problems related to congestions in the power distribution network during peak hours, along with possible peaks in renewable energy sources production. This paper presents a mathematical programming formulation for the optimal allocation and sizing of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure within an urban area in which a fleet of electric vehicles for freight delivery operates. The considered urban area is divided into peripheral and internal zones, with the former able to host depots and large electric vehicle charging hubs and the latter hosting smaller electric vehicle charging areas. The optimization problem, formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, aims to allocate and size the photovoltaic units, the battery energy storage systems and the electric vehicle chargers to be installed in each zone, depending on local requirements, while allowing the electric vehicle fleet to satisfy the predefined logistic demand in the considered zones. The model is applied to a delivery fleet operating in the city of Milan, Italy, considering various scenarios and making some sensitivity analyses for evaluating the impact of economic parameters on the optimal configuration of the facility. The results show that photovoltaic units are a viable solution towards sustainable logistics, while the installation of battery energy storage systems is not always favorable.

This paper introduces a robust and uncertainty-conscious optimization framework for the strategic integration of BEV charging infrastructure into unbalanced distribution systems. The proposed approach incorporates key sources of uncertainty, such as variability in base electrical loads, intermittent outputs from renewable energy sources (RESs), and stochastic patterns of BEV charging behavior, using Hong's Three-Point Estimate Method (H3PEM). Also, a novel Advanced Multi-objective Growth Optimizer (AMOGO) is developed to achieve a balanced optimization across technical and planning objectives, including the minimization of total active losses, the improvement of the Total Voltage Stability Index (TVSI), and the maximization of the network's BEV hosting capacity. The proposed strategy is validated on the widely recognized IEEE 123-bus unbalanced system under multiple operational scenarios, each differing in the number and capacity of installed charging stations. Benchmark comparisons with established metaheuristic algorithms of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the original GO, and the Enzyme Action Optimizer (EAO) highlight AMOGO's superior performance. Results show that AMOGO not only exhibits faster and more stable convergence but also achieves significant enhancements in system efficiency and resilience, with a 72.7 % reduction in power losses and a 10.51 % improvement in voltage stability.

Accurately characterizing the dynamic coupling between TN and PDN is crucial. However, existing literature exhibits significant deficiencies in modeling the travel behaviors of gasoline vehicles (GVs) and EVs, as well as the propagation characteristics of mixed traffic networks. Moreover, it overlooks the queuing capacity limits of FCSs and the impact of queue overflow on TN. To address these issues, this study presents a stochastic dynamic user equilibrium (SDUE) modeling framework for coupled networks considering EVs charging behavior. This framework comprehensively captures the dynamic interactions among departure times, path choices, FCS choices, and electricity prices within the TN and PDN. To capture the traffic dynamics, a multi-class traffic flow propagation model for EVs and GVs, considering EV charging behavior, is developed. Additionally, an improved fixed-point algorithm is proposed to obtain the dynamic equilibrium state of the coupled networks. Case studies reveal that reducing FCS capacity degrades overall network performance. Therefore, it is essential to consider queue overflow when devising traffic policies to enhance network performance and assessing the layout of FCSs. Furthermore, the results indicate that the coupled operation strategy, in comparison to independent operation strategies, can reduce total traffic delay costs by 28.4%, decrease average waiting time at FCSs by 28.7%, and lower power losses by 11.7%. These findings underscore the significance of collaborative management and planning of TN and PDN in response to the escalating demand for EVs. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Charging behavior; Dynamic equilibrium; Electric vehicle; Power network; Transportation network","Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Motor transportation; Queueing theory; Stochastic systems; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Charging behavior; Coupled networks; Dynamic equilibrium; Electric vehicle charging; Fast charging stations; Gasoline vehicle; Network distributions; Power distribution network; Power networks; Transportation network; Electric vehicles; electric vehicle; management; network analysis; transportation planning; travel behavior","This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2023YFB4301900), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52472319).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010955611"

Achieving accurate LTLF is not only crucial for grid planning and operation but also provides a scientific foundation for power dispatch, ensuring efficient energy use and maintaining supply–demand balance. However, the nonlinearity, periodicity, and temporality of load pose multiple challenges to LTLF. In this paper, a long-term load forecasting model based on a decomposable multi-period mixing algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the features that may affect load are analyzed and selected. Secondly, by combining load decomposition methods with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) structure, a long-term point forecasting approach based on a decomposable multi-period mixing algorithm is proposed. Thirdly, a probabilistic forecasting method is proposed on the basis of this model. This method utilizes a residual simulation technique to quantify the uncertainty of LTLF, effectively complementing the point forecasting results. Finally, the model's effectiveness is validated across datasets from a Chinese dataset, Australian electricity markets, and GEFCom2014, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy and computational efficiency. © 2025 The Authors","Load decomposition; Long-term load forecasting; Multilayer perceptron; Point forecasting; Probabilistic forecasting","Electric load dispatching; Electric load forecasting; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Multilayers; Smart power grids; Technological forecasting; Uncertainty analysis; Load decompositions; Long-term load forecasting; Mixing algorithms; Multi-period; Multilayers perceptrons; Point forecasting; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Vehicle energy; Computational efficiency; Mixing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010151541"

Battery-based solutions can be operated following different control objectives and support the grid to reduce the investment need in conventional assets. A grid planning algorithm is developed to perform this comparison. The impact of the rollout of distributed energy resources on a Danish urban grid is assessed, based on a forecasted scenario and the geographical distribution of new loads and generators until 2045. Fast charging stations are added to this rollout, and the resulting grid issues are mitigated using a conventional grid reinforcement method. In a second iteration, batteries are installed in combination with fast charging stations to support them. The remaining capacity is used to solve the previously mentioned grid issues, using controllers that achieve good performance. The technical and economic impact of the conventional grid reinforcement and the battery-based one are compared in a cost–benefit analysis. Depending on cost sensitivities, the battery-based alternative can range from being 40 % cheaper to over 1400 % more expensive than a conventional grid extension—despite potential investment deferrals, which are often outweighed by higher capital costs and energy losses. Across all battery connection topologies and price sensitivities, the conventional grid upgrade solution remains the most cost-efficient one in 89 % of all investigated cases, with the battery-buffered one being only competitive in edge cases. © 2025 The Author(s)","Batteries; Battery sizing optimisation; Distributed energy resources; Distribution networks; Electric vehicles; Fast charging; Grid planning","Automotive batteries; Battery management systems; Costs; Distributed energy; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Fast charging (Batteries); Geographical distribution; Investments; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery; Battery sizing optimization; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric grids; Fast charging; Fast charging stations; Grid planning; Grid reinforcement; Sizing optimization; Techno-economic comparisons; Electric vehicles","Charalampos Ziras and Mattia Marinelli would like to acknowledge the financial support by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme through the EV4EU project (Grant Agreement No. 101056765 ).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009880268"

At the same time, this integrates millions of mobile storage units into the electricity system, which has a rising need for flexibility to balance the intermittent generation from photovoltaic systems and wind turbines. To capture the potential of electric cars as a flexibility resource, we simulate 7,000 vehicle driving profiles in an agent-based model, generating load profiles as well as charging power and state-of-charge boundaries for the German car fleet, which serve as restrictions in energy system optimization. In a scenario-based study for Germany in 2030 and 2045, we compare the installed electric capacities in the optimized system, depending on whether electric vehicle charging is uncontrolled, controlled, or bidirectional. Here we show that a bidirectionally charged car fleet has the potential to replace 32 GW (84 %) of stationary battery storage and 31 GW (64 %) of hydrogen-fired peaking power plants, while enabling an additional solar power expansion of 7 GW (2 %) until 2045. Notably, implementing vehicle-to-grid can limit hydrogen-fired electricity generation to winter months and enable a shift toward combined heat and power plants. On the demand side, it can reduce the expansion of electrolyzers by 19 GW (28 %) and power-to-heat capacities by 25 GW (60 %).

As EV and renewable energy source (RES) penetration increases, coordinated EV charging and discharging becomes critical for reducing power losses, improving voltage profiles, and supporting energy storage management. Traditional optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) often struggle with the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of EV-grid interaction problems. In contrast, Quantum Annealing (QA) leverages quantum tunneling and parallelism to efficiently explore complex solution spaces. The proposed approach formulates the EV parking scheduling task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, suitable for quantum processing. Simulation studies on IEEE 13-, 33-, and 69-bus systems show that QA significantly outperforms GA and PSO. Notably, in the 13-bus network, QA reduced power losses by 72.07 % and voltage deviation by 87.5 %; corresponding reductions in 33- and 69-bus systems were 42.1 % and 46.6 %, respectively. The results demonstrate the method's scalability and effectiveness in handling real-time EV integration while reducing operational costs and supporting voltage stability. From a societal perspective, the framework facilitates cleaner energy usage and more intelligent urban EV infrastructure planning. However, limitations include the reliance on quantum simulators (rather than physical hardware) and the assumption of deterministic EV behavior. Future research will investigate hybrid quantum-classical implementations and stochastic modeling using real-world data. Overall, this study presents a robust and scalable optimization strategy for building more efficient, resilient, and sustainable smart distribution systems. © 2025","Distribution Network (DN); Electrical Vehicle (EV); Optimization Algorithms; Power Loss Reduction; Quantum Annealing (QA); Voltage Profile Improvement","Digital storage; Electric losses; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Quantum theory; Renewable energy; Stochastic models; Vehicles; Distribution network; Electrical vehicle; Electrical vehicles; Optimization algorithms; Power loss reduction; Powerloss; Quantum annealing; Vehicle parking; Voltage profile improvement; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Stochastic systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008805132"

However, their stochastic load characteristics on the radial distribution network (RDN) pose challenges such as power quality issues and increased network losses. This paper proposes an approach to strategically deploy EV charging stations (EVCS) integrated with photovoltaic (PV) units in RDN. The main objective is to reduce real power loss and enhance the reliability indices. The scenarios that include and exclude PV units have been considered to analyze the impact of introducing PV in the RDN with different EVCS loads. The capacity of the PV unit has also been optimized in this work. The proposed methodology has been assessed by using the IEEE 69 bus RDN. The IEEE 69 bus RDN has been divided into four zones and each zone consists of one EVCS and one PV to ensure widespread charging facilities and improve the network performance. The backward forward sweep power flow technique has been applied to perform the analysis by considering the variable parameters of the electrical system. The issues have been framed as an optimization task and tackled by applying the symbiotic organisms search technique. The outcomes have been compared with Grey Wolf Optimizer, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to validate the effectiveness of the optimal planning to allocate the EVCS and PV units. The methodology is validated through multiscenario optimization on the IEEE 69-bus system and a case study-based static and dynamic simulation on the IEEE 13-bus feeder. These simulations, conducted using MATLAB and OpenDSS, confirm both the steady-state accuracy and the real-time operational feasibility of the proposed planning strategy. © The Author(s) 2025.

This study proposes a smart and integrated framework designed to enhance system resilience by leveraging coordinated multi-energy microgrids (MGs) and distributed energy resources (DERs). The proposed framework introduces four key components: (1) a spatiotemporal resilience assessment approach incorporating robustness, survivability, and recoverability indices; (2) a hierarchical control architecture for MG coordination; (3) a hybrid stochastic–robust optimization model to balance operational efficiency and resilience objectives; and (4) data-driven, self-learning decision-making mechanisms enabled by real-time analytics. The framework is implemented on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system with integrated electrical, thermal, and gas subsystems. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a 60% reduction in outage duration, 95% retention of critical loads during contingencies, and a 52.5% reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions per event. Notable innovations include the integration of bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) support, dynamic DER dispatch, and multi-domain resilience metrics. Despite resilience gains, trade-offs were observed—most notably, an active power loss of 8613.89 kW associated with a resilience index of –35.61—underscoring the need for adaptive weight tuning in multi-objective optimization.

This study aims to better understand the potential of leveraging EVs’ charging flexibility as energy storage to smooth daily power load profiles considering different solar and EV penetration levels. To achieve this goal, we propose a mathematical formulation of the charging flexibility set based on real daily trip-chain data and develop a convex optimization model to optimize the smoothness of the regional net load profile subject to the charging flexibility set. We implement the model using mobility, solar generation, and power load data in the service region of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP). Through sensitivity analyses, we quantify the potential impacts of EVs on the power systems at different levels of EV penetration, charging infrastructure availability, power load, and solar generation. The results demonstrate that EVs have the potential to smooth the overall power load if their charging/discharging scheduling can be properly coordinated. In particular, EVs can reduce the maximum ramping caused by uncoordinated charging by 65 % through the use of managed charging/discharging capabilities. Additionally, providing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities at the existing public charging stations can lead to a 29 % ramp decrease compared with only allowing V2G at home. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Charging flexibility; Controllable charging; Duck curve; Electric vehicle (EV); Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Electric load distribution; Electric load forecasting; Electric power plant loads; Sensitivity analysis; Solar fuels; Charging flexibility; Controllable charging; Duck curve; Electric vehicle; Load profiles; Power; Power load; Vehicle penetration; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle-to-grid (V2G); Convex optimization","Zhaomiao Guo reports financial support was provided by National Science Foundation, under Grant No. 2521735.

An important upgrading feature of the cyber-side is the electrical grid monitoring, which needs to expand both in data coverage and granularity. The challenge is to decide the data strategy, or in other words, which level of granularity is actually needed in active distribution networks. This work proposes a framework to assist grid planners in selecting the level of data expansion needed, by quantifying the impact of extended data granularity on control capabilities, and corresponding grid performance. The framework combines machine learning with AC optimal power flow and state estimation to select incremental upgrades of the cyber-physical infrastructure. Grid planning and operation are simulated and tested for the IEEE 33-bus test system over a 5-year span to assess the role of granularity in grid performance for different cyber-infrastructures. The results show that extending data granularity is critical for mitigating voltage violations under high penetration of EVs, air conditioning and PVs.

However, for the effective deployment of EVs, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) must be built quickly and with careful planning. Moreover, mismatch of generation demand, active power losses, compromised voltage profile and voltage stability reduction issues are faced due to the rapid raise of electric load penetration. To address these concerns, a well-planned integration of EVCS with Distributed Generations (DGs) at strategic locations with appropriate capacity becomes essential. Load Flow Analysis is utilized to find power losses for each branch and voltage magnitudes for all buses. The IEEE 69 bus is employed with the Backward-Forward Sweep method for Radial Distribution Systems, and the IEEE 118 bus is a non-radial DS solved with the Newton–Raphson (NR) method. In this research, the accurate determination of optimal locations and capacities for placing EVCS in conjunction with DGs is achieved by utilizing a hybridized optimization technique called Hybrid Moth Flame Optimization (HMFO) which is formed by hybridizing the characteristics of moth and firefly optimization algorithms. The utilization of HMFO results in improved outcomes, including rapid convergence, robustness, and enhanced identification of EVCS deployment locations. Consequently, this optimization approach leads to reduced real and reactive power losses, diminished voltage deviations, increased voltage stability, cost-effectiveness, and accurate determination of EVCS location, and size.

Additionally, it characterizes EC behavior in terms of demand and energy trading, identifying hours with a higher likelihood of flexibility provision and estimating the potential quantity of such services. To generate the data, two optimization models were developed to simulate EC operations, focusing on peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and evaluating the EC's capability to provide flexibility as a service to the DSO. The models employ a second-order cone programming formulation incorporating distribution network (DN) constraints and considering different DERs, including rooftop solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and heat pumps. Simulations were performed over a one-year horizon with hourly resolution using a modified single-phase version of the IEEE European Low Voltage test feeder, ensuring sufficient annual data for statistical analysis. As a result, the identified statistical patterns could assist the DSO in planning operations based only on aggregated community data, avoiding the need to model individual user decisions and ensuring data privacy. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy resources; Distribution network; Local flexibility market; P2P energy trading; Second-order cone programming","Sales; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Energy; Energy trading; Local flexibility; Local flexibility market; P2P energy trading; Second-order cone programming; Statistical pattern; System operator; Population statistics","The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of the TED2021-131365B-C41, PID2021-128574OB-I00, and RYC2021-033477-I grants, funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by the European Union \u201CNextGenerationEU\u201D/PRTR, and this work has been supported by ANID FONDECYT Iniciaci\u00F3n 11240745.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007066152"

A key aspect of this transition is the strategic planning and optimization of the locations of electric vehicle charging stations. The distribution of charging stations is influenced by various factors, including drivers habits, population density, road infrastructure etc. This paper aims to determine the optimal geographical locations and capacities of electric vehicle charging stations by balancing these factors along with budget constraints. A two-stage optimization algorithm is developed using graph-modeled data. The first stage focuses on preliminary planning, considering consumer satisfaction, traffic, electrical grid infrastructure, and construction costs. The second stage refines the optimization using simulation-generated statistics, including waiting times, system utilization and charging stations availability. Novel custom mutation and crossover operations are introduced in the genetic algorithm to enhance the optimization process. Proposed modified genetic algorithm outperforms the standard genetic algorithm by providing solutions that improve the utilization rate while simultaneously enhancing user satisfaction.

To accommodate high-penetration PVs integration while maintaining economic efficiency and flexibility of ADN, a bi-level collaborative expansion planning model considering uncertainty generation and reduction is proposed in this paper. Based on described uncertainty scenarios of PV and load obtained by proposed Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and K-means method, the upper level firstly configures soft open points to adjust the ADN topology, then optimizes the siting and sizing of PVs, electric vehicle charging stations, energy storage systems, and active management resources (on-load tap changers, and static var compensators) with minimum investment cost. Lower level uses multi-objective mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model with network loss, PV curtailment and voltage deviation of different attributes to optimize ADN scheduling. To solve this planning model, a hybrid algorithm that integrates an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm with SOCP is proposed, employing the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) to address the multi-objective issue. Finally, the presented model was tested in the actual rural 41-bus and urban 40-bus ADN of Gansu, China, demonstrating that total costs decreased by 14.4 % and 12.5 % respectively compared to plans without active management resources. © 2025","Active distribution network; Expansion planning; High-penetration photovoltaics; Uncertainty; WGAN-GP","Integer programming; Resource allocation; Virtual storage; Active distribution network; Active distributions; Active management; Adversarial networks; Expansion planning; High-penetration photovoltaic; Photovoltaics; Planning models; Uncertainty; Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); algorithm; artificial neural network; distribution system; energy storage; optimization; photovoltaic system; resource management; uncertainty analysis","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62192753 , 62133008 ), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2023YFB4004500 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006511367"

Existing literature lacks comprehensive vehicle-to-grid (V2G) impact analyses and methodologies for long-term integration, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, the absence of optimized short-term operational models for EV integration poses challenges in grid management. To bridge these gaps, this research proposes a socio-economic model to estimate EV sales based on the Bass diffusion model and macroeconomic regressions. Additionally, it integrates electricity system expansion planning using the OSeMOSYS tool with a short-term operational model based on unit commitment. In this context, this work endeavors to develop a methodology for estimating the impact of V2G technology, considering both the deployment and utilization of EVs in a Brazilian case study. Applying traditional methodologies that do not consider operational system models can lead to potential future load shedding. It may accentuate disparities between long-term and short-term outcomes, especially with EV and V2G integration. The proposed methodology corrected the overestimation of the energy injection potential of EVs by the traditional model, indicating the need to consider both the expansion and the operation of the electricity system when planning the integration of EVs. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Diffusion model; Electric system modeling; Electric vehicles; Optimization; Vehicle-to-grid","DC power transmission; Dynamic programming; Electric power system economics; Electric power system planning; Linear programming; Power distribution planning; Smart power grids; System theory; Diffusion model; Electric system modeling; Electric systems; Electricity system; Grid integration; Operational modeling; Optimisations; Power system expansion planning; System models; Vehicle to grids; Electric power transmission networks","The authors thank the Coordena\u00E7\u00E3o de Aperfei\u00E7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00EDvel Superior (CAPES) under Grant 001 , Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00EDfico e Tecnol\u00F3gico (CNPq) under grants 404068/2020-0 , Funda\u00E7\u00E3o de Amparo \u00E0 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) under grant APQ-03609-17 (Instituto Nacional de Ci\u00EAncia e Tecnologia em Energia El\u00E9trica -INERGE), Funda\u00E7\u00E3o Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo \u00E0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) under grant SEI 260003/006613/2022 .

To highlight its advantages, extensive studies have been conducted on the techno-economic and environmental impacts of integrating RESs and ESSs into EVCSs. However, important aspects such as load management capabilities and the operational efficiency of these systems in EVCSs have received comparatively little attention. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the load management and operational efficiency of combining RESs and ESSs with ultra-fast direct current chargers (UFCs) in an EVCS. It conducts a hypothetical case study on a commercial Evie network (charging company) charging station having 4 ultra-fast charging ports, in Australia, to investigate three load management strategies: 1) user-preferred, 2) grid-preferred, and 3) renewable energy resources - battery energy storage integrated systems (ReBIS). The study investigates the load management and operational effectiveness of these strategies in combination with techno-economic analysis. It highlights that the ReBIS effectively reduces grid peak demand, maximizes charging sessions, alleviates grid strains, and balances both user and grid charging preferences. Simulation results indicate that ReBIS with UFCs lowers energy costs by 40 %, supports 99.4 % of user-preferred charging sessions, and cuts carbon emissions by 63.2 % and 65.2 % compared to user-preferred and grid-preferred modes, respectively. The results validate ReBIS with UFCs as the optimal load management strategy for EVs, balancing charging demand with grid stability. © 2025 The Authors","Battery energy storage system; Electric vehicles; Environmental sustainability; Grid stability; Peak load management; Renewable energy resources","Demand side management; Electric load dispatching; Electric load distribution; Electric load forecasting; Fast charging (Batteries); Resource allocation; Solar fuels; Strategic planning; Battery energy storage systems; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Energy; Environmental sustainability; Grid stability; Peak load; Peak load management; Renewable energies; Storage systems; Battery storage; alternative energy; battery; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy management; energy resource; energy storage; environmental impact; renewable resource; smart grid; Australia","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005173761"

Unlike conventional approaches that primarily focus on cost, the proposed method explicitly accounts for the risk associated with variations in operating conditions due to uncertainties in load demand and distributed generation (DG) output. Additionally, it enhances the adaptability of network planning by considering flexibility in RES installation capacity as a decision variable. To manage these uncertainties, a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) generates diverse operating scenarios, which are refined through scenario reduction techniques to improve computational efficiency. A genetic algorithm (GA) determines the optimal HDN configuration, while the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) computes the optimal power flow (OPF) for each scenario. A fuzzy satisfying method is applied to balance trade-offs between conflicting objectives. The proposed framework is validated through a comprehensive case study involving photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind-based DGs, and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.

However, their effectiveness critically depends on EV drivers’ willingness to participate, which is shaped by behavioral heterogeneity and operational constraints. While previous studies have explored participation preferences, they have largely overlooked time-specific availability and its implications for system-level flexibility. This study addresses this gap by integrating a discrete choice experiment with latent class modeling to analyze both user preferences and the peak shaving potential of V2G. To capture temporal availability more accurately, “weekday connection time” is introduced as a novel contract attribute, enabling realistic estimates of time-specific charging and discharging flexibility. The analysis identifies three distinct driver segments, each characterized by unique preferences for monetary incentives, minimum connection days, charger accessibility, weekday connection frequency, and state-of-charge guarantees. Scenario-based simulations incorporating these heterogeneous profiles indicate that tailored V2G program designs could reduce peak net load by up to 22.9 % by 2030. These findings underscore the importance of differentiated policy instruments and aggregator strategies that reflect user diversity.

This paper investigates the definition, quantification criteria, and multi-indicator comprehensive determination methods for weak nodes in distribution networks. A multi-criteria assessment method integrating voltage deviation rate, sensitivity analysis, and power margin has been proposed. This method quantifies the node disturbance resistance and comprehensively evaluates the vulnerability of voltage stability. Simulation validation based on the IEEE 33-node system demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively identify the distribution patterns of weak nodes under different penetration levels (20~80%) and varying numbers of DPV access points (single-point to multi-point distributed access scenarios). The study reveals the impact of increased penetration and dispersed access locations on the migration characteristics of weak nodes. The research findings provide a theoretical basis for the planning of distribution networks with high-penetration DPV, offering valuable insights for optimizing the siting of volatile loads such as electric vehicle (EV) charging stations while considering both grid safety and the demand for distributed energy accommodation. © 2025 by the authors.","distributed photovoltaic; distribution network; electric vehicle; weak nodes","Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Photovoltaics; Power distribution networks; Power distribution reliability; Sensitivity analysis; Stability criteria; Voltage control; Charging station planning; Distributed photovoltaic; Electric vehicle charging; Identification method; Large-scales; Power flow characteristics; Reverse Power flows; Scale integration; Weak node; Electric vehicles","This research was funded by the Science and Technique Project Funds of State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power (grant number: J2024060).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014318943"

An improved capacitor placement method using IGWO with zone-based control optimizes voltage profiles, minimizes power losses and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in unbalanced distribution systems. The best case involved placing unbalanced capacitors and PV systems using a distributed, zone-based control strategy to handle high EV fast-charging demand. What is the implication of the main finding? Coordinated zone-based placement of renewable energy and reactive power devices enhance grid resilience and operational efficiency in EV-dominated smart city networks. The proposed method provides a practical and scalable approach for planners to support sustainable electrification, reduce environmental impact and improve power quality in modern distribution systems. The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increasing use of photovoltaic (PV) generation have introduced new operational challenges for unbalanced power distribution systems. These include elevated power losses, voltage imbalances, and adverse environmental impacts. This study proposed a hybrid objective optimization framework to address these issues by minimizing real and reactive power losses, voltage deviations, voltage imbalance indexes, and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Nineteen simulation cases were analyzed under various configurations incorporating EV integration, PV deployment, reactive power compensation, and zonal control strategies. An improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO) was employed to determine optimal placements and control settings. Among all cases, Case 16 yielded the lowest objective function value, representing the most effective trade-off between technical performance, voltage stability, and sustainability. The optimized configuration significantly improved the voltage balance, reduced system losses, and maintained the average voltage within acceptable limits. Additionally, all optimized scenarios achieved meaningful reductions in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions compared to the base case. The results were validated with an objective function (Formula presented.) as a reliable composite performance index and demonstrated the effectiveness of coordinated zone-based optimization. This approach provides practical insights for future smart grid planning under dynamic, renewable, rich, and EV-dominated operating conditions. © 2025 by the authors.","capacitor placement; CO2 emissions; distribution system planning; electric vehicles; hybrid objective optimization; IGWO; photovoltaic integration; reactive power support; smart grid; unbalanced power flow; voltage improvement","","All authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the following: High-Performance Post-Doctoral and Post-Master-Level Research Personnel Development Project in Leading-Edge Research in Materials Technology to Drive the Clean Energy Industry [contract code: B13F680080]; and Intelligent Power System and Energy Research (IPER), Department of Electrical engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Rajamangala University of Technology Isan, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014287634"

However, the inherent uncertainty in electric vehicle (EV) behavior—including arrival times, charging preferences, and state-of-charge—as well as spatially and temporally variable solar generation, presents a profound challenge to existing scheduling frameworks. This paper proposes a novel data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DDRO) framework for solar-powered EV charging coordination under spatiotemporal uncertainty. Leveraging empirical datasets of EV usage and solar irradiance from a smart city deployment, the framework constructs Wasserstein ambiguity sets around historical distributions, enabling worst-case-aware decision-making without requiring the assumption of probability laws. The problem is formulated as a two-stage optimization model. The first stage determines day-ahead charging schedules, solar utilization levels, and grid allocations across an urban-scale distribution feeder. The second stage models real-time recourse actions—such as dynamic curtailment or demand reshaping—after uncertainties are realized. Physical grid constraints are modeled using convexified LinDistFlow equations, while EV behavior is segmented into user classes with individualized uncertainty structures. The model is evaluated on a modified IEEE 123-bus feeder with 52 EV-PV nodes, using 15 min resolution over a 24 h horizon and 12 months of real-world data. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed DDRO method reduces total operational costs by up to 15%, eliminates voltage violations entirely, and improves EV service satisfaction by more than 30% relative to deterministic and stochastic baselines. This work makes three primary contributions: it introduces a robust, tractable optimization architecture that captures spatiotemporal uncertainty using empirical Wasserstein sets; it integrates behavioral and physical modeling within a unified dispatch framework for urban energy-mobility systems; and it demonstrates the value of robust coordination in simultaneously improving grid resilience, renewable utilization, and EV user satisfaction. The results offer practical insights for city-scale planners seeking to enable the reliable and efficient electrification of mobility infrastructure under uncertainty. © 2025 by the authors.","distributionally robust optimization; electric vehicles; solar photovoltaics; two-stage scheduling; uncertainty modeling; urban distribution systems","Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Decision making; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Electrification; Geographical distribution; Optimization; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Data driven; Distributionally robust optimization; Electric vehicle charging; Robust optimization; Solar photovoltaics; Solar-powered; Two-stage scheduling; Uncertainty; Uncertainty models; Urban distribution systems; Electric vehicles","This research was funded by 1. the State Grid scientific and technological projects of Tianjin Electric Power Company (DK-YF 2023-51). 2.

To address these issues, this study proposes a real-time nested scheduling model with an adaptive charging–discharging strategy for community, supermarket, and street parking facilities. The model employs an adaptive approach where EV users provide essential information upon arrival at the microgrid (MG), choosing between unordered or ordered participation based on their preferences. A priority-based two-stage schedule planning strategy is implemented, first planning the overall charging–discharging power for the EV cluster, then refining individual EV power based on priorities. For EVs requiring early departure, priorities are adjusted to ensure the expected State of Charge is reached before leaving. The model features a real-time nested framework with a bi-level optimization outer layer to coordinate conflicting interests among entities and an inner layer for EV power allocation. To address high uncertainties, a Model Predictive Control algorithm is employed, incorporating Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, strong duality theorem, and linearization techniques.

Firstly, a dynamic charging and discharging boundary aggregation model of EV cluster is constructed based on the EV individual power feasible domain model. Secondly, using the carbon emission flow theory as a tool, a two-layer low-carbon planning model of distribution network considering EV orderly charge and discharge is established. The upper layer plans the distribution network lines, two-way charging piles, and intelligent soft open point (SOP), while the lower layer optimizes EV charge and discharge strategy and user consumption strategy with the goal of minimum comprehensive operating cost. Then, the two-layer nonlinear model is transformed into a single-layer mixed-integer second-order cone programming model by means of upper-lower linkage, large M method and second-order cone relaxation, which is solved by commercial solvers.

In contrast, solar power is less efficient than wind power in terms of converting sunlight into electricity. Moreover, combination of wind power and solar power is most popular green energy alternatives among the various renewable energy sources because solar energy cannot be harnessed at night while wind energy can be harnessed even at night. So, it is getting harder to use renewable energy sources (RESs). However, fossil fuels are the main reasons for toxic and most dangerous pollution. In this research, hydro–thermal scheduling (HTS) problem integrating wind, solar, and EVs is examined using a novel method called the moth-flame optimization algorithm (MFO). The suggested HTS problem’s main goal is to reduce the cost of power generation while satisfying several kinds of constraints, including losses occurring in the transmission, the effect of valve point on the thermal unit, and the unpredictability of RESs. Many electric vehicles (EVs), often referred to as cloud-based distributed power plants, are being developed as virtual power plants (VPPs), which are combined with clean energy sources to efficiently manage energy control. The objective of this presentation is to meet every constraint while reducing fuel costs. This is accomplished by balancing load demand and losses occurring in the transmission line while meeting every condition. By analyzing the generation cost using MFO, the effectiveness of the system is carried out and being compared with the others newly developed existing optimization methods to show the higher efficacy, usefulness, as well as robustness of proposed optimization technique. The result shows that a group of electric vehicles participating in renewable energy integrated hydro–thermal scheduling arrangement by consuming the power from grid. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Electric vehicles (EVs); Hydro–thermal generation scheduling (HTGS); Moth-flame optimization (MFO); Solar energy; Wind energy","Constraint satisfaction problems; Cost reduction; Electric loads; Electric power transmission; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Hydroelectric power plants; Natural resources; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicle-to-grid; Virtual Power Plants; Wind power; Electric vehicle; Generation scheduling; Hydro-thermal scheduling; Hydro–thermal generation scheduling; Moth-flame optimization; Optimisations; Power; Renewable energy source; Scheduling problem; Thermal generation; Solar energy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198496783"

To address this gap, a hybrid cointegration–BiLSTM framework is proposed for medium- to long-term load forecasting. Cointegration theory is leveraged to identify long-term equilibrium relationships between EV charging capacity and socioeconomic factors, effectively mitigating spurious regression risks. The extracted cointegration features and error correction terms are integrated into a bidirectional LSTM network to capture complex temporal dependencies. Validation using data from 14 cities in Hunan Province demonstrated that cointegration analysis surpassed linear correlation methods in feature preprocessing effectiveness, while the proposed model achieved enhanced forecasting accuracy relative to conventional temporal convolutional networks, support vector machines, and gated recurrent units. Furthermore, a 49% reduction in MAE and RMSE was observed when ECT-enhanced features were adopted instead of unenhanced groups, confirming the critical role of comprehensive feature engineering. Compared with the GRU baseline, the BiLSTM model yielded a 26% decrease in MAE and a 24% decrease in RMSE.

Variations in charging power across different EV manufacturers lead to substantial load fluctuations at charging stations. In some tourist cities in China, charging loads can surge at specific times, yet existing research mainly focuses on optimizing station location and basic capacity configuration, neglecting sudden peak load management. To address this, we propose a method that enhances charging station carrying capacity (CSCC) by coordinating multi-flexibility resources. This method optimizes the configuration of soft open points (SOPs) to enable flexible interconnections between feeders and incorporates elastic load scheduling for data centers. An optimization model is developed to coordinate these flexible resources, thereby improving the CSCC. Case studies demonstrate that this approach effectively increases CSCC at lower costs, facilitates the utilization of renewable energy, and enhances the overall system economy. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, offering new insights for urban grid planning and EV charging stations optimization. © 2025 by the authors.","charging station carrying capacity (CSCC); data center; flexible resources; soft open points (SOPs)","Charging (batteries); Data centers; Electric power distribution; Optimization; Urban planning; Charging station; Charging station carrying capacity; Datacenter; Electric vehicle charging; Flexible resources; Power; Rapid growth; Safe operation; Soft open point; Vehicle pose; Charging stations","This research was funded by Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Power Grid Co., Ltd. grant number No. 050000KC23100012/YNKJXM20230376: \u201CResearch on key technologies of flexible resource planning and evaluation for new power system\u201D.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011515575"

This study focuses on formulating an empirical EV load model that characterises charging behaviour over a broad spectrum of supply voltage magnitudes to enable more accurate representation of EV demand under varying grid conditions. The empirical model is informed by laboratory evaluation of one Level 1 and two Level 2 chargers, along with five EV models. The testing revealed that all the chargers operated in a constant current (CC) mode across the applied voltage range, except for certain Level 2 chargers, which transitioned to constant power (CP) operation at voltages above 230 V. A model of a typical low voltage network has been developed using the OpenDSS software package (version 10.2.0.1) to evaluate the performance of the proposed empirical load model against traditional CP load modelling. In addition, a 24 h case study is presented to provide insights into the practical implications of increasing EV charging load. The results demonstrate that the CP model consistently overestimated network demand and voltage drops and failed to capture the voltage-dependent behaviour of EV charging in response to source voltage change. In contrast, the empirical model provided a more realistic reflection of network response, offering DNSPs improved accuracy for system planning. © 2025 by the authors.","conservation voltage reduction ratio; distribution network planning; electric vehicle load model; power quality; voltage regulation","Charging (batteries); Electric load distribution; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Power distribution planning; Power quality; Quality control; Voltage control; Voltage distribution measurement; Conservation voltage reduction ratio; Conservation voltage reductions; Distribution networks planning; Electric vehicle load model; Empirical model; Load modeling; Network service providers; Power; Reduction ratios; Vehicle load; Voltage regulators","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010343949"

First, to address the strong randomness and volatility of renewable energy, a prediction model for renewable energy output considering climatic conditions is established to characterize the output features of wind and solar power. Subsequently, a charging station model is constructed based on the behavioral characteristics of electric vehicle users. Then, an optimized carbon trading price mechanism incorporating the carbon price growth rate is introduced into the carbon emission cost accounting. Based on this, a joint planning model for the power and transportation systems is developed, aiming to minimize the total economic cost while accounting for renewable energy integration and electric vehicle charging station deployment.

This paper proposes a two-stage data-driven holistic optimization model for the siting and capacity allocation of charging stations. In the first stage, the location and number of charging piles are determined by analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of charging demand using ST-DBSCAN and K-means clustering methods. In the second stage, charging load results from the first stage, photovoltaic generation forecast, and electricity price are jointly considered to minimize the operator’s total cost determined by the capacity of PV and ESS, which is solved by the genetic algorithm. To validate the model, we leverage large-scale GPS trajectory data from electric taxis in Shenzhen as a data-driven source of spatiotemporal charging demand. The research results indicate that the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of different charging demands determine whether a charging station can become a PSCS and the optimal capacity of PV and battery within the station, rather than a fixed configuration.

Fast charging stations (FCSs), due to their high energy demand, further complicate grid operation, particularly in maintaining voltage stability and coordinating power supply. While previous studies often address DERs placement or control strategies in isolation, this study proposes a unified framework that optimizes both the placement and sizing of DERs in combination with advanced grid control mechanisms. The proposed approach uses a hybrid of three metaheuristic algorithms: Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The multi-objective formulation focuses on minimizing power loss and cost, improving voltage profiles, and reducing the L-index. A notable contribution of this work is the integration of Volt/Var and power factor (PF) management into the optimization process, which enables practical grid stabilization under steady-state conditions. The methodology is applied to the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and validated through simulation. Results indicate that the hybrid method performs better than traditional single-algorithm approaches, achieving significant power loss reductions and voltage improvements.

The goal of this research is to evaluate the investment drivers in solar energy communities with and without private vehicle electrification and its physical impact on the low-voltage distribution grid. The community investment decision is formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem, and a three-phase unbalanced power flow simulation analyses the impact of various community scenarios on a real Spanish distribution grid. The PV panel placement and sizing is driven by the minimal possible load-generation mismatch and the feed-in remuneration. Hence, accounting for electric vehicle distribution and charging strategies in the community planning phase affects the cost-optimal layout of PV systems. Going from uncontrolled electric vehicle charging with maximum power to a uniform charging strategy increases the viability in PV investments while significantly reducing the occurrence of excessive voltage drops. The occurrence of overvoltage from distributed solar generation more than doubles from 4.9% to 10.6% when increasing the PV penetration in the energy community by only 9% with an unfavourable panel distribution. Increasing the PV penetration by 59% with a more optimal panel allocation yields a comparatively lower occurrence of overvoltage of 10.0% highlighting the need for informed community planning. © 2025","Electric vehicle integration; Investment optimisation; Low-voltage distribution grid impact; Solar energy communities","DC distribution systems; Electrification; Energy management systems; Integer linear programming; Integer programming; Power distribution networks; Charging strategies; Community planning; Distribution grid; Electric vehicle integrations; Energy; Grid impacts; Investment optimization; Low-voltage distribution grid impact; Low-voltage distributions; Solar energy community; Electric power transmission networks","This work was supported by a grant of the Research Council of Norway (RCN), project number 351911 under COFUND-DUT-OPEN4CEC, \u2018Service-oriented Open Platform for Citizen Energy Communities (CEC) a collaborative platform\u2019.

However, existing studies primarily focus on individual network simulations, which are computationally intensive and lack scalability. Moreover, most research relies on synthetic network models rather than real-world distribution system operator (DSO) data, limiting practical applicability. This study addresses these gaps by developing a Reference Network Model (RNM) tailored to the Slovenian LV distribution system. The first objective is to establish reference radial network models based on real DSO data, enabling simulation generalization across the entire distribution network. Using k-medoids clustering, LV networks are categorized into representative groups, facilitating efficient analysis without exhaustive individual network simulations. The second objective is to develop a generalization methodology that extrapolates simulation results from reference networks to the entire LV distribution system. Unlike conventional RNM applications, this approach integrates real-world Slovenian DSO data and incorporates scenario-based reinforcement planning to address the evolving impact of DERs, EVs, and HPs. A key result is cost-benefit analysis, which evaluates investment requirements and operational savings, offering insights for policymakers and DSOs to optimize network planning.

Energy Storage Systems (ESS) play a critical role in mitigating fluctuations in RES output. This study evaluates the technical and economic effects of integrating RESs and ESSs into the power system under different scenarios. The first case examines the base system without RES/ESS (base case). The second case incorporates optimal capacitor placement. In the third case, RES units are introduced, followed by the integration of Electric Vehicle (EV) parking lots with optimal capacity determination in the fourth scenario. Three sub-scenarios assess the role of EV batteries, considering financial efficiency, RES output fluctuation smoothing, and load profile optimization. The findings highlight the positive impact of batteries across all cases. In the first scenario, EV batteries provide significant cost benefits for owners. In the second, they assist in managing RES penetration while mitigating adverse effects. The third scenario demonstrates improvements in power quality and grid stability, ensuring reliable power during peak demand and reducing dependence on the upstream network. Key contributions include the optimal placement and planning of capacitors, RES units, and EV parking lots in distribution systems, which reduce power loss costs and improve voltage profiles. The results indicate a 76 % reduction in the cost of power losses when using capacitors, RES units, and EVs compared to the base case. The cost of active power purchased from the upstream network decreases by approximately 24 % in the third case, with reductions of 0 % and 20 % in the second and third cases, respectively. For policymakers and industry practitioners, the study recommends prioritizing the strategic placement of ESS, RES, and EV infrastructure to enhance grid resilience and operational efficiency, as well as to optimize financial returns from RES integration. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Capacitor; Electrical vehicle; Energy storage; Optimal placement; Renewable energy","Battery storage; Capacitor storage; Cost benefit analysis; Hydroelectric power; Smart power grids; Virtual storage; Wind power integration; Electric vehicle batteries; Electrical vehicles; Energy; Optimal placements; Parking lots; Power; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Storage systems; Vehicle parking; Solar fuels","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003860684"

This forecasting model was validated through a comparison of the original 2022 historical data with the model-generated data for 2022. Next, the model-generated data for 2030 demand was used to increase the long-term forecasting accuracy by effectively capturing complex periodic seasonality and non-decreasing trends.

This study presents a mixed-integer programming model for the electric vehicle routing problem that considers soft time windows and linear weight-related discharging (EVRPSTW-LWD) and aims to minimize the overall cost.

To cope with the operational problems of IMGs in the presence of PEVs, this paper proposes a comprehensive market-based energy management system (EMS), called micro-market (μM), incorporating different participants and PEVs traffic flow. The proposed model considers both vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) modes with different traffic behavior of parking lots (PLs) and charging stations (CSs) in an IMG market environment (including uniform electricity pricing and unit commitment). Establishing a bidirectional linearized AC (BLAC) power flow enables the μM to efficiently schedule the joint active-reactive power of all participants and provide local energy trading conditions. Moreover, the developed μM schedules the cost of joint up/downward active-reactive reserve power effectively, ensuring the IMG will be operated securely. The suggested model is a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming (MILP), with the objective of maximizing social welfare (SW) for the upcoming day. The introduced model's efficacy is assessed by testing the μM in an IMG on the CIGRE medium-voltage benchmark, considering three different operational cases. The results reveal that incorporating PEVs traffic flow into the μM model increases SW by 3.7 %. However, adding battery degradation costs, while causing a 3 % reduction in the objective function, significantly enhances the model's practicality by meeting IMGs real-world operational requirements. Overall, the results verified the ability of the proposed model to address different operational challenges while the PEV owners' preferences are satisfied and secure operation is ensured. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Isolated microgrid; micro-market; Plug-in electric vehicles; Power and reserve scheduling; Traffic flow","Charging stations; Integer linear programming; Microgrids; Plug-in electric vehicles; Renewable energy; Stochastic models; Vehicle-to-grid; Isolated microgrid; Micro-markets; Microgrid; Plug-ins; Power; Power and reserve scheduling; Social welfare; Stochastics; Traffic flow; Vehicle traffic; Mixed-integer linear programming; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy management; energy market; linear programing; parking; smart grid; traffic congestion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000605640"

Despite the potential of EV loads offering emergency demand response (DR) for addressing such challenges, the willingness of EVs to respond to DR and the actual response quantity are uncertain. Furthermore, the uncertainty level in EV response varies along with DR incentive decisions, which further aggravates operation challenges. This paper proposes a resilient unit commitment (UC) model for EV-integrated power systems against extreme cold events. Specifically, first, we model how the temperature-sensitive EV charging loads change under extreme cold events considering the actual driving range and air conditioning load in EVs. Then, the inter-coupling relationship between uncertainties in EV response quantity and the DR incentive decisions is modeled. To overcome the limitations of conventional modeling approaches for decision-independent uncertainty, an affine function-based tractable model reformulation is presented addressing decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) in EV response. Subsequently, we establish the resilient UC model within a two-stage stochastic framework considering temperature-sensitive EV loads and DDU in EVs’ response behaviors.

However, the unpredictable nature of traffic conditions, charging prices, and waiting times at charging stations poses a significant challenge to achieving optimal EV navigation. In response to this challenge, a novel navigation system is proposed that strives to minimize both total travel time and charging costs at charging stations. The approach of this paper involves leveraging a unique methodology to determine the shortest path to the optimal charging station, which will be one of the renewable charging station, non-renewable charging station and mobile EV chargers, employing Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient route planning. The system takes into account real-time data on traffic dynamics, charging station availability, and pricing fluctuations to dynamically adjust navigation routes, ensuring that EV owners can make informed decisions on the go. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are conducted. The results demonstrate the system's ability to optimize both travel time and charging costs, providing a practical solution for EV navigation in the face of unpredictable variables.

Using an integrated planning model, the study analyzes the interaction between battery electric vehicle charging strategies and other flexibility options within the energy system. It compares three charging strategies – passive charging, flexible charging, and bi-directional Vehicle-to-Grid charging – which provide increasing levels of flexibility. The findings emphasize the cost-saving potential of flexible charging strategies. Flexible charging can reduce overall system costs by 7%, with the most significant savings and shifts seen in power generation. There is reduced investment in wind power, whereas investment in photovoltaic (solar) systems increases significantly compared to passive charging. Flexible charging improves solar energy's competitiveness over wind power by allowing peak solar generation to be absorbed as it occurs. There are also notable savings in fast-response options such as gas turbines, with 75% lower capacity investment in the scenario with the most flexible charging. In addition, investment in Power-to-X technologies, especially electrolyzers, is also lower due to more effective load shifting. Although flexible charging strategies may lead to challenging load peaks in the distribution grid, the study indicates that limiting the increase in load peaks to 60% can still result in a 6% reduction in overall system costs compared to passive charging. Our study results underpin that strategic charging management can facilitate the integration of renewable energy while lowering costs. © 2025 The Authors","Battery electric vehicles; Charging strategy; Flexibility; Renewable energy system; Sector coupling","State of charge; Battery-electric vehicles; Charging strategies; Energy systems; Flexibility; Integrated renewable energy systems; Power; Renewable energies; Renewable energy system; Sector coupling; System costs; Charging stations","This work was partially funded by the project COMPAMA from The Research Council of Norway, with grant number 314609.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000622033"

Also, this study integrates a dual-role EV parking lots, acting both as a consumer and electricity provider, and explores its potential to minimize costs while optimizing charging and discharging agendas.

This paper proposes a solution through the combined optimal allocation of wind-based distributed generators (DGs) and shunt capacitor banks (CBs). An artificial protozoa optimizer (APO) is introduced for the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generators (DGs) and combined batteries (CBs), complemented by network reconfiguration (NR). The primary objectives of this approach are to minimize active power loss, reactive power loss, and voltage deviations. Additionally, the impact of EV load penetration, ranging from 20% to 100%, is thoroughly analyzed, along with an assessment of its associated uncertainty. Various scenarios are tested on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system.

The thoughtful design and arrangement of charging stations, as a crucial component of the infrastructure supporting electric vehicles, is essential for the advancement of these kinds of vehicles. However, a number of intricate aspects, including policy economics, charging demand, user comfort when charging, and traffic circumstances, influence the design and arrangement of charging stations. With the goal to uncover competing interests and opportunities for collaboration in the operation and development of charging infrastructure, this study intends to assist researchers and technology developers in investigating cutting-edge techniques from the viewpoint of each constituent. Additionally, only a strong electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) infrastructure may provide some of the answers to the most basic EV concerns, like EV cost and range. The literature claims that several sorts of techniques, objective functions, and constraints for issue formulation have been used by the scholars. In addition, sensitivity analysis, vehicle to grid strategy, integration of distributed generation, charging kinds, objective functions, restrictions, EV load modelling, uncertainty, and optimization methodologies are examined for the most recent research publications.

A major component of this transition is the need for new supporting infrastructure: electric charging stations (CSs). HDEV CSs must be planned considering charging requirements, economic constraints, the rollout plan for HDEVs, and local utility grid conditions. Together, these considerations highly differentiate HDEV CS planning from light-duty CS planning. This paper addresses the challenges of HDEV CS planning by presenting a framework for determining the optimal sizing of multiple HDEV CSs using a multi-period expansion model. The framework uses historical data from depots and applies a mixed-approach optimization solver to determine the optimal sizes of two types of CSs: one that relies entirely on power generated by a PV system with local battery storage, and another that relies entirely on utility grid power supply. A two-layer uncertainty model is proposed to account for variations in PV power generation, HDEV arrival/departure times, and charger failures. The multi-period expansion strategy achieves up to a 78% reduction in total annual costs during the first deployment period, compared to fully expanded CSs. © 2025 by the authors.","charging station; electric vehicle; heavy-duty electric vehicle; multi-period sizing; optimization; uncertainty modeling","Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Expansion; Charging station; Charging station planning; Electric vehicle charging; Heavy duty; Heavy-duty electric vehicle; Multi-period; Multi-period sizing; Optimal sizing; Optimisations; Uncertainty models; Optimization","This work was supported by the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles, under Grant 69763 and Grant 45779.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008914575"

The case study in Shanghai reveals the overall curve and spatiotemporal distribution of EV charging load. The results show that the charging load can account for 7.8 % of Shanghai's total grid load, forming a spatial pattern of concentration in the central urban area and radiation towards the suburbs.

Unlike conventional two-stage robust optimization methods, our approach incorporates a resilience-driven formulation that explicitly accounts for severe renewable generation fluctuations, sudden demand variations, and unforeseen grid disturbances. The proposed model leverages a mixed-integer programming formulation, solved using a decomposition algorithm, to ensure computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The method optimally coordinates charging and discharging strategies for storage systems and electric vehicles, alongside flexible demand management, to minimize operational costs, startup/shutdown and no-load expenses, unserved load costs, and emissions. Simulations conducted on multiple test networks (6-bus, 24-bus, 118-node, and 300-node systems) validate the effectiveness of the approach. The results demonstrate optimal objective function values of $608,976 for the 6-bus network, $3399,185 for the 24-bus network, $21.58 million for the 118-node network, and $62.41 million for the 300-node network. Comparisons with established methods such as Benders decomposition and evolutionary algorithms reveal cost reductions of approximately 4.85 % and 9.47 % for the 6-bus network and 5.66 % and 9.15 % for the 24-bus network, respectively.

Most of the existing literature focuses on the operation of ECs, often with an implicit assumption about the capacities (i.e., ratings) and penetration levels of the DERs. However, there is a noticeable lack of emphasis on optimizing the planning and integration of DERs within these ECs. Considering the high cost of DERs, there is a need to optimally size DERs of ECs' participants that maximize the benefits, minimize the expenses of DER owners, and reduce the payback period. In this paper, a linear programming model is proposed for the optimal planning and operation of DERs installed in a residential EC in Spain, which includes photovoltaic (PV), battery energy storage (BES), and electric vehicles (EV). The objective is to minimize the EC's total annual costs, including investment, maintenance and operation (O&M), and operation costs (i.e., energy and contracted power costs). Furthermore, the proposed approach considers load demand, PV generation, electricity prices, and EVs arrival and departure uncertainties. The simulation results demonstrate that optimal planning reduces the annual costs by 10.95 % compared to the scenario without optimal PV and BES planning. Sensitivity analysis shows that, by decreasing the investment costs of BES by 30 %, increasing the electricity prices by 40 %, or decreasing the electricity selling price by 40 %, it could be feasible to install BES at part of the EC houses. There are no violations of the distribution network limits in all studied scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Several parameters are taken into account as part of this process, such as proximity to load centers, capacity of the power system, and traffic volume. The common charging station location distant from the load centers has been established to enhance the quality of power and reduce 5–10 % of distribution losses. Additionally, site location should also include the area land cost and this cost in the urban area is estimated to be about $500 to $2000 per square meter and other zoning regulations. In the design, the service radius of charging stations is also an important factor; Keeping the battery's DOD between 50 % and 70 % yields an estimated driving range of 150–200 km, which suggests a distance between stations of 50–70 km. In this case, the discount rate of 5 % can be adopted for O&M costs over the planning horizon of 20 years while the capital costs of provision of each station varies from $ 50,000 to $ 200,000 depending on the size of the station. The establishment of a large network for charging the EVs will enhance the power balance of the system thus reducing power losses whilst increasing the penetration of electric vehicles by integrating these numerical aspects together with technology and environmental considerations. © 2025 The Author(s)","Charging stations; Electric vehicle (EV); Infrastructure planning; Optimization; Power distribution networks","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000738372"

By leveraging this flow, we enhance demand estimation through a mapping function that provides more precise estimates of EV charging demand. Recognizing the uncertainties in charging demand, we formulate a multi-stage robust adaptive expansion model for EV charging stations to allow for adjustments as demand evolves. This model aims to maximize the total profit of charging station operators by determining the optimal number of charging piles across multiple stages. To solve this optimization problem, we design an algorithm based on the partition-and-bound method with finite adaptability to effectively balance computational efficiency with optimization performance.

In this study, resilience is integrated into the evaluation metrics for charging station layout planning, and a methodology for the layout of electric vehicle charging stations is proposed, balancing both economy and resilience. After constructing a typical extreme disaster scenario model using typhoons as an example, a resilience deployment model for charging stations is developed, which comprehensively considers the resilience of the distribution network and traffic flow. The objective function is designed to minimize the annual total social cost, which includes factors such as construction and operation costs, user usage costs, charging loss costs, and resilience configuration costs. A joint solution algorithm, combining the Voronoi diagram and particle swarm optimization algorithm, is proposed to solve the model. According to the simulation results of an illustrative example, the resilience optimization scenario performs well in terms of load loss penalty.

EVs offer substantial environmental benefits but pose challenges to power grids due to capacity constraints. To address these issues, a dual-layered deep learning method, combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is employed for precise EV load prediction. Additionally, a Hybrid Archimedes-Genetic (HAG) algorithm, integrating the Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), is proposed to optimize EVCS locations. This multi-objective approach aims to minimize active and reactive power losses while reducing the average voltage deviation index (AVDI). Two case studies were conducted using MATLAB and Python: the first predicted EV power demands, while the second identified optimal EVCS locations in IEEE 33-node and 69-node test systems. Results demonstrate that the HAG method outperforms GA, Particle Swarm Optimization, and AOA individually.

This study proposes a two-stage strategy for optimal placement and sizing of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and renewable distributed generators (DGs) in a coupled TN and distribution network (DN) by considering EV range anxiety. In the first stage, an integer particle swarm optimization algorithm and M1/M2/S queueing theory are used to find the best locations and sizes of EVCS while ensuring possible origin–destination round trips in a TN can be completed with a waiting time constraint. The objective function considered in this stage is maximizing EVCS operator profit. In the second stage, DN integrated with EVCS is used to obtain the ideal sites and sizes of renewable DGs. Modified Newton–Raphson load flow with a Q-PQV bus pair determines the ideal sites and sizes of renewable DGs while improving DN performance. A cost–benefit analysis is carried out to check whether DG planning is profitable. Hong’s 2 M+1 point estimate method incorporates the uncertainties related to EV behaviour and renewable sources. The validity of the proposed strategy is investigated using a coupled 33-bus DN with a 25-node TN system. The results reveal that considering EV range anxiety, the suggested approach effectively identifies the best locations and sizes for EVCS and renewable DGs beneficial for both EVCS and DN operators. Additionally, network reconfiguration increases the DN operator’s profit. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Electric vehicle charging stations; Hong’s 2 M+1 point estimate method; Network reconfiguration; Range anxiety; Renewable distributed generation","Cost benefit analysis; Integer programming; Charging station; Distributed generators; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Hong’s 2 M+1 point estimate method; Networks reconfiguration; Point-estimate methods; Range anxieties; Renewable distributed generations; Renewables; Queueing theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208950726"

The proposed framework consists of a bi-level optimization model, which comprises an upper-level problem and a lower-level problem. The upper-level problem addresses unit commitment (UC) in the transmission network, aiming to minimize operating costs and load shedding. It is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). Meanwhile, the lower-level problem focuses on the optimal operation of the distribution network, considering both renewable and non-renewable resources, as well as electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS). This problem is formulated as a linear model with the objectives of reducing power purchase costs from the transmission network and maximizing the utilization of renewable energy and EVCS charging power. The literature review highlights three main research gaps. Firstly, it is crucial to develop a convex model that ensures globally optimal solutions. Secondly, considering the problem-solving time, it is important to devise a method that can achieve globally optimal solutions in the shortest possible time, accounting for the dimensions, number of variables, and parameters involved in coordinating the transmission and distribution networks. Lastly, there is a need to develop a modeling approach that allows the integration of any number of distribution networks with the transmission network. To address these research gaps, we propose a solution methodology that involves rewriting the optimization problems using reformulation and decomposition methods. This approach enables the modeling of globally optimal solutions while ensuring faster solution times and the ability to incorporate numerous distribution networks into the transmission network. We validate the proposed model and methodology using various networks, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in coordinating the operation of transmission and smart distribution networks. The simulation results indicate that our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches. Specifically, the results show that the proposed approach effectively mitigates load interruptions in the distribution networks when renewable and non-renewable resources experience interruptions in each system. As a direct consequence, the vulnerability of the distribution networks has significantly diminished, showcasing the robustness and resilience of our approach to handling resource interruptions. Notably, the proposed approach is 40% faster than the KKT method and 20% faster than the evolutionary method, with approximately 8% more optimal results than the evolutionary method, demonstrating its superior coordination for integrated transmission and distribution networks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Bi-level stochastic optimization; Coordination of transmission and distribution network; Mixed integer linear programming; Renewable energy","Electric load shedding; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Integer programming; Network security; Operating costs; Optimal systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Bi-level stochastic optimization; Coordination of transmission and distribution network; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimal solutions; Renewable and non-renewable resources; Renewable energies; Stochastic optimizations; Transmission and distribution; Electric power distribution","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173928569"

Current research has primarily focused on optimal sizing methodologies for DGs and battery energy storage systems, predominantly utilizing constant load models. This approach fails to capture the dynamic and non-linear characteristics of actual load behaviour, which affects the voltage stability. The practical loads are composed of ZIP loads (Constant Impedance Load -CIL-‘Z’, Constant Current Load- CCL-‘I’ and Constant Power Load-CPL-‘P’). In this context, this research evaluates the effect of CCL and CPL modelling on the optimal sizing of system components, particularly in light of the growing prevalence of battery-operated loads. The study proposes an optimal system size designed to accommodate the diverse load demands represented by ZIP loads affecting system voltage across various applications, including residential, industrial, commercial, and agricultural settings. The analysis is conducted using the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization technique with consideration of a ±5% variation in the system’s rated voltage. The present study evaluated the minimum total annual cost over a twenty-year timeframe, utilizing actual site data. The results indicate a maximum number of system components in the agricultural load due to the dominating CPL.

This paper proposes a scalable simulation-based framework that combines deterministic nodal hosting capacity analysis with probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate and optimize DER integration in diverse feeder types. The methodology is demonstrated using the IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus test systems under full-year time-series simulations. Deterministic hosting capacity analysis shows that individual nodes can accommodate up to 76% of base load from PV sources, while Monte Carlo analysis reveals a network-wide average hosting capacity of 62%. Uncoordinated DER deployment leads to increased system losses, overvoltages, and thermal overloads. In contrast, coordinated integration achieves up to 38.7% reduction in power losses, 25% peak demand shaving, and voltage improvements from 0.928 p.u. to 0.971 p.u. Additionally, congestion-centric optimization reduces thermal overload indices by up to 65%. This framework aids utilities and policymakers in making informed decisions on DER planning by capturing both spatial and stochastic constraints. Its modular design allows for flexible adaptation across feeder scales and configurations. The results highlight the need for node-specific deployment strategies and probabilistic validation to ensure reliable, efficient DER integration.

However, for critical loads—such as hospitals or data centers—continuous power supply is of utmost importance. While distributed energy resources (DERs) within the network can supply power to some loads, outages may lead to compensation and fairness issues regarding the unsupplied loads. In response, this study proposes a methodology to determine the appropriate power contract price for key customers by estimating the unsupplied power demand for critical loads in isolated networks and incorporating both outage compensation costs and voltage stability penalties. The microgrid under consideration comprises DERs—including electric vehicles (EVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), photovoltaic (PV) plants, and wind turbine (WT) plants—as well as controllable resources such as battery energy storage systems (BESS) and hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS). It serves both residential load clusters and critical loads associated with social infrastructure. The proposed methodology is structured in two stages. In normal operating conditions, optimal scheduling is simulated using second-order conic programming (SOCP). In the event of a fault, mixed-integer SOCP (MISOCP) is employed to determine the optimal load shedding strategy. A case study is conducted using the IEEE 123 bus test node system to simulate the outage compensation cost calculation and voltage penalty assessment processes. Based on this analysis, a contract price for key customers that considers both disaster-induced outages and voltage impacts is presented. © 2025 by the authors.","compensation cost; disaster; key customer; microgrid; optimal pricing","assessment method; compensation system; demand-side management; disaster relief; energy storage; infrastructure planning; microgrid; pricing policy","This work was supported in part by Korea Electric Power Corporation (No. R24XO02-2) and in part by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant funded by the Korea government (MOTIE) (No. RS-2023-00234707).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006726672"

With more people driving electric cars, there will likely be a large increase in the power demand, which might put unprecedented strain on the distribution network. The effects of widespread EV integration on distribution network architecture are thoroughly examined in this paper. Electricity distribution networks face opportunities and obstacles as the number of electric vehicles (EVs) increases. The increased use of EVs is predicted to increase power demand, particularly during peak hours, which could pressure the infrastructure already in place, including feeders, substations, and transformers. This increasing demand may result in equipment overload, voltage drops, and higher system losses, requiring major network capacity and reliability upgrades. On the other hand, developments in demand response tactics and smart charging technology present viable remedies. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which enables EVs to return energy to the grid, and load shifting, which incentivizes charging during off-peak hours. Distribution networks can handle the expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) while reducing risks and guaranteeing system stability using technological innovation and strategic planning. ©2025.

Hence, one of the greatest issues faced by governments in the present day is to effectively control the escalating pace of climate change and achieve equilibrium since it directly impacts the future. The fate of the human race hinges on this matter. One of the contributors to the production of pollutants and global warming is the use of cars based on nonrenewable fuel. Consequently, most governments must eliminate fossil fuel vehicles and substitute them with electric vehicles (EV) as part of their short-term and long-term goals. However, the growing adoption of EVs has made it crucial for operators and network designers to strategically plan for electric power consumption, adapt the distribution network structure, and accurately determine the optimal number and positioning of charging stations. Thus, this paper utilizes a convex solution method based on integer linear programming to effectively plan the expansion of the distribution network considering the availability of EV charging stations, compensators, substations, resources, and new lines. This article aims to minimize the long-term expenses associated with constructing network infrastructure, subtransmission substations, EV charging stations, building sources, capacitor banks, and procuring power from the upstream network. The YALMIP toolbox in MATLAB software was utilized to model and solve the objective function of this problem, which is expressed in both deterministic and nondeterministic versions. The MOSEK solver was employed as the problem-solving tool. Three scenarios were implemented to plan the growth of the network on the 18-bus bus system.

Due to the charging and discharging characteristics of EVs, as well as their randomness and dispersion, it is feasible and challenging to introduce EV loads into the grid as a means of frequency regulation and peak shaving of the power system. In this paper, considering multi-subject distribution networks and the interaction of source–grid–load–storage with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), a density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm based on principal component analysis is employed to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of EV loads and identify the access status of EV charging stations and EV load status in each region in real time, as well as analyze the adjustable capacity and adjustable range of EV loads. Based on the adjustable capacity of the EV load, the optimization objectives include the maximum regulation of the EV load and the most economical operation cost. An accurate load regulation strategy based on automatic active control (APC) is proposed to reduce the maximum frequency deviation by 25% by integrating the load regulation of electric vehicles into the original AGC frequency regulation. At the same time, the feasibility of electric vehicles in peaking and standby scenarios is studied and verified through simulation cases, which can reduce the peak value of thermal power generation by 15% and 10% in the morning and evening. © 2025 by the authors.","APC; interactions; multi-agent; source–grid–load–storage; two-stage optimization","Advanced driver assistance systems; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Power distribution networks; APC; Charging characteristics; Frequency regulations; Intelligent transportation systems; Interaction; Load regulations; Multi agent; Source–grid–load–storage; Two stage optimizations; Vehicle load; Electric industry","This work was supported by the State Grid Corporation Science and Technology Project under Project 5400-202127384A-0-0-00.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004858306"

This study introduces a novel Coordinated Expansion Planning (CEP) model for efficiently deploying Electric Bike Urban Charging Stations (EB-UCSs) integrated with renewable energy sources, reactive power support devices, and grid reinforcement strategies. The proposed model utilizes a robust hybrid methodology combining Probability & Statistics (PS), Stochastic Programming (SP), and Chance-Constrained Programming (CCP) to effectively address uncertainties in EB demand behavior, conventional load demand, Distributed Generation (DG) power output, and Substation Capacity Optimization (SCO). By applying the model to both 54-bus and 123-bus test systems, the study evaluates the operational and economic performance of PDNs under deterministic and non-deterministic scenarios. Results reveal that integrating EB-UCSs within the PDN significantly reduces grid reinforcement costs and enhances system reliability and sustainability. In the 54-bus system, the CEP framework achieves cost reductions of 3.51 %, 5.21 %, and 4.69 % in deterministic (Case I and II) and non-deterministic conditions (Case IV) compared to the most challenging scenario (Case III). Similarly, in the 123-bus system, cost savings of 3.39 %, 9.71 %, and 4.17 % are observed for the same cases. Strategic placement of EB-UCSs near wind turbines (WTs) and capacitor banks (CBs) minimizes transmission losses and optimizes renewable energy utilization. Including these infrastructures also ensures voltage stability and reduces substation overloading, thereby fostering resilient and sustainable urban energy systems. Furthermore, the proposed classical mathematical approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of cost efficiency and computational time compared to metaheuristic algorithms, such as the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO). For instance, in the 123-bus system under Case IV, the classical approach achieves a computational time of 2.9 h, significantly lower than the 5.8–7.2 h required by metaheuristic methods. This highlights the scalability and practical feasibility of the proposed model for large-scale applications. The study's findings underscore the transformative potential of integrating EB-UCSs into PDNs. They offer a blueprint for policymakers and planners to design low-carbon, cost-effective, and resilient urban energy systems. The proposed CEP framework aligns with sustainable development goals by promoting renewable energy integration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and accelerating the adoption of electrified transportation systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Chance constraint; Coordinated expansion planning; Electric-bike; Personal light electric vehicles; Power distribution network; Robust model; Urban charging stations","Bus transportation; Charging stations; Constrained optimization; Constraint satisfaction problems; Depreciation; Dynamic programming; Electric bikes; Electric load distribution; Flow batteries; Health risks; HVDC power transmission; Hybrid vehicles; Integer programming; Light electric vehicles; Linear programming; Mass transportation; Maximum likelihood estimation; Microgrids; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Occupational risks; Overhead lines; Pareto principle; Passive solar; Power distribution networks; Power distribution planning; Public risks; Risk analysis; Solar fuels; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Structural optimization; Urban transportation; Vehicle-to-grid; Chance constraint; Charging station; Coordinated expansion planning; Expansion planning; Personal light electric vehicle; Power distribution network; Robust modeling; Urban charging station; Stochastic systems; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; greenhouse gas; heuristics; public transport; transportation system; urban transport","This research was financially supported by the Research Deputy of the University of Mohaghegh Ardabili under grant number 12498.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002124790"

To enhance the electric vehicle charging capacity of community power grids, this paper proposes a two-tier capacity allocation strategy for community microgrids in the context of power systems. The upper-level model allocates capacity with the objectives of highest MG reliability, minimum comprehensive operating cost and minimum carbon emission, while the lower-level model optimizes the scheduling strategy with the objectives of minimum weighted operating cost and minimum charging cost for EV users. First, the real-time price is used to guide the residents’ electricity consumption behavior to be more adaptive to the uncertainty of renewable energy sources and to ensure that the community MG has sufficient resilient capacity. Second, based on the alternative storage effect of EVs, EVs are integrated with storage batteries and participate in ancillary services. The results indicate that adopting the charging and discharging strategy can reduce the comprehensive operating cost by ¥3,673.575 while improving reliability by 1.925%. Although the carbon trading market increases the overall operating cost, it results in an additional 131.5 kW of renewable energy capacity.

The region assumes a significantly prominent status and fulfills a crucial role in China's energy security and power transition. This study concentrates on the low-carbon transition of the power system in West Inner Mongolia and examines pathways to accomplish the “carbon peak and neutrality” objectives. It emphasizes the significance of escalating electrification rates and the interplay between supply and demand in shaping future power systems. According to the future development direction of West Inner Mongolia and the load responsiveness characteristics, demand response (DR), Electric vehicles (EVs), and electric hydrogen production (EHP) are integrated into a planning model aimed at optimizing costs while ensuring operational safety. An analysis of the institutional framework and development trajectories for 2030 and 2060 is conducted, underscoring the pivotal role of demand-side flexibilities in the power system's transition. The research indicates that constructing a predominantly clean power supply system is essential for realizing the “carbon peak and neutrality” objectives, with energy storages and demand-side flexibilities playing crucial roles in regulating power surpluses and providing auxiliary services. Notably, EHP's extended energy storage capabilities effectively address seasonal imbalances in renewable energy output. The quantitative analysis indicates that the energy storage investment can be substantially reduced due to rapid advancements in DR and EHP, with a 5.3 % reduction when DR increases by 25 % and an 11.2 % reduction when EHP increases by 30 %.

However, this additional load on the distribution system can lead to significant challenges, including increased power losses and undervolage issues. Therefore, this paper proposes the optimized planning of electric vehicle charging stations, along with the integration of distributed energy resources considering the power system operator's perspective. The approach focuses on minimizing the costs associated with public charging stations and distributed generators, as well as reducing power losses and voltage deviation of the system. Additionally, this study incorporates both fast and slow chargers to address user requirements, while promoting the use of slow charging to help reduce the peak load demand caused by the electric vehicle charging stations. A novel variable pricing strategy for slow charging is also proposed to decrease the operator's expenses while promoting this mode of charging. The proposed methodology is validated through the integration of a 33-bus distribution test system with a 25-node traffic system. The analysis was conducted using three multi-objective optimization methods: Multi-Objective Cuckoo Search, Multi-Objective Flower Pollination Algorithm, and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. From the results, it is possible to conclude that the proposed approach provides benefits not only to the system operator but also to EV users, given the reduction in their travel costs.

However, the inherent intermittency of RESs presents significant challenges to power system stability, which are further exacerbated by the anticipated rise in electric vehicles (EVs), projected to exceed 130 million by 2030. To support this transformation, a robust energy infrastructure that integrates RESs, smart plug-in EV parking lots (PEV-PLs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and demand response programs (DRPs) is essential. This paper proposes a stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the optimal planning and operation of distribution systems (PDS) with increasing RES and EV penetration. The model incorporates wind and photovoltaic (PV) distributed generators (DGs), PEV-PLs, fixed and mobile battery energy storage systems (FBESSs and MBESSs), and DRPs. It optimally determines the sizing and placement of key components while strategically managing the relocation of MBESSs to minimize economic costs (investment, maintenance, and operation), environmental impacts (carbon emissions from the PDS), power losses, and voltage deviations. The model also accounts for major uncertainties, including EV charging behavior, wind speed, solar irradiation, load demand, and energy price fluctuations. The proposed framework is validated using the IEEE 69-bus test system, with nine configurations evaluated, ranging from a baseline (Case 1) to a fully integrated setup (Case 9). These cases include various combinations of RESs, PEV-PLs, FBESSs, MBESSs, and DRPs. The analysis underscores the importance of coordinated integration of RESs, storage, and DRPs to achieve environmental and operational benefits. Among the evaluated configurations, Case 7, which includes RESs, PEV-PLs, MBESSs, and DRP, emerges as the most balanced solution, achieving the lowest emission cost ($323,516.65/year), the highest loss reduction (39.60%), and the greatest voltage deviation improvement (41.14%). Case 3 excels in reducing operational costs (35.66%) and achieving the highest RES penetration (2.65 MVA), demonstrating the benefits of combining wind-PV DGs with a moderate EV fleet. In contrast, Case 9, despite incorporating the highest EV penetration (179 EVs) and the most comprehensive mix of technologies, underperforms economically due to system complexity, with only a 16.54% reduction in operational costs and a 1.23% increase in total cost. Overall, the results indicate that configurations that balance RES integration with moderate EV deployment and strategic energy storage, such as Cases 3 and 7, offer the most effective trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives. © 2025 The Author(s)","Demand response programs; Fixed and mobile batteries; Plug-in electric vehicles parking lots; Power distribution system planning; Renewable energy sources; Stochastic optimization","Battery storage; Dynamic programming; Frequency stability; Global optimization; Hydroelectric power; Integer programming; Linear programming; Particulate emissions; Passive solar; Solar fuels; Stochastic programming; Surface water resources; Virtual storage; Wind power integration; Windmill; Demand response programs; Fixed and mobile battery; Parking lots; Plug-in electric vehicle parking lot; Plug-ins; Power distribution system planning; Renewable energy source; Stochastic optimizations; Uncertainty; Vehicle parking; Plug-in electric vehicles","This work was supported by UNITEN through Postdoctoral Fellowships under project code J510050002, Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia through Fundamental Research Grant (FRGS) under project code FRGS/1/2020/TK0/UNITEN/02/2.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004411306"

Dynamic thermal rating (DTR), which evaluates the equipment rating based on actual meteorological conditions and equipment thermal state, can enhance the equipment transfer capability to meet the increasing load demand. In this paper, we propose a model considering the active response of EVs, and a bi-level DNP model incorporating the DTR of cables and transformers, in the upper level, the Prim algorithm is embedded into the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm to obtain an initial grid topology; in the lower level, types of cables and transformers as well as the installation of DTR equipment are determined, second-order cone (SOC) relaxation and linearisation of the variables product are then carried out to meet the non-linear constraints of cables and transformers, and the upper and lower models are solved in an iterative manner. Case studies demonstrate that the implementation of DTR effectively enhances the transfer capability of cables and transformers, saving 4.8% investment cost while ensuring 96% uplift of power supply.

This study explores strategies to improve power generation and voltage stability in distribution networks by integrating EVCS with distributed solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems. To minimize power losses and identify the optimal placement of EVCS in IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems, Evolutionary Programming (EP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) are three optimization techniques that have been compared. To reduce the dependency on the grid and accommodate additional charging demand, the EVCS is being integrated with PV systems. The results demonstrate that GWO outperforms PSO and EP.

This paper proposes a spatio-temporal adaptive voltage coordination control strategy involving multiple timescales and multi-device collaboration. Aiming at the heavy workload caused by the continuous sampling of real-time data in the whole domain, an intra-day innovative construction of intra-day minute-level optimization and real-time adaptive control double-layer control mode are introduced. Intra-day minute-level refinement of on-load tap changer (OLTC) and step voltage regulator (SVR) day-ahead scheduling plans to fully utilize OLTC and SVR voltage regulation capabilities and improve voltage quality is discussed. In real-time adaptive control, a regional autonomy mechanism based on the functional area voltage quality risk prognostication coefficient (VQRPC) is innovatively proposed, where each functional area intelligently selects the time period for real-time voltage regulation of distributed battery energy storage systems (DESSs) based on VQRPC value, in order to improve real-time voltage quality while reducing the data sampling workload. Aiming at the state of charge (SOC) management of DESS, a novel functional area DESS available capacity management mechanism is proposed to coordinate DESS output and improve SOC homogenization through dynamically updated power–capacity availability (PCA). And vine model threshold band (VMTB) and deviation optimization management (DOM) strategies based on functional area are innovatively proposed, where DOM optimizes DESS output through the VMTB to achieve voltage fluctuation suppression while optimizing DESS available capacity. Finally, the DESS and electric vehicle (EV) cooperative voltage regulation mechanism is constructed to optimize DESS capacity allocation, and the black-winged kite algorithm (BKA) is used to manage DESS output. The results of a simulation on a modified IEEE 33 system show that the proposed strategy reduces the voltage fluctuation rate of each functional area by an average of 36.49%, reduces the amount of data collection by an average of 68.31%, and increases the available capacity of DESS by 5.8%, under the premise of a 100% voltage qualification rate. © 2025 by the authors.","adaptive voltage regulation; distributed photovoltaics; distribution network; functional area; state of charge (SOC)","Model reference adaptive control; Quality management; Resource allocation; Risk management; Self adjusting control systems; Strategic planning; Adaptive voltage; Adaptive voltage regulation; Available capacity; Battery energy storage systems; Distributed photovoltaic; Functional areas; Photovoltaics; State of charge; States of charges; Voltage quality; Information management","This research was funded by The Key Science and Technology Program of Henan Province grant number [No. 252102240060].","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003761774"

For an extended period, vehicles on the road will consist of a mix of traditional gasoline and electric vehicles. To explore the economic driving strategies for diverse vehicles on the road, this paper introduces a collaborative eco-driving system that takes into account the energy consumption traits of vehicles. Unlike prior research, this paper puts forward a lane change decision-making approach that integrates energy modeling and speed prediction. This method can effectively capture the speed variations in the vehicle ahead and facilitate lane changes with energy efficiency in mind. The system encompasses three vital functions: vehicle cooperative architecture, ecological trajectory planning, and power system control. Specifically, eco-speed planning is carried out in two stages: the initial stage is executed globally, with cooperative speed optimization performed based on the energy consumption characteristics of different vehicles to determine the economical speed for vehicle platoon driving. The subsequent stage involves local speed adaptation, where the vehicle platoon dynamically adjusts its speed and makes lane change decisions according to local driving conditions. Ultimately, the generated control information is fed into the powertrain control system to regulate the vehicle. To assess the proposed collaborative eco-driving system, the algorithms were tested on highways, and the results substantiated the system’s efficacy in reducing the energy consumption of vehicle driving. © 2025 by the authors.","collaborative eco-driving system; ecological trajectory planning; energy consumption characterization","Traffic control; Co-operative planning; Collaborative eco-driving system; Driving systems; Eco-driving; Ecological trajectory planning; Energy consumption characterization; Energy-consumption; Lane change; Trajectory Planning; Vehicle platoons; Electric power system control","This research was funded by [the National Natural Science Foundation of China] grant number [52272367].","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003679282"

The rising penetration of EVs intensifies interdependencies between urban transport and electric power systems through charging infrastructures. This study presents a novel hybrid energy system that integrates renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic and wind turbines, conventional diesel generators, battery storage, and distribution grids to reliably satisfy the charging demands of electric vehicles in urban environments. A Hybrid Grey Wolf Cuckoo Search Algorithm (HGWCSA), which synergistically combines the exploitation capabilities of Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and the exploration strengths of Cuckoo Search (CS), is employed to optimize the system's sizing and operational performance of the charging system. The primary advantages of HGWCSA include faster convergence, superior solution accuracy, and robust capability to avoid local optima. The effectiveness and innovation of HGWCSA are validated through comparative performance assessments against conventional metaheuristic algorithms. The study further contributes novel insights by thoroughly assessing techno-economic feasibility, socio-economic opportunities, strategic policies, and implementation challenges within the context of sustainable e-mobility from a case study perspective in the Arabian Peninsula. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate that the HGWCSA achieves the lowest Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) at $0.08/kWh and the minimum Total net present cost (TNPC) of $103,267, significantly reducing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions compared to traditional optimization methods.

This topic is of significant interest to utility power systems where distributed intermittent energy sources will increase significantly and be relied on for electric grid ancillary services. Previous work on MPCs has focused on narrowly targeted control applications such as improving electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure or reducing the cost of integrating Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) into the grid. In contrast, this article develops a comprehensive treatment of the construction of an MPC tailored to electric grids and then applies it integration of intermittent energy resources. To accomplish this, the following article includes a description of a reduced order model (ROM) of an electric power grid based on a circuit model, an optimization formulation that describes the MPC, a collocation method for solving linear time-dependent differential algebraic equations (DAEs) that result from the ROM, and an overall strategy for iteratively refining the behavior of the MPC. Next, the algorithm is validated using two separate numerical experiments. First, the algorithm is compared to an existing MPC code and the results are verified by a numerically precise simulation. It is shown that this algorithm produces a control comparable to existing algorithms and the behavior of the control carefully respects the bounds specified. Second, the MPC is applied to a small nine bus system that contains a mix of turbine-spinning-machine-based and intermittent generation in order to demonstrate the algorithm’s utility for resource planning and control of intermittent resources. This study demonstrates how the MPC can be tuned to change the behavior of the control, which can then assist with the integration of intermittent resources into the grid. The emphasis throughout the paper is to provide systematic treatment of the topic and produce a novel nonlinear control compatible design framework applicable to electric grids and the control of variable resources. This differs from the more targeted application-based focus in most presentations. © 2025 by the authors.","microgrid; model predictive control; optimal control; orthogonal spline collocation; power grid; pseudospectral method","Electrometallurgy; Geophysical prospecting; Invariance; ROM; Surface waters; Electric grids; Energy; Microgrid; Model-predictive control; Optimal controls; Orthogonal spline collocation; Orthogonal splines; Power grids; Pseudospectral methods; Spline collocation; Predictive control systems","Funding text 1: Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-mission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC (NTESS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) under contract DE-NA0003525.

The increasing integration of renewable resources, such as solar and wind power, along with the rising adoption of EVs, underscores the need for robust strategies to optimize their incorporation into power systems. This study proposes a strategic, long-term planning optimization framework for the effective integration of green energy technologies. The framework emphasizes the optimal deployment of wind and photovoltaic (PV) distributed generators (DGs) for RESs and the establishment of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging infrastructure within distribution systems (DS). Furthermore, stationary battery energy storage systems (SBESSs) are integrated to enhance the penetration of RESs and EVs. The proposed framework determines optimal locations, sizes, and operational strategies for RESs, PEV infrastructure, and SBESSs while addressing technical, operational, and economic constraints. It accounts for uncertainties such as renewable generation variability, energy prices, electricity demand, and EV energy and time dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) and the backward reduction method (BRM) are employed to analyse various scenarios and ensure computational efficiency. Additionally, a coordinated charging and discharging control mechanism for SBESSs and EVs is developed to manage active and reactive power, thereby improving overall system performance. The framework simultaneously minimizes three objectives: long-term planning and operation cost, total power loss, and voltage deviation. Advanced optimization algorithms, including the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), are utilized to achieve these goals. The methodology is validated on a 69-bus system under four distinct configurations. Results indicate that the integration of wind, PV, PEV infrastructure, and SBESSs significantly enhances green energy penetration and system efficiency compared to other configurations. For instance, the integration of RESs and PEVs increases RES penetration from 3.35 MVA to 3.80 MVA with an optimal EV fleet size of 249 vehicles, achieving a 2.14 % reduction in total cost, albeit with a 6.33 % increase in power loss and a 2.03 % rise in voltage deviation compared to the RES-only scenario. The addition of SBESSs further improves RES penetration to 3.90 MVA, reduces costs by an additional 0.88 %, and mitigates power loss and voltage deviation by 13.36 % and 9.80 %, respectively, though it reduces the EV fleet size from 249 to 168 vehicles. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework in optimizing green energy integration and advancing sustainable energy systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Charging-discharging control strategy; Long-term planning model; Plug-in electric vehicles parking lots (PEV-PL); Renewable energy sources (RESs); Stationary battery energy storage systems (SBESSs); Uncertainties","Associative storage; Battery storage; Fleet operations; Overhead lines; Phosphate deposits; Solar energy; Solid-State Batteries; Stochastic programming; Voltage scaling; Wind power; Wind power integration; Battery energy storage systems; Charging-discharging control strategy; Charging/discharging; Control strategies; Long term planning; Long-term planning model; Parking lots; Planning models; Plug-in electric vehicle parking lot; Plug-ins; Renewable energy source; Stationary batteries; Stationary battery energy storage system; Uncertainty; Vehicle parking; Plug-in electric vehicles","This work was supported by UNITEN through Postdoctoral Fellowships under project code J510050002 , Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia through Fundamental Research Grant (FRGS) under project code FRGS/1/2020/TK0/UNITEN/02/2 , and the Strategic Research Program under the Emirates Center for Mobility Research (ECMR) , UAE University (project title: \u201CDual Horizon EV Charging Station Planning Incorporating Multi-Level Charging Strategy and Renewable Energy Resources\u201D) under Grant G00004645 .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217088613"

For this aim, a two-stage approach is proposed in this paper focusing on minimizing costs, total losses, total harmonic distortion (THD), and greenhouse gas emissions.

However, it is often questionable in practice because of users' random and short-duration charging behavior, originating from refueling petrol vehicles. This paper proposes to guide users to charge EVs in a grid-friendly way by service mode design. We established a workplace solar charging system to provide intermittent but free charging services for employees. A year-round field experiment with typical private EV users in Beijing was conducted to demonstrate the system performance and the impact on charging behavior. Charging energy was sourced solely from rooftop photovoltaics without energy storage, covering 96.1 % of their commuting travel demand. The users developed a habit of “plugging in upon parking and keeping connected until leaving”. The mean plug-in duration increased from 2.0 h to 9.4 h (approximately the daily working hours), providing more opportunities for flexible regulation. Furthermore, the users became willing to arrive and leave with lower state-of-charge (averagely 50.3 % and 79.1 %), indicating relief of range anxiety and deceleration of battery degradation. This study provides real-world evidence for the transition of charging behavior guided by the charging service mode, which benefits EV users and contributes to grid decarbonization. © 2024","Charging behavior; Charging infrastructure; Electric vehicle (EV); Energy flexibility; Microgrid; Photovoltaics (PV)","Charging stations; Charging behavior; Charging infrastructures; Electric vehicle; Energy flexibility; Field experiment; Microgrid; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaics; Service mode; Solar charging; State of charge; demand analysis; electric vehicle; infrastructure planning; parking; photovoltaic system; smart grid; workplace; Beijing [China]; China","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2023YFC3807002), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52208112), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology (2023QNRC001), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M701935), and Tsinghua University - Architectural Design and Research Institute Joint Research Center for Synergy and Wisdom Creation of Architecture.

As EV adoption grows, charging demand—particularly during peak hours in cities—may place significant pressure on the electrical grid. Charging at high power, especially during the evening when most EVs are parked in residential areas, can lead to grid instability and increased costs. One promising solution is to leverage long-duration, low-power charging, which can align with typical user behavior and improve grid compatibility. This paper delves into how public slow charging stations (<7.4 kW) in metropolitan residential areas can alleviate grid pressures while fostering a host of additional benefits. We show that, with respect to a reference (22 kW infrastructure), such stations can increase EV user satisfaction by up to 20%, decrease grid costs by 40% owing to a peak load reduction of 10 to 55%, and provide six times the flexibility for energy markets. Cities can overcome the limitation of private garage scarcity with this charging approach, thus fostering the transition to EVs. © 2025 by the authors.","distribution network; electric vehicles; network planning; slow charging; smart charging; urban planning; V1G","State of charge; Electric power; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Grid integration; Metropolitan area; Network planning; Public electric vehicle; Residential areas; Slow charging; Smart charging; V1G; Charging stations","This research was partially carried out within the NEST\u2014Network 4 Energy Sustainable Transition (D.D. n. 1561 dell\u201911.10.2022, CUP D43C22003090001, PE0000021) and funded by the Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR), Mission 4 Component 2 Investment 1.3, funded by the European Union\u2014NextGenerationEU.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001391984"

Existing methods primarily focus on a long-term perspective (e.g., system planning), and consider the EV charging demands as scalar values, which introduces inaccuracies in real-time operations due to the inherently stochastic nature of EVs. In this regard, this paper proposes a real-time HC assessment method for EVs through a three-step process, involving real-time probabilistic forecasting, risk analysis and probabilistic optimization. Specifically, we conduct real-time probabilistic forecasting to capture the stochastic nature of EV charging demands across multiple charging stations by performing deterministic forecasting and fitting the distribution of forecasting errors. The deterministic forecasting is conducted using an adaptive spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN). ASTGCN leverages adaptive spatial feature extraction, attention-based temporal feature extraction, and second-order graph representation to improve the forecasting performance. Subsequently, based on the probabilistic forecasting of EV charging demands, we conduct real-time risk analysis and operational boundary identification by utilizing probabilistic power flow calculations to assess potential violations of secure operational constraints. Furthermore, we present the formulation of real-time HC of EVs considering expected satisfaction of stochastic EV charging demands, and propose an optimization model for real-time HC assessment of EVs. Numerical experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed ASTGCN model outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models by achieving the lowest root mean square error of 0.0442, and the real-time HC is improved by 64% compared to long-term HC assessment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive spatio-temporal graph neural network; Electric vehicle; Hosting capacity; Probabilistic forecasting; Risk analysis","Risk assessment; Adaptive spatio-temporal graph neural network; Capacity assessment; Charging demands; Electric vehicle charging; Graph neural networks; Hosting capacity; Probabilistic forecasting; Real- time; Risk analyze; Spatio-temporal graphs; Risk analysis; artificial neural network; assessment method; electric vehicle; optimization; probability; real time; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis","This work was supported in part by Special Foundation of Jiangsu Province Innovation Support Program (Soft Science Research) under Grant (No. BE2023093-1 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (No. 52307144 ), the special funding from China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2023TQ0169 ), and the Project ( SKLD24KZ04 ) supported by State Key Laboratory of Power System Operation and Control .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211751041"

These concerns are expected to grow as electrification expands to incorporate heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses due to their greater energy requirements and higher charging loads. Two strategies are proposed to support medium- and heavy-duty chargers which address their high power demand and mitigate power quality disturbances and the overloading of substations. The first is a dedicated feeder connected at the secondary of the substation directly to the charging station which aims to reduce the impact of high load on other customers. The second is the addition of a dedicated substation that solely provides power for charging stations in major corridors, alleviating stress on existing zone substations. Hosting capacity is measured using a voltage deviation index, describing the deviation in line voltage, which should experience a sag of no more than 6% of the nominal voltage, and a substation charging capacity index, describing the available capacity of each zone substation as a ratio of its total power capacity. Verification of the proposed strategies was performed on an MV-LV distribution network representative of an industrial Australian town with heavy-vehicle charging. Results showed that the network could handle ten 250 kW chargers, which was tripled to 35 with a dedicated feeder. The dedicated feeder alternatively allowed up to 10 megawatt-scale chargers, which was again tripled when a dedicated substation was introduced. © 2025 by the authors.","demand-side management; distributed generation; distribution system reconfiguration; electric vehicles","Automobiles; Demand side management; Electric utilities; Electrification; Power distribution planning; Rectifier substations; Charging station; Demand-side; Distribution system reconfiguration; Electric truck; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Heavier vehicles; Heavy duty; Power; Transport sectors; Voltage deviations; Trucks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218622415"

Firstly, this paper establishes a charging pile day-ahead dispatchable prediction model and a real-time dispatchable potential assessment model through Monte Carlo sampling simulation. It replaces the traditional energy storage model with this model and then solves the EV and SOP collaborative planning model using a second-order conical planning algorithm with the objective function of minimizing the annual integrated cost. At the same time, the flexibility of the distribution network is analyzed by two indicators: power supply and demand balance and branch load margin.

Traditional power system management methods cannot cope with dynamic real-time changes, and it is difficult to effectively predict and respond to potential failures caused by extreme weather. To this end, this paper proposes a real-time power system optimization method based on the Smart “Predict, then Optimize” (SPO) framework. The SPO method first uses the Transformer model to predict, in real time, the future line damage states and then dynamically adjusts the optimization strategy based on the prediction results. This method can efficaciously enhance the prediction accuracy of faulty lines under extreme weather conditions and optimize generation scheduling, load management, as well as EV battery scheduling to minimize the system cost. This study proposes a solution based on the SPO loss function, artificial intelligence prediction model, and bi-level optimization model to address the dynamic optimization of power systems under extreme conditions, significantly enhancing the system’s response to extreme weather events. The experimental results demonstrate that the SPO method can optimize system operation in real time, significantly reducing load shedding and total system cost during typhoon weather, which not only improves the system’s economic efficiency but also effectively enhances power system resilience. © 2025 by the authors.","extreme weather; optimization; SPO; system resilience; transformer","Extreme weather; Extreme weather events; Optimisations; Power; Power systems optimizations; Real- time; Real-time power system; Smart “predict, then optimize”; System resiliences; Transformer; Weather forecasting","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217577152"

However, this rise in EV numbers impacts distribution networks, affecting energy loss, bus voltage, grid stability, reliability, and harmonic distortion due to charging requirements. The increased peak demand on the grid from charging stations (CSs) poses a significant challenge. The location and capacity of CSs are influenced by investor decisions and EV user behavior. A multi-objective problem is formulated, considering the installation cost of charging infrastructure, energy loss in the electrical network, and EV users’ travel costs for charging. To mitigate grid demand, photovoltaic (PV) sources are proposed at distribution network nodes with CSs. Energy management strategies (EMSs) are implemented to efficiently control the discharging and charging of battery energy storage systems (BESS), aiming to minimize peak power demand and optimize PV source utilization. The proposed solution is tested on the IEEE-33 distribution network, with simulations running over 24 h. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique addresses uncertainties in PV generation and EV charging needs. Results show that incorporating EMSs at optimal CS locations reduces average energy loss by up to 15% and peak power demand from the grid by up to 20%.

It is specifically challenging with the increased integration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar, due to the uncertainty behavior in power systems. In this paper, with the aim of reducing cost, increasing welfare of consumer and increasing revenue of Load Serving Entities (LSEs), a GEP structure is introduced which is described these challenges using a fuzzy wavelet-based approach. This structure contains an advanced Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network (FWNN) to model uncertainties in renewable production, permitting for more accurate and adaptive decision-making below variable situations. Additionally, a real-time pricing mechanism managed by LSEs is implemented, which regulates prices for flexible electric loads considering current demand, encouraging consumers to shift their energy demand response to price changes. This method not only supports grid stability but also supplies economic motivations for consumers with providing flexible loads area, while inflexible electric and heat loads continue to function at retail market taxes. To analyze the efficiency of our model, two scenarios is considered as follow: in the first, consumers contribute in the demand response program, leading to higher LSE revenue (by 26 %) and lower consumer payments (by 10 %) compared to the second scenario, where consumers do not contribute and all loads follow retail market pricing. The welfare in the first scenario is slightly reduced by 5.9 %, reflecting the trade-off between cost savings and flexible load alterations. These results, subsequent through a GAMS-based optimization, prove the proposed framework's ability to improve grid resilience, decrease costs, and expand renewable integration, offering economic and operational profits for both LSEs and consumers. © 2024","Flexible and inflexible electric loads; Fuzzy wavelet neural network; Fuzzy-probabilistic model; Generation expansion planning; Load serving entity; Renewable energy","Earnings; Fuzzy inference; Taxation; Flexible and inflexible electric load; Flexible loads; Fuzzy wavelet neural network; Fuzzy-probabilistic model; Generation expansion planning; Load serving entities; Probabilistic models; Real time pricing; Renewable energies; Retail market; Demand response; alternative energy; artificial neural network; electric vehicle; energy planning; environmental effect; fuzzy mathematics; market conditions","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, under Grant No. 62203401; and the Scientific and Technological Research Foundation of Henan Province (No. 232102241043).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210615769"

The day-ahead model determines optimal initial energy scheduling, while the balancing model optimizes energy and reserve products for three market designs with varying Transmission and Distribution System Operators’ coordination. The framework is applied to the interconnected Greek-Bulgarian-Romanian power system, considering 2030 installed capacities. The model outputs illustrate market coupling scenarios among Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece, highlighting clear price signals and distributed energy resources flexibility. Results reveal the significance of a diverse energy mix for energy security and show that Transmission and Distribution System Operators’ coordination significantly influences ancillary service prices, with reductions of up to 80 % in certain scenarios. Net demand values determine electricity flow direction. Flexibility providers like storage can cover up to 100 % of the upward congestion management requirements and 11 % of upward balancing energy, helping smooth energy allocation from intermittent renewables. The impact of electric vehicle penetration on generation scheduling is minimal. The proposed model offers valuable insights for system operators, market participants, and policymakers, enabling them to provide accurate price signals and optimize resource allocation. The integrated day-ahead and balancing market models support efficient renewable energy integration, emissions reduction, enhanced grid stability, and investment in low-carbon technologies.

However, it should be remembered that in highly urbanized environments, it is not always possible to install them in sites, mainly for fire safety reasons. As an alternative solution, the supply of electricity through mobile electricity storage facilities (MESF) can be used. Therefore, this article proposes the concept of custom electric vehicles (CEV) carrying additional battery packs with specified capacities. CEVs were divided into three categories, depending on the size of such a vehicle. In the main part of the research, optimization of the capacity of batteries acting as MESF was performed, taking into account constraints related to the vehicle's payload, the cost of batteries and the feasibility of energy services. These services were provided for a designated urban area, in which CEVs provided backup power supply services and optimization of the self-consumption rate. The results indicate that CEVs with a battery capacity of about 100 kWh should be built for vehicles with a payload of up to 700 kg. For vehicles with a payload of up to 1000 kg and a gross vehicle weight of no more than 3.5 t, mobile energy storage facilities will have a capacity of about 150 kWh, while for heavy-duty vehicles the results indicate the installation of MESFs with a capacity of 800 kWh. A major limitation, however, proved to be the cost of batteries for MESFs, which is assumed not to exceed the cost of purchasing a vehicle. Taking into account the aforementioned capacities, it is possible to provide enough electricity to partially balance urban consumers using CEVs with additional battery packs. © 2024 The Authors","Battery energy storage systems; Electric vehicles; Flexibility services; Mobile electricity storage facilities; Smart grid","Battery storage; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery energy storage systems; Battery pack; Electricity storages; Energy; Energy services; Flexibility service; Mobile electricity storage facility; Smart grid; Storage facilities; Urban areas; Battery Pack","The authors would like to thank the Warsaw City Hall for providing the necessary data and support for this research.

In modern electric power systems, the integration of EVCS and DG must be carefully planned. Inappropriate sizing and location of EVCS can cause network overload, increase power losses, and allow for voltage variations outside the standard. This study adopts a reference distribution network that is representative of a typical business distribution network in a metropolitan city in Indonesia. To resolve the issue of determining the size and location of EVCS, the hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm algorithm (HGAMSSA) optimization method with multi-objective function is implemented. There are three scenarios used when determining the size and placement of EVCS. In the first scenario, the EVCS comprises chargers at levels 1, 2, and 3, with DG integration. In the second scenario, EVCS is comprised of level 2 and level 3, with DG integration. While in the third scenario, EVCS only consists of level 3 chargers with DG integration. The simulation results indicate that network utilization can be optimized at 79.00%, 75.53%, and 76.37% when electric cars (EV) operate in grid to vehicle (G2V) mode, compared to a base load of 29.46%. In vehicle to grid (V2G) mode, the energy supplied by the electric vehicle (EV) via the EVCS is 0.91 MWh. Additionally, the distribution network receives 10.036 MWh of electricity from rooftop photovoltaic (PV). © 2025 The Authors. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The integration of solar energy has increased to meet this increased demand. Hence, due to the inappropriate integration of Solar-based Distributed Generations, the system gets unbalanced with increased losses, voltage profile imbalance, poor fault tolerance capability, and reliability issues. Also, it is impossible to fulfill the increased reactive power demand of the Distribution Network by these DGs. Therefore, in this work, to address these issues, the appropriate planning of hybrid Solar-DG Integrated DSTATCOM in a reconfigured DN with Exponential Load Model (ExpLM), including EV Charging Station load impacts, is presented considering the Sustainable Development Goals: Techno-Enviro-Economic challenges. The presented work's effectiveness is established on a modernized practical 33-bus DN using APSO, GWO-PSO, TLBO, and HBA by optimizing the TEE parameters. The considered techno parameters of the DN are Active Power Loss, Reactive Power Loss, Voltage Deviation, Level of Line Fault Current, and Service Reliability, which makes up the Multiple-Objective Fitness Problem. Similarly, the economic and enviro performance parameters are the Cost for Slack Bus Generation, Cost for Fixed Capital Recovery, Cost for Energy Lost, Cost for Energy Not Supplied, Total Cost, Cost for Solar-DG Integrated DSTATCOM, Saving Cost, Pay Back Period, and Environmental Particle Emission.

This study focuses on strategic expansion planning, incorporating the optimal placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and port numbers in an overlapped road and distribution network. It also addresses the replacement of branch conductors to prevent network overloads, along with optimal scheduling of electric vehicle (EV) loads to reduce its impact during peak loading conditions. Further, the increase in the harmonic distortion due to the increasing EVCSs and other nonlinear loads is mitigated through the optimal allocation of active power filters (APFs). Transformer derating due to harmonics is also evaluated, and the transformer rating is upgraded accordingly. For robust expansion planning, future load demand is predicted using Random Forest (RF) regression, while uncertainties in EV driving patterns are managed using the 2m-point estimation method (2m-PEM). During solution of the expansion planning problem, this paper focuses on minimizing energy losses and costs while maximizing the average happiness index (AHI) of the EV users.

EVs can serve either as a load or storage, presenting a dual-faceted challenge to power system planning and operation. As a result, there is a growing need for comprehensive reliability assessment in the presence of EVs. This paper proposes improved reliability assessment frameworks for systems with large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) operating in battery exchange (BE) and plug-in modes. Initially, a reliability model for BE electric vehicles (BEVs) is formulated using a time-series aggregated EV user load profile, BE station operation strategy, and off-peak battery exchange mode of BEVs. Additionally, a random-sampling-based operational algorithm is developed for plug-in EVs (PEVs), considering their charging, discharging, and grid support modes. A composite reliability assessment framework is then developed, incorporating an optimization model that accounts for the aggregated operations of BEVs and PEVs. The effect of EVs on the system reliability is assessed using the mixed-timing sequential Monte Carlo simulation on the IEEE RTS-79 and the RTS-GMLC systems. Simulation results show that up to 18% improvement in reliability indices is achieved with a 15% penetration of BEVs operating in off-peak mode. Also, the same penetration of PEVs with grid-support modes yields up to 14% improvement in system reliability. Finally, the impacts of BEV and PEV integration on the loading and reliability of transmission lines and power transformers are analyzed. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Battery exchange mode; controlled charging; electric vehicles; plug-in mode; reliability","Battery exchange mode; Battery exchanges; Controlled charging; Grid supports; Large-scales; Plug-in modes; Plug-ins; Power; Reliability assessments; System reliability; Plug-in electric vehicles","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Electricity, under Award DE-SC0023422.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219078778"

Specifically, it focuses on optimizing charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles while managing constrained grid capacity. Businesses' increasing adoption of mid-size to heavy EV fleets has created a significant surge in electricity demand, often exceeding the local grid's ability to support charging at vehicles' base locations. Supply chain constraints that hinder timely infrastructure upgrades exacerbate this mismatch between demand and capacity. We present an optimization model for EV fleet charging location assignment that tackles this issue. Our approach considers multiple commercial fleet operators, each with a set of base locations for their vehicles. The model accounts for limited charging capacity at these bases and proposes strategically placing charging hubs in areas with excess grid capacity. We incorporate a flexible incentive framework into our model to encourage the use of these hubs and other non-base charging locations. The primary objective of this study is to optimize the allocation of charging resources for commercial EV fleets and to maintain grid stability in the face of rapidly growing demand. Our model integrates fleet operational constraints, grid limitations, and incentive structures to provide a comprehensive solution that benefits fleet operators and utility providers. To validate our approach, we perform a series of computational experiments based on realistic data from the city of San Antonio, TX, a major urban center in Texas. These simulations demonstrate the model's effectiveness in managing peak demand, optimizing resource utilization, and providing actionable insights for infrastructure planning. © 2013 IEEE.","Commercial fleet management; electric grid stability; electric vehicle fleet; incentive structure; location charging optimization","Charging stations; Fleet operations; Vehicle-to-grid; Commercial fleet managements; Electric grid stability; Electric grids; Electric vehicle fleet; Grid stability; Incentive structure; Location charging optimization; Optimisations; Optimization models; Vehicle fleets; Commercial vehicles","Funding text 1: \u2018\u2018This project and the preparation of this report were funded in part by monies provided by CPS Energy through an Agreement with The University of Texas at San Antonio.\u2019\u2019; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by monies provided by CPS Energy and Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (Cyber-Informed Engineering) through an Agreement with The University of Texas at San Antonio.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218761145"

While existing forecasting methods have made strides, they often fall short in addressing the challenges of low spatial resolution and spatial heterogeneity. Low spatial resolution, characterized by sparse data distribution and a dearth of information between geographically diverse charging stations, coupled with spatial heterogeneity, which is evident in the fluctuating energy demand across different regions, requires a sophisticated approach. In this study, we introduce the Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (MSSTGAN), a pioneering framework that adeptly navigates these complexities. MSSTGAN employs an encoder-decoder architecture underpinned by split-pyramid attention to resolve issues of low spatial resolution, enabling the model to process multi-scale data and capture temporal dynamics effectively. Moreover, it incorporates graph attention mechanisms to manage spatial heterogeneity in energy demand, ensuring a nuanced understanding of regional variations.

EVs are a hopeful way to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, but the way they charge can put a lot of stress on the grid, which can cause problems for both grid operators and EV users. The uncontrolled approach to EV charging could result in the development of new peak loads. This paper formulates a problem for the minimisation of EV charging cost while reducing the load variance using a dynamic charging strategy. This dynamic charging strategy forecasts the charging price of EV for each time stamp based on the available energy generation. The proposed formulation has also considered the seasonal variation in load profile. The model is solved using different optimisation algorithm and different scenarios have been formulated to validate the effectiveness of the optimisation problem which has been formulated to achieve the objectives of minimised charging cost and load variance. The proposed strategy has improved the charging cost by 67% from other strategies of EV charging while reduction in load variance comes out to be 69%. This proposed formulation will help in the higher adoption of EV's and will subsequently lead to sustainable growth. © 2025 The Author(s).

The sensitivity gate dynamically adjusts the model’s response based on external conditions, allowing for improved capture of input variability and temporal characteristics of the distribution network and DER. Additionally, a feedback mechanism within the model provides inputs from previous cell states into the forget gate, allowing for refined control over input selection and enhancing forecasting precision. Through case studies, the model demonstrates superior accuracy in hosting capacity predictions compared to baseline models like LSTM, ConvLSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, Stacked LSTM, and GRU. Study shows that the SERNN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.2030, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3884 and an R-squared value of 0.9854, outperforming the best baseline model by 48 per cent in MAE and 71 per cent in RMSE. Additionally, Feature engineering enhances the model’s performance, improving the R-squared value from 0.9145 to 0.9854. The sensitivity gate also impacts the model’s performance, lowering MAE to 0.2030 compared to 0.2283 without the sensitivity gate, and increasing the R-squared value from 0.9152 to 0.9854. Incorporating exogenous factors such as the time of day as a sensitivity gate input, further improves responsiveness, making the model more adaptable to real-world conditions. This advanced SERNN model offers a reliable framework for distribution network operators, supporting intelligent planning and proactive DER management. Ultimately, it provides a significant step forward in hosting capacity analysis, enabling more efficient and sustainable DER integration within next-generation distribution networks. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; battery energy storage systems; contextual input; distributed energy resources; EVs; hosting capacity; PV; sensitivity gate; sensitivity-enhanced recurrent neural network (SERNN)","Battery storage; Battery energy storage systems; Contextual input; Distributed Energy Resources; EV; Hosting capacity; Mean absolute error; Neural-networks; PV; Sensitivity gate; Sensitivity-enhanced recurrent neural network; Recurrent neural networks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216116766"

The availability of charging stations helps to encourage the global transition to electric vehicles, which may lead to a decrease in traditional fuel consumption. Nevertheless, the rise in the number of electric vehicles is accompanied by sustainability issues, such as managing the grid’s electrical demand, building more charging stations, and providing electricity from renewable resources in an efficient and sustainable manner, especially in Saudi Arabia. This work focused on three challenges regarding the installation of fast charging stations (FCSs) for electric vehicles (EVs) on highways. The first challenge is choosing optimal locations on highways to address the range of anxiety of EV drivers. The second challenge is to fuel these FCSs using renewable resources, such as photovoltaic (PV) panels, to make FCSs sustainable. The last challenge is to design FCSs by considering both highway driving behavior and the available renewable energy resources in order to cover charging demand. All of these challenges should be considered while planning the EV charging infrastructure of Saudi highways from both technical and economic perspectives. Thus, using the HOMER® Grid software (version 1.10.1 June 2023), locations on Saudi Arabian highways were selected based on the renewable resources of several roads that support a large number of vehicles traveling on them. These roads were the Makkah to Riyadh, Makkah to Abha, Riyadh to Dammam, Riyadh to NEOM, and Jeddah to NEOM roads. Electric vehicle charging stations with a capacity of 200 kW, 300 kW, and 500 kW were designed on these roads based on their natural renewable resources, which is PV energy. These roads are the most important roads in the Kingdom and witness heavy traffic. An economic study of these stations was carried out in addition to considering their efficiency. This study revealed that the 500 kW station is ideal for charging electric vehicles, with an annual energy production of 3,212,000 kWh. The 300 kW station had better efficiency but higher capital expenses. The 200 kW station could charge 6100 vehicles annually. The three stations on the Makkah to Riyadh, Makkah to Abha, and Riyadh to Dammam roads can charge 65,758 vehicles annually. The total cost of the project was USD 2,786,621, with the 300 kW plant having the highest initial investment, which can be potentially justified due to its higher power output. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the project costs and the potential returns of using solar power plants for charging electric vehicles. © 2025 by the author.","charging station; electric vehicle; HOMER software; microgrid; renewable energy; solar power system","Concrete pavements; Depreciation; Electric power system economics; Electric vehicles; Fast charging (Batteries); Flow batteries; Geophysical prospecting; Geothermal fields; Hydroelectric power; Mass transportation; Mineral exploration; Model structures; Motor transportation; Outfalls; Overhead lines; Phosphate deposits; Rescue vessels; Solar energy; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Surface waters; Vehicle-to-grid; Water wells; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Fast charging stations; HOMER software; Microgrid; Renewable energies; Renewable resource; Saudi Arabia; Solar Power Systems; Techno-economics; Charging stations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216078086"

By seamlessly integrating electric vehicles (EVs) and battery energy storage systems (BESSs), these hubs address critical challenges such as grid stress, renewable energy utilization, and peak load management. This study introduces a novel mathematical optimization model designed to maximize the operational flexibility of EV charging stations by transforming them into fully functional energy hubs. The model incorporates key parameters such as energy demands, load profiles, and grid conditions to optimize the sizing and operation of distributed energy resources, including photovoltaic (PV) systems and BESSs. The proposed approach minimizes grid dependency, enabling energy hubs to efficiently operate varying levels of operational flexibility, from full reliance on grid power to complete independence. The results reveal that, by effectively shifting energy usage away from peak periods and leveraging PV generation, energy hubs emerge as a critical component of sustainable energy systems and can independently support approximately 45% of their load, with minimal PV and BESS capacities. It also reveals a direct correlation between higher flexibility levels and increased infrastructure requirements for PV systems and BESSs. The proposed model underscores the critical role of energy hubs in facilitating the global shift toward decarbonization, aligning with contemporary goals for resilient and environmentally sustainable energy ecosystems.

However, building owners investing in V2B infrastructure while generating revenue from V2G services face challenges in planning and coordinating with EV owners due to uncertainties in their schedules and profit-sharing expectations. Additionally, misaligned building and grid peak times can create conflicts between V2B and V2G goals, which may negatively impact the building electricity bill. Unlike previous studies that used a contract-free approach for aggregating V2B and V2G, resulting in inconsistent participation, this article proposes a novel planning and contracting framework that enables building owner to determine the optimal contract parameters with EV owners. These parameters include minimum participation time in DR events, minimum arrival state of charge (SoC), and permitted emergency departure hours. The framework supports V2B aggregation with on-site distributed energy resources (DERs) for DR and V2G services, ensuring transparency and fairness through shared profits and performance-based penalties, while compensating building electricity bills due to V2G activities. The framework is composed of a tri-stage optimization process that uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate EV owner profit assessments, select optimal EV candidates based on charger availability, estimate contract parameters with profit/penalty sharing, and assign contracts between power system operators (PSOs), building owners, and EV owners under multiple virtual scenarios. Simulation results validate the contract parameter assessment and its performance via a 3-day case study with real-world datasets that demonstrates net revenue generation of {\} 209 for each EV owner and {\} 950 for building owners during DR events with a return on investment (ROI) of 134.5% and 130.7% for the EVs and Building owners, respectively. © 2015 IEEE.","Contract-based design; demand response (DR); distributed energy resources (DERs); vehicle to building (V2B); vehicle to grid (V2G)","Clinical laboratories; Geophysical prospecting; Research laboratories; Windows; Building owners; Building services; Contract-based designs; Demand response; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity bill; Grid services; Optimal design; Vehicle to building; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215422738"

Here, the SGS is represented as grid-connected multi-microgrids (MMGs), which are equipped with distributed generators (DGs), i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines (WTs), battery energy storage systems (BESs), electric vehicle charging stations, capacitor banks, chillers, and building load power demand (LPD). Maintaining the PQ parameters of the SGS within the threshold limits is challenging due to the stochastic nature of building LPD and the dynamic behaviors of chiller operations. Furthermore, reactive power compensation with capacitor banks and robust control of DGs with BESs might not be a straightforward solution to improve the PQ parameters due to the nonlinearity of building LPD, the intermittent nature of DG power, and the limited capacity of BESs. In this context, an artificial neural network approach is used to predict the future values of building LPD, DG power, and cooling power demand. The SGS energy sources, converters, and grid connections are modeled at the system level. PQ index models are developed based on PQ parameter threshold limits. A fuzzy-based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy-sharing strategy is developed based on a unique identification index, an energy-sharing index, and DGs' energy supplying, sharing, or buying to and/or from the neighborhood building. The BESs' charging and discharging control strategy is implemented based on the available energy in BESs. Furthermore, a cooling energy demand (CED) reduction strategy is implemented based on the predicted mean voltage and building CED index. Finally, an EMS is implemented for the SGS, which consists of existing and proposed EMS. The existing EMS is the baseline strategy, which provides available DG energy to the building, and deficit energy is supplied from the grid. The proposed EMS is the PQ parameter mitigation strategy, which maintains the PQ parameters within the threshold limits through the fuzzy-based P2P energy-sharing strategy. Measured data from the SGS are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS. Through simulation studies, it is shown that the proposed EMS is capable of maintaining the PQ parameters within the threshold limits and reducing CED by concurrently enabling SGS energy. © IEEE. 1969-2012 IEEE.","Artificial neural network; battery energy storage; distributed generations; energy management; fuzzy logic; multi-microgrids; peer-to-peer; power quality","Associative storage; Asynchronous generators; Banking; Battery management systems; Battery storage; Capacitor storage; Charging stations; Chilling; Compact disks; Competitive intelligence; Costs; Cryoelectric storage; Decision making; Empowerment of personnel; Enterprise resource planning; Industrial relations; Job analysis; Lean production; Marketing; Nuclear batteries; Product development; Refrigerators; Six sigma; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Static Var compensators; Virtual storage; Voltage scaling; And power quality; Battery energy storage; Energy; Fuzzy-Logic; Management strategies; Multi micro-grids; Neural-networks; Peer to peer; Power; Smart grid; Microgrids","Received 1 December 2023; revised 24 October 2024; accepted 3 January 2025.

However, the surge in charging demand not only causes voltage fluctuations and a decline in power quality but also leads to tension in the power grid load in some areas. The complexity of urban road networks further increases the challenge of charging station planning. Although laying out charging stations in areas with high traffic flow can better meet traffic demands, it may also damage power quality due to excessive grid load. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an optimized layout plan for electric vehicle charging stations considering the coupling effects of roads and electricity. By using section power flow to extract dynamic data from the power distribution network and comparing the original daily load curves of the power grid and electric vehicles, this paper plans reasonable capacity and charging/discharging schemes for EVCSs. It considers the impact of the charging and discharging characteristics of EVCSs on the power grid while satisfying the peak-shaving and valley-filling regulation benefits. Combined with the traffic road network, the optimization objectives include optimizing the voltage deviation, transmission line margin, network loss, traffic flow, and service range of charging stations. The Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is used for solving, and the optimal layout plan for electric vehicle charging stations is obtained. Finally, through road–electricity coupling network simulation verification, the proposed optimal planning scheme effectively expands the charging service range of electric vehicles, with a coverage rate of 83.33%, alleviating users’ charging anxiety and minimizing the impact on the power grid, verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme. © 2024 by the authors.","electric vehicle charging station; multi-objective optimization; optimal layout planning; road–electricity coupling","","This paper was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFB2401300).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214517857"

Identifying the impact of smart prosumers on microgrids may assist decision makers to find the challenges and make suitable changes. The operation of reconfigurable microgrids with high penetration of green smart homes (SHs), charging stations (CSs) and hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) has not been addressed in the literature, so, this paper aims to propose a framework for energy management in the mentioned smart consumers/prosumers and investigate their impact on host microgrids. In the proposed framework, firstly, all electric vehicles (EVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) optimize their own charging schedule using the price signals received through vehicle-to-infrastructure technology; in the second level, each HFS, CS or SH solves its own energy management model and in the third level, the operator of the microgrid solves its day-ahead operational planning model. The solvers of General Algebraic modeling Systems (GAMS) are used to solve all the mentioned models. The results confirm the efficiency of the developed multi-level methodology; according to the results, the studied microgrid enjoys a daily profit of $571.47, meaning that the revenue, earned by selling electricity to CSs, SHs, HFSs and its own demands is considerably higher than sum of the cost of its micro-turbines and the cost of purchased electricity from upstream grid. The results indicate that the batteries decrease the daily cost of smart homes by 4 %; moreover, the results suggest that batteries cause drastic change in operation cost of the microgrid. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Microgrids; Reconfigurable microgrids; Renewable energy; Smart homes; Transportation electrification","Charging stations; Hydrogen fuels; Microgrids; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging station; Hydrogen fuelling stations; Microgrid; Prosumer; Reconfigurable; Reconfigurable microgrid; Renewable energies; Smart homes; Transportation electrifications; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy management; fuel cell; hydrogen; smart grid","Murodbek Safaraliev gratefully acknowledges the research funding received from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Ural Federal University Program of Development within the Priority-2030 Program).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214245747"

This study examines the effects of unidirectional and bidirectional electric vehicle charging in New England using a least-cost optimization model. It finds that in a 100 % unidirectional charging electric vehicle adoption scenario, annual electricity demand could increase by 42 % (∼50 TW-hours), necessitating dynamic load management and adjustments in time-of-use pricing. While this added demand underscores the need for cost-effective renewable and storage solutions, “vehicle-to-grid” technology emerges as a key strategy to manage peak loads, reducing costs by 35 % compared to “unidirectional charging one-way vehicle” and easing reliance on grid batteries. Despite benefits like enhanced system flexibility and reduced capacity expansion needs, “vehicle-to-grid” poses challenges, including battery degradation, which can be mitigated by second-life battery use. Balancing unidirectional and bidirectional charging strategies is essential for optimizing grid performance, minimizing costs, and advancing a sustainable energy future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles (EVs); Energy storage; Energy transition; Grid integration; New England; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Electric vehicle; Energy; Energy transitions; Grid integration; New England; Power grids; Sustainable energy; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G); adoption behavior; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electrification; energy storage; optimization; smart grid; United States","The authors thank the financial support for this graduate-level research provided by National Grid plc.

Charging station siting and sizing are two key challenges in the planning with each of them being a complex optimization problem. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to solve them together. First, considering that accurate charging demand estimation is crucial for planning, a traffic road network is established for this purpose. A Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of charging demand in a region based on the probabilistic characteristics of user trips. Since uncoordinated charging not only increases the load but also leads to unstable operation of the local power system, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to coordinate charging scheduling. Then, based on the scheduled demand, this paper proposes a framework for the siting and sizing of charging stations to optimize the benefits for both operators and users by minimizing the construction, operation and maintenance costs, and the user's detour time. As the given problem is a complex multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, it is easy to fall into local optimum if traditional evolutionary algorithms are employed. Therefore, a multi-objective dynamic binary particle swarm optimization method is designed to solve this problem effectively. Finally, experimental simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the other comparative algorithms in terms of solution quality. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing the location and capacity of charging stations. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","charging scheduling; charging station planning; Electric vehicle; Monte Carlo simulation; multi-objective optimization","Combinatorial optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Charging demands; Charging scheduling; Charging station; Charging station planning; Electric vehicle charging; Monte Carlo's simulation; Multi-objective planning; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Siting and sizings; Multiobjective optimization","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Key Research and Development Project of China under Grant 2021YFB1600100; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52172325 and Grant 61902039; in part by the Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2023M733068; in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities, Chang'an University (CHD), under Grant 3001022422 and Grant 300102244204; and in part by the China Scholarship Council.; Funding text 2: Received 17 November 2023; revised 25 May 2024 and 3 September 2024; accepted 11 November 2024.

A transaction framework for electricity‑hydrogen exchange among the vehicle fleet aggregator (VFA), the electrical power system operator (EPSO) and the hydrogen system operator (H2SO) is proposed. The optimization model, based on a bi-layer Stackelberg game, aims to minimize the electricity‑hydrogen costs for the VFA in the upper layer, and maximize the economic benefits for the EPSO and the H2SO in the lower layer. A Stackelberg-game model is formulated and solved using the DEA-MILP approach. The proposed optimization strategy is evaluated using a regional integrated electricity‑hydrogen system (RIEHS), which consists of an IEEE 33-bus distribution power system and a 6-node hydrogen system. The evaluation considers the impacts of distribution locational marginal price (DLMP) profile of electricity and hydrogen, as well as the penetration of EV-HV and electrolysis. The simulation results show that: 1) the proposed Stackelberg-equilibrium-based bidding mechanism can determine the electricity‑hydrogen DLMP based on the data from VFA and RIEHS; 2) the optimization strategy enables collaborative charging management of EVs and HVs, as well as electricity‑hydrogen dispatch within RIEHS; and 3) implementing the proposed strategy leads to a reduction in the energy cost for the VFA and alleviates operating power congestion for the RIEHS. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Charging management strategy; Distribution locational marginal price (DLMP); Electrical vehicle (EV); Hydrogen vehicle (HV); Regional integrated electricity‑hydrogen system (RIEHS); Stackelberg-equilibrium","Charging time; Fleet operations; Linear programming; State of charge; Charging management strategy; Charging managements; Distribution locational marginal price; Electrical vehicle; Electrical vehicles; Hydrogen system; Hydrogen vehicle; Hydrogen vehicles; Locational marginal prices; Management strategies; Regional integrated electricity‑hydrogen system; Stackelberg equilibrium; Charging stations; alternative fuel; distribution system; electric vehicle; electrical power; electricity supply; hydrogen; optimization; planning method; policy strategy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206922269"

However, the increased adoption of electric vehicles presents challenges to the power grid and could create a surge in demand characterized by fast-absorbing electrical energy. This surge can affect voltage profiles and escalate energy losses within distribution lines. This study introduces an optimization framework leveraging parallel search real-coded genetic algorithms (PSRCGA) for the efficient allocation and sizing of fast charging stations, vehicle-to-grid integration, and capacitors utilization. The optimization aims to enhance grid profitability by minimizing capacitor costs and optimizing power quality metrics through a multi-objective function. Various constraints such as power balance, bus voltage, current flow limits, and capacitor bank specifications are considered in the optimization process. By employing the PSRCGA, the study proposes a fitness function that effectively incorporates the objective function with the constraints.

To charge EVs and FCVs, electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and hydrogen fuelling stations (HFSs) are respectively needed. The review of the literature indicates that the operational planning of EVCSs integrated in distribution systems has not received enough attention; on the other hand, it is crucial to push EVCSs, HFSs and distribution systems towards 100 % renewable systems; so, in this research, the aim is to build a framework for the integration of emission-free EVCSs and HFSs in emission-free distribution systems considering their impact on transmission system operator. The Case study is the IEEE 57-bus transmission system connected to three 33-bus distribution systems, integrated with EVCSs and HFSs. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models are used for EVs, FCVs, HFSs, EVCSs and transmission system, while Mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQCP) model is used for distribution system.

The results show that due to PV modules and storage systems, the operation of all EVCSs and HFSs is profitable. The results show that the operation of all DSs is profitable; indeed, due to the existence of PV and wind generators which have no operation cost, the revenue of DSs is higher than their cost.

According to the characteristics of the various adjustable resources in the network, they are divided into day-ahead and intraday optimizations. The optimization process in the day-ahead stage uses the NSDBO to create a discrete equipment scheduling plan. The optimization process in the intraday stage combines the discrete equipment scheduling plan with the MPC to create the scheduling plan for photovoltaics, energy storage, and vehicle charging stations. Two-stage optimization scheduling is achieved with the lowest discrete equipment regulation cost and minimization of network loss and node voltage deviation penalty cost as the optimization goal. The feasibility of this method for coordinating various resources in the network, processing discrete and continuous variables, and coping with the volatility and uncertainty of high-proportion distributed resources is verified through case analysis. The effectiveness of this method in improving the security and economy of distribution networks is demonstrated.

As decentralized prosumers become more integrated into smart grids, innovative coordination methods are required to fully leverage their potential and improve the system's self-healing capabilities. Hence, in this paper, we present a decentralized two-layer model for active distribution networks (ADNs) incorporating commercial energy hubs, Parking lots (PLs), hydrogen refueling stations, and mobile units (MUs). This model aims to maximize the flexible capacities of flexible prosumers under emergencies and includes a dynamic mechanism for transporting hydrogen to refueling stations via trucks. In the first layer of the model, the AND operator provides the required services to flexible prosumers, including commercial energy hubs, PLs and hydrogen refueling stations. During this layer, the movement paths of mobile units, such as battery-based mobile storage units (MSUs) and mobile hydrogen units (MHUs), are determined. In the second layer, prosumers independently plan and decide the extent of their service contributions. Subsequently, with the actual service capacities established, the AND operator re-optimizes the initial planning to finalize the system schedule and precise movement paths of the mobile units.

However, the proliferation of EVs increases the demand on distribution network (DN), which already face challenges due to three-phase asymmetrical loads and impedance mismatches. The combination of charging demand and traditional three-phase loads aggravated the nodal voltage imbalance within DN. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a coordinated planning model for a three-phase unbalanced distribution network (TUDN) and urban transportation network (UTN). The model optimizes the placement of fast charging stations (FCS), line expansions, and road enhancements, using a distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) strategy to improve charging traffic flow (CTF) and reduce voltage imbalances. To ensure privacy encryption, a fully distributed framework using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is designed to solve this problem, where a two-layer iterative process (TIP) is further developed to improve the convergence of ADMM, taking into account the integer variables in the model. Numerical simulations on a modified IEEE 34-bus system and a real-world system in China demonstrate the model’ s effectiveness, achieving a 43.84 % reduction in maximum voltage imbalance and outperforming other algorithms in iteration count and computation time. © 2024","Electric vehicles; Fully distributed framework; Nodal voltage imbalance; Three-phase unbalanced distribution network; Urban transportation network","Fast charging (Batteries); Traffic control; Distributed framework; Fully distributed framework; Nodal voltage; Nodal voltage imbalance; Three phase; Three phasis; Three-phase unbalanced distribution network; Unbalanced distribution networks; Urban transportation networks; Voltage imbalance; Urban transportation; carbon emission; design; electric vehicle; global climate; global warming; planning practice; transportation system; urban transport; China","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (U22B2098).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203619002"

Particularly, we focus on achieving cooperation between homes in a way that is fully privacy-preserving, scalable, and that allows for the management of distribution network voltage constraints. Previous work demonstrated that MARL-based distributed control can be achieved with no sharing of personal data required during execution. However, previous cooperative MARL-based approaches impose an ever greater training computational burden as the size of the system increases, limiting scalability. Moreover, they do not manage their impact on distribution network constraints. We therefore adopt a deep multi-agent actor–critic method that uses a centralised but factored critic to rehearse coordination ahead of execution, such that homes can successfully cooperate at scale, with only first-order growth in computational time as the system size increases. Training times are thus 34 times shorter than with a previous state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach without the factored critic for 30 homes. Moreover, experiments show that the cooperation of agents allows for a decrease of 47.2% in the likelihood of under-voltages. The results indicate that there is significant potential value for management of energy user bills, battery depreciation, and distribution network voltage management, with minimal information and communication infrastructure requirements, no interference with daily activities, and no sharing of personal data. © 2024 The Author(s)","Cooperative systems; Demand-side response; Distributed control; Electric vehicles; Energy management system; Multi-agent reinforcement learning","Adversarial machine learning; Demand response; Federated learning; Reinforcement learning; Centralised; Cooperative systems; Decentralized cooperation; Demand side response; Distributed-control; Energy; Energy flexibility; Management systems; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Residential energy; Deep reinforcement learning; cooperative sector; decentralization; demand-side management; electric vehicle; energy management; infrastructure planning; learning; machine learning; residential energy; training","Thomas Morstyn reports financial support was provided by UK Research and Innovation and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (award references EP/S000887/1, EP/S031901/1, and EP/T028564/1).

For all the scenarios, it can be seen that the modified JAYA algorithm outperforms TLBO and other existing approaches.

Meanwhile, the continuous growth in demand for EV charging would significantly impact the secure operation of power systems. Considering the vulnerability of vehicle navigation communication networks, this paper proposes a novel and practical joint cyber-attack scheme to manipulate the charging and route planning results of EV charging navigation. This cyber-attack can minimize both the charging price at the target EV charging station (EVCS) and the driving time required to reach the target EVCS, thus threatening the secure operation of power systems by attracting excessive EVs to charge at the target EVCS. Firstly, a two-level optimization model is proposed to identify the target EVCS based on the partially observable distribution network. This model identifies the EVCS that pose the greatest threat to the secure operation of power systems. Subsequently, a cyber-attack model is developed to manipulate the driving time of EVs to the target EVCS. The attack vector is designed to be stealthy to evade detection and sparse to minimize attack cost. Finally, based on the relationship between charging price and demand, an adaptive cyber-attack model for EV charging price is designed. When the joint cyber-attack is launched, EVs can be reasonably attracted to the target EVCS, regardless of the charging preferences of EV drivers. The coupled test system consisting of an IEEE 33-bus system and a 46-node transportation system verifies the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and model. © 2015 IEEE.","charging price; Cyber-attacks; electric vehicle (EV); electric vehicle charging navigation system (EVCNS); route planning","Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Computer crime; Crime; Cyber attacks; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Intelligent systems; Navigation; Secure communication; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Charging price; Charging station; Cyber attack modeling; Cyber-attacks; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging navigation system; EV Charging; Operation of power system; Route planning; Navigation systems; Network security","This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grant Council for the Research Project under Grant 15205424.

Real demographic and mobility data from ten Riyadh Metro station zones are used to estimate daily EV arrival rates and charging demand, enabling location-specific infrastructure planning. Photovoltaic-powered wireless charging is introduced as a demand-shaping mechanism to relieve fast-charging congestion and reduce grid dependency. The model shows that serving 40 % of the daily EV load wirelessly can reduce charger requirements by up to 60%and lower average queue delays by more than 80 %.

The queuing analysis highlights the critical role of wireless load share and session duration in maintaining system stability, while the agent-based simulation models user behavior under real-time pricing and charger constraints.

In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a pricing and control strategy for battery changing stations (BCSs) across multiple markets. Firstly, a Bayesian adaptive spline surface based sensitivity analysis method is employed to quantify the impact of pricing on road congestion rates. In the intraday market, a dynamic pricing strategy, guided by sensitivity analysis, is designed to influence EV traffic flow with minimal price adjustments. This optimizes BCS revenue in energy and reserve capacity markets while alleviating traffic congestion and reducing the communication burden. In the real-time market, a game-based subjective and objective evaluation method is developed to assess the response characteristics of BCSs considering factors such as communication delays, regulation capacity, and market revenue, enabling an equitable allocation of frequency regulation tasks among BCSs.

Flexible interconnection devices optimize line power flow, while energy routers (ERs) regulate node-level power. Their combination effectively addresses these challenges. This paper proposes a two-layer planning method integrating the rotary power flow controller (RPFC) and ER across spatial and temporal dimensions to improve economy and carrying capacity. RPFC advantages over other flexible devices are analysed, and mathematical models for RPFC and ER are developed. The upper layer minimizes total network cost for siting and sizing, while the lower layer coordinates operation using indicators of stability, balance, economy, and flexibility. A hybrid optimization algorithm combining an improved gravitational field algorithm (IGFA) and second-order cone programming (SOCP) is introduced, incorporating a tent chaotic map and elite retention strategy. Simulation results show the method reduces network losses by 20.8% and increases carrying capacity by 15.9%.

Examples of such transformations have been visible since the introduction of the supervisory control and data acquisition and energy management systems several decades ago, enhancing overall network stability and reliability and enabling better prediction of faults and more rapid response to disruptions. Since then, investments in new monitoring and communication technologies have resulted in an advanced metering infrastructure capable of collecting large amounts of data, ranging from assets and devices to the system level. Data availability leads to advanced digital models and platforms, helping to resolve open challenges in modern power systems, including handling increasing levels of renewable energy, controllability of large numbers of distributed energy resources (DERs), and the need for faster and more flexible operational decision-making models. In this context, the concept of virtual power plants (VPPs) has emerged, facilitating the decentralized dispatch and control of larger numbers of DERs, such as solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage systems, electric vehicles, and flexible loads, via a digital platform that enables a unified coordination.

This paper presents a two-stage framework to segment and forecast electric-vehicle (EV) charging behavior using spatio-temporal features extracted from one year of 15-minute telematics for 264 EVs in Saskatchewan, Canada. The feature set combines temporal usage (power/energy levels and variability) with spatial mobility (home-charging ratio, location diversity, travel distance and angular dispersion). We compare three complementary clustering families including Fuzzy C-Means (soft membership), Gaussian Mixtures (probabilistic partitions), and Hierarchical clustering (multiscale structure) and using algorithm-appropriate selection criteria (Xie–Beni, BIC, elbow/Calinski–Harabasz) to ensure a fair assessment. The framework identifies five behaviorally meaningful groups ranging from home-dominant commuters to high-mobility, DC fast-charging users. Hierarchical clustering provides the most balanced and interpretable segmentation (lowest Davies–Bouldin; highest Calinski–Harabasz), while GMM attains the highest Silhouette (0.585) with coarser partitions. In the supervised stage, ensemble classifiers forecast user-segment membership from features, with XGBoost achieving 98.1% accuracy. The outputs translate directly into planning inputs: expected residential feeder peaks for home-centric segments, DC fast-charging demand for high-mobility users, and demand-response potential for managed charging. The results indicate that spatio-temporal features coupled with hierarchical segmentation and gradient boosting provide actionable and scalable inputs for siting, tariff design, and grid operations. © 2013 IEEE.","charging behavior; clustering; Electric vehicles (EV); forecasting; fuzzy C-means (FCM); Gaussian mixture model (GMM); hierarchical clustering; mobility patterns; principal component analysis (PCA); random forest; smart grid; XGBoost","Behavioral research; Charging (furnace); Clustering algorithms; Demand response; Electric charge; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Fast charging (Batteries); Fuzzy clustering; Gaussian distribution; Hierarchical clustering; Vehicle-to-grid; C-means; Charging behavior; Clusterings; Electric vehicle; Fuzzy C-mean; Gaussian Mixture Model; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical Clustering; Mobility pattern; Principal component analyze; Principal-component analysis; Random forests; Smart grid; Xgboost; Principal component analysis","This work was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Mitacs Joint Program under Grant ALLRP 586657-23 and Grant IT37304, and in part by the NSERC Discovery under Grant RGPIN-2021-04177.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105019754516"

To address this, a comprehensive planning framework is proposed considering EVCI, Photovoltaic (PV), and Battery Storage System (BSS), while minimizing techno-economic and reliability impacts using a novel Enhanced Harris Hawk Optimization (EHHO) technique that adheres to system constraints. The research employs a Deep Learning-based Gated Recurrent Unit algorithm to accurately forecast EV charging load and PV generation.

Results show that integrating PV and BSS with EVCI significantly improves the system reliability, voltage profile and reduces power loss.

This study introduces a comprehensive Demand Side Management (DSM) framework tailored for a smart grid where all the consumers are considered to have an EV. A novel emission estimation approach is proposed, incorporating the nonlinear relationship between generation cost and pollutant emissions to more accurately evaluate environmental impact. To address the competing objectives of minimizing peak load, operational cost, and total emissions, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved using a newly developed hybrid Butterfly Green Anaconda Optimization (BFGAO) algorithm. The algorithm also determines the optimal sizing of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) while coordinating EV charging and discharging under a real-time pricing scheme. The arrival and departure behaviors of EVs are modelled using Gamma and Weibull distributions to reflect realistic user behavior. The proposed approach achieves a peak load reduction of 73.68%, a total operational cost reduction of 23.67%, and a total emission reduction of 72.54%, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving grid performance and environmental sustainability. The robustness of the algorithm is validated through benchmark functions, sensitivity analysis, and ANOVA testing.

To address this, a multi-stage optimal allocation method for newly added electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) based on comprehensive service performance is proposed. First, an improved Huff model incorporating charging station attributes, travel time value, and individual user preferences analyses probabilistic charging behaviour to determine service range and charging demand. Second, a comprehensive evaluation method using power utilisation rate, effective service rate, and capacity redundancy is established, with indicator weights determined by an Analytic Hierarchy Process-Entropy Weight (AHP-EW) method integrated into a fuzzy theory-based scoring system. Third, an allocation model integrating comprehensive service evaluation from a combined operator-user economic perspective is formulated. Finally, an Immune Clone Selection–Variable Neighbourhood Search (ICS–VNS) hybrid algorithm is designed for efficient optimisation. Case studies demonstrate that, compared to the existing planning scheme, both the single-station and two-station deployment schemes reduce peak demands at existing busiest charging stations by 16.1% and 27.5%.

As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to penetrate transportation systems, optimal integration of EVCSs within power distribution infrastructure becomes critical, not only to ensure seamless user experience but also to maintain the reliability and efficiency of electrical networks. Traditionally, EVCS planning has been carried out solely within the context of Radial Distribution Networks (RDNs), neglecting key consumer-centric factors such as travel comfort and accessibility within the road network (RN). This paper proposes a novel, consumer-aware methodology for optimally placing EVCSs and Distributed Generators (DGs) in a combined RDN-RN framework. The objective is to minimize active power loss, voltage variation, and EV consumer cost, measured through two proposed indices, while accounting for realistic travel behavior and preferences. The proposed approach utilizes a Modified Weighted Teaching Learning Based - Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (MWTLB-PSA) and proceeds in three stages: EVCS site selection based on road network considerations, DG placement using predetermined EVCS locations, and a final stage of simultaneous optimization of both elements. To validate the approach, a standard IEEE 33-bus RDN integrated with a 25-node RN is employed as the test system. Results demonstrate that the joint optimization of DGs and EVCSs via the proposed method significantly enhances network performance and consumer convenience. Notably, the solution achieves a reduced active power loss of 57.75 kW and an EVCCI value of 0.3958, indicating a substantial improvement over existing hybrid TLBO and PSO-based techniques. Furthermore, the proposed method leads to installation cost savings ranging from 2.51% to 18.21% compared to earlier strategies, underscoring its practical value in smart grid planning and deployment. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","Distributed energy resources; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging stations; Energy management; Metaheuristic algorithms; Multi-objective optimization; Power distribution systems; Smart grid planning","Charging (batteries); Consumer behavior; Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy resources; Highway administration; Highway planning; Islanding; Motor transportation; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power distribution networks; Power distribution reliability; Roads and streets; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging station; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Energy; Grid planning; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Multi-objectives optimization; Power-distribution system; Smart grid; Smart grid planning; Site selection","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018303448"

This work undertakes a comprehensive review of the application of game theory in the planning, operation, and scheduling of new power systems. Through an analysis of 143 research works, the applications of game theory are categorized into three key areas: RES, ESS, and EV charging infrastructure. Moreover, the game theory approaches, payoff/objective functions, players, and strategies used in each study are thoroughly summarized. In addition, the potential for game theory based on artificial intelligence is explored. Lastly, this review discusses existing challenges and offers valuable insights and suggestions for the future research directions. © 2019 Power System Protection and Control Press.","Game theory; new power system; operation and scheduling; planning; SimuNPS","Carbon dioxide; Carbon emissions; Electric power system protection; Energy development; Energy storage; Natural resources; Renewable energy; Energy; Game theory applications; New power system; Operation and scheduling; Power; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy source; SimuNPS; Storage systems; Systems Structure; Game theory","FUNDING This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62263014); the Yunnan Provincial Basic Research Project (No. 202301AT070443 and No. 202401AT070344); and the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) Sailing Program (No. 22YF1414400).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015841531"

To meet the increasing demand for EV charging, charging stations must be strategically incorporated into the power grid. This integration requires careful planning to minimize impacts on the electrical network while balancing costs for both system operators and EV users. This paper presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art in the optimized planning of EV charging stations, aiming to guide future research and address emerging challenges associated with the rising energy demand from EVs. The review explores key methodologies for optimizing EV charging infrastructure, including the use of fast and slow charging options and their effects on the power system; the integration of distributed energy resources; the spatio-temporal distribution of EVs; the objective functions considered; and the optimization approaches adopted. It also examines the implementation of demand response strategies, such as time-of-use tariffs and smart charging. Finally, the review highlights the main research gaps, including the need to address environmental and economic factors, account for dynamic and uncertain variables, incorporate EV user behavior data, and integrate multiple objectives in practical applications. © 2013 IEEE.","Charging mode; charging station; distributed energy resource; electric vehicle; optimized planning","Behavioral research; Demand response; Distributed energy; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Fast charging (Batteries); Integration; Charging modes; Charging station; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Global trends; Optimized planning; Reduced cost; Systematic Review; Vehicle users; Charging stations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015437351"

A two-stage optimisation problem is formulated for this. The first stage is used to minimise the total cost of MG to optimally design MG and the second stage is used to optimally allocate PEVCSs and DSTATCOM in MGs by minimising the operational performance index, which is a weighted sum of energy loss and voltage deviation indices. Differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms are used to solve the MG design optimisation problem. An exhaustive search-based approach is also employed to show the impact of the placement of a PEVCS in sub-optimal locations (one at a time) of MGs on the operational parameters of MGs. A case study is also conducted with multiple placements of PEVCSs in MGs. The proposed approaches are validated on 33-bus, 69-bus and 52-bus Indian practical distribution networks. The results show that the placement of PEVCS in remote locations greatly deteriorates the operational parameters of MGs. With the optimal allocation of DSTATCOM, a significant reduction in the operational performance index of MGs with PEVCSs is observed. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Differential evolution algorithm; DSTATCOM; microgrid; plug-in electric vehicle charging station","Buses; Charging (batteries); Energy dissipation; Microgrids; Plug-in electric vehicles; Vehicle performance; Charging station; Differential evolution algorithms; Distribution static compensator; Microgrid; Operational parameters; Operational performance; Optimal planning; Performance indices; Plug-in electric vehicle charging; Plug-in electric vehicle charging station; Charging stations; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015357226"

The incorporation of Solar-Renewable Energy has increased to meet this increased demand. Hence, owing to the inappropriate incorporation of Solar-RE based Distributed Generations (DGs), the system becomes disturbed with increased losses, voltage profile imbalance, poor fault tolerance capability, and reliability issues. Also, it is terrible to fulfill the increased reactive demand of the Distribution Network (DN) by these DGs. Therefore, in this work, to address these issues, the appropriate planning of Solar-RE Integrated DSTATCOM based Charging Stations for EVs with ZIP Load Model is offered in view of the Sustainable Development Goals: Techno-Economic and Environmental challenges. The presented work's effectiveness is established on a 33-bus IEEE DN using PSO and TLBO by optimizing the TEE.

Although EVs do not produce tailpipe emissions, their widespread adoption may impose significant pressure on the decarbonization of the power system—a critical aspect often overlooked in planning and policy-making. Moreover, the actual environmental benefits of EVs depend on the source of electricity used for charging. Considering the power demand induced by EV charging, we develop a continuous-time dynamic model for the optimal planning of simultaneous EV adoption and the integration of renewable energy sources into the power system. The interactions between competing entities, such as EVs versus legacy vehicles, and renewable versus conventional energy sources, are incorporated into our mathematical model based on the Lotka-Volterra equations.

This work prioritizes bolstering DN resilience through network reconfiguration (NR), emergency repair crew (ERC) dispatch, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) response, providing topology, repair schedule, and power support. To measure the power support effect of EVs, an agent-based model (ABM) estimates EV aggregation for V2G response, considering key factors such as EV number, type, self-interested decision-making, behaviors, and traffic conditions. By integrating these parameters at macro and micro levels, agents interact with one another, including EVs, charging stations (CSs), CS aggregators, DN operators, and personalized trip advisors (PTAs). PTA navigates EVs to locate the nearest CS. Considering the interdependence of the three restoration methods, coordinated optimization is designed as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) with the IEEE 33 and PG&E 69 bus systems. The case study shows that the collaboration of these methods enhances load restoration efficiency and reduces operation costs.

These shifts introduce significant complexity into electricity load forecasting, challenging conventional centralized AI models. Such models often face limitations in scalability, generalization across heterogeneous environments, and preserving user data privacy. Furthermore, their lack of interpretability impedes transparent decision-making, an essential requirement in critical energy management and policy planning contexts. To address these issues, this study proposes HHCTE-FL, a Hierarchical Hybrid Convolutional Transformer Extractor embedded within a federated learning framework. The architecture supports multi-horizon electricity load forecasting while ensuring model transparency through Layer-wise Interpretative Attention Maps (LIAM) and robustness via personalized federated optimization. Functional modules such as Dynamic Temporal Refinement (DTR) and Multi-Stage Adaptive Feature Selection (MSAFS) enable adaptive temporal modeling and feature prioritization across non-IID client data. Evaluation on real-world smart grid datasets demonstrates that HHCTE-FL consistently surpasses 12 benchmark methods, attaining 98.7% accuracy, with the lowest forecast errors (MAE: 0.081, RMSE: 0.114). The model achieves convergence within just 28 communication rounds and operates with low overhead, while attaining a Federated Stability Index (FSI) of 0.96, indicating high training consistency. Statistical significance analysis further affirms its superiority in performance and reliability. By integrating explainable deep learning with privacy-preserving federated learning, HHCTE-FL establishes a scalable and trustworthy paradigm for intelligent electricity load forecasting—aligned with the demands of modern urban energy systems and smart city sustainability goals. © 2013 IEEE.","electricity load forecasting; federated learning; multi-horizon prediction; Smart cities; sustainability; transformer networks","Consumer behavior; Decision making; Deep learning; Electric load forecasting; Electric power plant loads; Energy policy; Learning systems; Smart power grids; Centralised; Decentralised; Electric consumers; Electricity load forecasting; Energy infrastructures; Generalisation; Integration of renewables; Load forecasting; Multi-horizon prediction; Transformer network; Smart city","The author extends the appreciation to the Deanship of Postgraduate Studies and Scientific Research at Majmaah University for funding this researchwork through the project number (R-2025-1870).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010183456"

The main contribution of this model is to manage the energy serving at the local energy communities in the presence of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Unlocking the demand response potential by the EVSE at the distribution network with the contribution of the active residential prosumers has been investigated in this study under different operational planning scenarios. The developed model is based on the multi-temporal optimal power flow (MTOPF) concept while the unbalanced nature of LV networks has been addressed using unbalanced power flow equations. The aggregator can effectively manage the optimal charging of electric vehicles (EVs) by home and public chargers available at the distribution network. Simulation results on a modified unbalanced LV network illustrate that the optimal operation of EVSE minimizes the electricity costs of end-users. The simulation results show that the operating costs and systems losses reduce by 9.22% and 43.45%, respectively.

However, the disorderly access of large-scale electric vehicles into the power grid threatens stability and security, and simultaneously rational planning of charging infrastructure is increasingly needed to meet the region-specific and time-varying demands. Thus, this work introduces a systematic framework combining spatiotemporal demand calculation and transferable prediction with Electric Vehicle charging station (EVCS) siting and sizing optimization. By leveraging partial EV trip data, the method can capture users’ driving patterns and supplement the citywide complete EV trip data, which is then fed into the established mathematical model to compute spatiotemporal charging demand. The derived best-performing ConvLSTM model, trained on basic features and calculated charging demand, can be applied to cross-city demand prediction by inputting identical basic features. This methodology is particularly tailored for prediction with limited or no corresponding data, mitigating data scarcity in underdeveloped small cities. Building upon this, a bi-level planning model is designed for EVCS siting and sizing, considering both user satisfaction and investment cost. The optimal coordinated EVCS construction strategy is obtained using the NSGA-II algorithm.

Unprecedented hike in fuel prices and environmental concerns have increased the usage of EVs for last-mile connectivity. An increase in the adoption of EVs also leads to an increase in the grid power demand. A typical EV docking station (EVDS) hosting EVs for last-mile connectivity is considered in this research. Hence, there is a need to locate EVDS, considering the optimal charging pattern of the EVs and the distance traveled. Initially, a ride-hailing company EVDS is modeled based on the type and level of charging. Based on charging profile observations from the advanced metering system, the EV charging system provider (CSP) must propose a suitable location for placing the docking stations corresponding to the energy required for charging the EV fleet. The proposed approach integrates an IEEE 69 Bus distribution network with a solar-powered EVDS. Integration makes use of solar energy as a primary or supplementary source for charging EVs, promoting sustainability and reducing reliance on the conventional grid. Solar photovoltaic (SPV) system-powered EVDS improves reliability and efficiency by reducing power losses. EVDS remains functional during peak demand or grid outages due to the distributed nature of SPV systems. The optimal placement of a solar-based EVDS in the IEEE 69 bus system will improve the charging time, system reliability, and greater utilization of renewable energy sources. Finally, the reliability test was carried out for the optimal placement of solar EVDS within an IEEE 69 BUS system. © © 2025 Sathieshkumar S. et al.

However, due to the current low rural electric vehicle ownership, the charging price compensation mechanism is not yet perfect, resulting in the planning period of electric vehicle growth and the willingness to respond to the tariff compensation policy is difficult to accurately assess. Methods: This paper proposes a rural photovoltaic storage and charging integrated charging station capacity allocation strategy based on the tariff compensation mechanism. Firstly, we construct a spatial-temporal dynamic distribution model of rural EV charging load coupled with distribution network - transportation network, and on this basis, we consider the rural EV charging time-sharing tariff and tariff compensation policy incentive, and amend the EV charging load transfer model; and then we construct an optimization planning model of charging station with the goal of minimizing the cost of construction, operation and maintenance, and maximizing the charging benefit of the integrated charging station in the rural area, and obtain the optimal synergistic planning scheme under the tariff compensation mechanism in the planning period. Results: The optimal collaborative planning scheme under the electricity price compensation mechanism is obtained, and the correctness and validity of the proposed optimal planning method of the rural optical storage charging station under the electricity price compensation mechanism is verified by the example, which is of positive significance in the promotion of the charging facilities to go to the countryside in an appropriate manner, and in the stimulation of the willingness of the rural consumers in the townships to purchase vehicles. Conclusion: (1) The spatial and temporal distribution and transfer model of rural EV charging loads with price incentives is constructed by taking into account the preferential charging price policies such as rural time-sharing tariff and tariff compensation mechanism. By comparing the operating revenues of optical storage-charging integrated charging stations with and without time-sharing tariffs and tariff compensation policies, we verified the incentive effect of multiple types of price incentives for the over-planning of rural electric vehicle charging facilities. (2) The proposed optimal configuration method of rural photovoltaic, storage and charging integration charging station can realize the in-situ utilization of rural renewable energy, tap the price competitiveness of photovoltaic, storage and charging integration, and weaken the cost of electricity consumption. By comparing the optimized configuration scheme with and without joint planning, it is verified that the moderate configuration of in-situ photovoltaic and energy storage equipment on the basis of the planning of charging piles brings benefits far exceeding the investment cost, and has a great role in increasing the operational efficiency of rural charging facilities. © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.","capacity optimization allocation; distribution model; electric vehicle charging station; integrated photovoltaic storage and charging; Rural distribution network; Spatio-temporal dynamic; tariff compensation mechanism","Carbon; Charging time; Costs; Data storage equipment; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric load distribution; Electric power distribution; Energy policy; Light electric vehicles; Optimization; Renewable energy; Rural areas; Spatial distribution; Vehicle to infrastructure; Capacity optimization; Capacity optimization allocation; Charging station; Compensation mechanism; Distribution models; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Integrated photovoltaic storage and charging; Optimization allocations; Photovoltaics; Rural distribution networks; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Tariff compensation mechanism; Charging stations","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Support Program of Guizhou Province ([2022] General012) and the Key Science and Technology Project of China Southern Power Grid Corporation (GZKJXM20220043).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008656871"

However, a single type of charging or swapping facility cannot simultaneously and efficiently satisfy the power supply requirements of diverse vehicle types. In order to solve this problem, a joint planning method of charging piles and charging-battery swapping stations (CBSSs) is proposed in this paper. In this method, the influence of geospatial constraints on the layout scale of charging piles is considered, and the Monte Carlo simulation method is used to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of charging and battery swapping demands of private electric vehicles (PEVs) and the battery swapping demands of taxi electric vehicles (TEVs) respectively. On this basis, the layout scale of charging piles of each functional area is determined during the maximum charging demand period in a day to meet the demands of PEVs for charging convenience. Then, an operating state model of CBSS is established for calculation of the objective function. At the same time, a planning model of CBSSs is established to minimize the annual social comprehensive cost, which takes into account the economy of CBSSs and the battery swapping convenience of EVs. The planning of CBSSs can meet the demands of TEVs and some PEVs for a rapid power supply. Finally, using the urban transportation network of Changchun and IEEE 33-node system as an example, the planning of charging piles and CCBSs in direct charging mode and peak shifting mode are simulated and analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed method enables PEVs and TEVs to access convenient and rapid power supply, and the planning result of CBSSs in direct charging mode is more economical, while peak shifting mode is more conducive to the safe operation of distribution networks. © 2015 CSEE.","charging piles; Charging-battery swapping station; electric vehicle; joint planning; spatiotemporal distribution of the charging and battery swapping demands","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Charging stations; Economics; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power distribution; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Monte Carlo methods; Power distribution planning; Secondary batteries; Taxicabs; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Battery swapping; Charging modes; Charging pile; Charging-battery swapping station; Direct charging; Joint planning; Power supply; Spatiotemporal distribution of the charging and battery swapping demand; Spatiotemporal distributions; Intelligent systems","Manuscript received August 8, 2021; revised December 16, 2021; accepted December 28, 2021.

The suggested method utilizes a Multi-Objective Monte Carlo (MOMC) simulation technique to assess various scenarios, specifically reducing total power losses, system cost, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions while guaranteeing voltage stability within predetermined thresholds. The simulation scheme combines dynamic PV output, accurately representing the daily solar generating cycles. In addition, it contains extra EV loads to model the increased penetration on the power distribution system. The research proposes specific spots within the power grid to place PV and BESS systems and applies zoning restrictions during the optimization computation step. The objective function imposes voltage violation fines; therefore, compliance with operational requirements is ensured. The findings indicate substantial decreases in power wastage and CO2 emissions at various levels of EV adoption (30, 50, and 70%). The most efficient PV and BESS systems setup change depending on the level of adoption of EVs, emphasizing the need for flexible approaches in constructing distribution networks. The findings provide valuable insights for power grid operators and regulators who aspire to improve the resilience and efficiency of power distribution networks in the face of increased EV integration. This contributes to the creation of strong and sustainable energy management policies. © 2025 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Dynamic Output; EV Penetration; Monte Carlo; Renewable Energy Integration","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007993622"

To maintain their current operations, a clear understanding of the charging infrastructure required and its relationship to existing power grid limitations is needed. This study presents an optimization framework to jointly design charging infrastructure and schedules within a logistics distribution network, validated through agent-based simulations. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and develop an agent-based model (ABM) to evaluate various designs and operations under stochastic conditions. Our experiments compare rule-based and optimized strategies in a case study of The Netherlands. Results show that current commercial solutions suffice for middle-mile logistics, with central co-design yielding average cost reductions of 5.2%-6.4% and an average 20.1% decrease in total installed power. While rule-based control effectively manages charging operations and mitigates delays, optimizing charge scheduling significantly reduces queuing times (99%), charging costs (13.5%), and time spent near capacity (10.9%). Our optimization-simulation framework paves the way for combining optimized infrastructure planning and realistic fleet operations in digital-twin environments. © 2015 IEEE.","Agent-based modeling; charging stations; electrification; optimization","Fleet operations; Integer linear programming; Linear programming; 'current; Agent based simulation; Charging infrastructures; Co-designs; Electric truck; Emission zone; European cities; Joint optimization; Optimization-based simulations; Zero emission; Integer programming","Received 24 December 2024; revised 23 April 2025; accepted 26 May 2025.

Conventional methods often fail to jointly address the interdependencies between these two systems, leading to suboptimal planning and increased operational costs. To address this issue, a two-stage joint-optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously optimize EV charging station siting and electric logistics vehicle (ELV) routing within PDNs. In the first stage, a multi-objective optimization model is employed to determine optimal charging station locations, balancing infrastructure costs and traffic flow capture efficiency. In the second stage, an adaptive routing model integrates charging constraints to optimize ELV operational costs. A hybrid optimization algorithm, combining self-adaptive MOEA/D and genetic algorithm with best-first search (GABFS), is developed to enhance computational efficiency and solution robustness. The proposed approach is validated on a benchmark distribution network with logistics scenarios, demonstrating significant reductions in both capital investment for charging infrastructure and logistics operational costs. The findings underscore the importance of coordinated charging and logistics planning in accelerating the transition towards sustainable electrified logistics networks. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Charging station planning; electric logistics vehicle (ELV); location-routing problem; traffic network; two-stage optimization","Multiobjective optimization; Traffic control; Charging infrastructures; Charging station planning; Electric logistic vehicle; Joint optimization; Location routing problem; Logistics system; Logistics vehicles; Power distribution network; Traffic networks; Two stage optimizations; Genetic algorithms","Received 22 October 2024; revised 10 February 2025, 23 April 2025, and 15 May 2025; accepted 21 May 2025.

Managing these uncertainties—especially EV late arrivals, EV early departures, and PV forecast errors—is essential for grid stability. This study proposes a proactive flexibility provision framework that leverages probabilistic forecasting and cumulative adjustment factors (CAFs) for dynamic refinement of flexibility bounds. The method enhances resource utilization and maintains flexibility availability, improving real-time power imbalance management. The proposed flexibility program also integrates unsuccessful day-ahead market participants into real-time operations, increasing distributed resource use and reducing reliance on the main grid. Numerical simulations on a 380-V low-voltage distribution system in Thailand demonstrate that the model successfully resolved all real-time power imbalances. Compared to the no-CAF baseline (61.59%), the proposed method reduced utility dependence to 69.10%. Log-normal distributions with low variance (e.g., σ =0.1 for PV and σ =0.5 for EV) have consistently achieved strong performance across mean absolute error, root mean square error, and coverage probability metrics—delivering accurate forecasts while supporting long-term contracts and grid planning.

Accurately identifying PEVs serves as a crucial prerequisite for the establishment of charging station infrastructure. Existing methods for PEV identification can be divided into two categories, i.e., knowledge-driven (KD) models and data-driven (DD) models. The former suffers from the impact of explicit features extracted by subjective experience on identification performance, while the implicit features obtained by the latter are sensitive to the quality of recorded data. An interpretable knowledge and data dual-driven (IKD-DD) model is, therefore, proposed to integrate the robustness and learning abilities of two kinds of models by a mutual information-guided joint training process. A multiattention (MA) mechanism is, moreover, adopted to fuse the explicit and implicit features to enhance the discrimination ability of the feature set instead of conventional feature concatenation. Besides, a prototype-based contrastive loss function was introduced to learn PEV charging behavior even with limited labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PEV load identification method achieves an identification accuracy exceeding 90% across various simulated and real datasets. Compared to existing methods, the proposed model shows significant improvement and robust performance, even when applied to datasets with limited labels and poor quality. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Joint training; limited labeled samples; load identification; multiattention (MA) mechanism; plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)","Electric power plant loads; Labeled data; Implicit features; Joint training; Large-scales; Limited labeled sample; Load identification; Multiattention mechanism; Plug-in vehicles; Plug-ins; Scale integration; Vehicle load; Plug-in electric vehicles","Rdve 6 February 2025; visedre 13 April 2025; accepted 20 May 2025.

To mitigate operational instability risks induced by uncoordinated large-scale EV charging integration in microgrids in urban and built-up areas, this study proposes a hierarchical two-layer optimization framework for power management in high-penetration EV-grid scenarios. The upper-layer of the hierarchical two-layer optimization framework model focuses on EV-related objectives, incorporating constraints, battery depreciation costs, and user satisfaction into the objective function. The lower-layer model includes microgrid components: photovoltaic units, wind turbines, micro wind turbines, and diesel engines. The aim is to minimize operational costs and load variance within the microgrid, thereby enhancing the power grid stability. To solve this model effectively, a hybrid optimization algorithm combining an improved sparrow search algorithm with a neural network is proposed, and the algorithm is benchmarked and validated against three meta-heuristic optimization algorithms for its efficacy. The study evaluates the scheduling outcomes under three distinct EV strategies, and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the model.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a customer segmentation-based approach for optimal charger distribution to assist policymakers and distribution network operators in the early stages of EV adoption. This work comprises two main parts: representing plugin behaviors through customer segmentation and optimal charger allocation in community distribution networks. Customer segmentation is conducted using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, with EV adoption features selected based on their importance scores using regional EV availability. Primary plugin behaviors, based on Australian contexts, consider arrival time, charger preferences, driving patterns, and initial state of charge, while secondary behaviors, such as plugin intervals and energy needs, are modeled using probabilistic simulations. Utilizing secondary plugin variables, this research employs a two-stage multi-objective optimization approach to find optimal locations and sizes of community chargers in the IEEE-33 bus system coupled with a road network.

This transition not only increases the difficulty of effectively classifying distribution networks due to their heightened complexity but also renders traditional energy management approaches—primarily focused on economic objectives—insufficient to meet the growing demands for flexible scheduling and dynamic response. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an adaptive multi-objective energy management strategy that accounts for the distinct operational requirements of distribution networks with a high penetration of new-type source-loads. The goal is to establish a comprehensive energy management framework that optimally balances energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and economic performance in modern distribution networks. To enhance classification accuracy, the strategy constructs a multi-dimensional scenario classification model that integrates environmental and climatic factors by analyzing the operational characteristics of new-type distribution networks and incorporating expert knowledge. An improved split-coupling K-means pre-clustering algorithm is employed to classify distribution networks effectively. Based on the classification results, fuzzy logic control is then utilized to dynamically optimize the weighting of each objective, allowing for an adaptive adjust-ment of priorities to achieve a flexible and responsive multi-objective energy management strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through practical case studies. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy by 18.18% compared to traditional classification methods and enhances energy savings and carbon reduction by 4.34% and 20.94%, respectively, compared to the fixed-weight strategy. © 2025 The Authors.

However, challenges such as limited capacity and stability constraints hinder the widespread adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs). Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) enhance market participation by aggregating DERs, while electric vehicles (EVs) contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing emissions. Additionally, integrating distribution static compensators (DSTATCOMs) within VPPs improves microgrid stability and reactive power support. This study proposes a two-stage optimization approach to enhance network resilience and VPP profitability in a radial distribution network (RDN). The first stage focuses on minimizing resilience-related costs and energy not supplied (ENS) during natural disasters, while the second stage optimizes VPP profit using a three-phase bidding strategy, which includes the day-ahead market, real-time market, and overall market. A hybrid improved grey wolf optimization-particle swarm optimization (IGWO-PSO) algorithm is developed to solve this complex optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, IGWO-PSO is compared with other hybrid optimization algorithms. Validation on a modified IEEE 33-bus RDN confirms that the proposed model enhances VPP placement and sizing, leading to improved economic, operational, and resilience metrics. Furthermore, the model accounts for uncertainties in load demand, renewable generation, energy prices, and equipment availability, ensuring a robust and adaptable energy management strategy. © 2013 IEEE.","hybrid IGWO-PSO algorithm; microgrids; radial distribution network; resilience; Virtual power plant; VPP profit","Distributed Wind; Nonprofit organization; Gray wolves; Hybrid improved gray wolf optimization-particle swarm optimization algorithm; Microgrid; Optimisations; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Radial distribution networks; Resilience; Virtual power plant profit; Virtual power plants; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","This work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI under Grant JP23K03821.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004035830"

While distributed renewable energy sources (DERES) reduce grid strain, EV charging requires strategic planning. To optimize the power distribution and address consumption variability, a novel two-phase coordination mechanism is proposed, combining statistical methods and game theory. A deep convolutional neural system (DCNS) and a Nash equilibrium-based game strategy manage this complex, uncooperative energy structure. The first phase determines the optimal electricity distribution among DSES components like solar plants, BESD, and EVs. The second phase ensures efficient power delivery to EVs based on these distributions. By leveraging deep neural networks for demand variability management, the approach considers factors such as power needs and driver preferences. The proposed method was validated through rigorous modeling and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) experiments, demonstrating superior performance over benchmark techniques.

This, however, requires distribution companies to run power flow analyses and, therefore, to have adequate three-phase LV network models. Although, in practice, these models are often inaccurate or do not exist, the growing adoption of smart meters around the world brings about new opportunities. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to construct a three-phase LV network model solely exploiting real smart meter data. Two multiple linear regression models combined with clustering techniques and Spearman correlation are employed to identify the network topology, line impedance, and phase groups. The proposed approach is tested on a real LV network (14 customers) from Victoria, Australia, and a set of 60 days of real smart meter data (V, I) with 5-min resolution. Results demonstrate that the construction of the LV network model can be done with a mean error of ±1 Volts (measurements vs power flow simulations).

The ring seal search (RSS) algorithm ensures the optimum compatibility of the EV charging and discharging profiles revolving around multiple objectives, such as cost of charging, peak load demand reduction, and grid stability. The proposed algorithm is tested on the distribution model through the IEEE 33-bus system. A comprehensive model with real-time data from EV charging station operators (CSOs) is also ported in this research so that the EVs can be illustrated in the power distribution network. A convenient energy management strategy (EMS) called multiobjective optimization has been introduced to provide practical solutions for CSOs and EV users. The strategy had been developed based on multiple objectives to counter different trade-offs, including EV charging and discharging profiles suitable for numerous objectives encompassing charging costs, peak load demand reduction, and grid stability. The efficiency of the deterministic approach has been verified via extensive simulations and analysis, and the outcomes incorporate a definite enhancement in metrics since the RSS algorithm considerably optimized EV charging and V2G scheduling. The EV charging and discharging profiles had been optimized to take better advantage of available resource requirements by accommodating priority-based scheduling. The RSS will be able to investigate the modified parameter and the modified real system, which tells about the versatility and adaptability of the proposed method, i.e., it will be able to incorporate the changing implementation and its real-world efficacy, which is an immense merit for the adaptation of the real system. The proposed method offers a comprehensive, advanced EV charging and V2G scheduling solution. It addresses the limitations of previous methods by considering multiple objectives, utilizing a novel optimization algorithm, handling uncertainties, promoting renewable energy integration, and providing ancillary grid support.

Renewable energy (mainly wind and solar) is intermittent and non-dispatchable. The aggregator of available energy storage systems and controllable loads, including heating, cooling, EV charging/discharging, etc., can mitigate those issues in the VPP framework and maintain system balance. The VVP platform's wind speed, solar radiation, and load demand are highly dynamic. Without intelligent coordination, it is impossible to determine the optimal size of the resources with minimum operation cost. An overestimate of resources suffers from unnecessary excess capital cost, which might not be feasible. On the other hand, an underestimate of resources builds an unreliable VPP. It is a multi-objective complex problem considering the minimization of capital and operation costs as objectives, subject to many constraints, including net zero emission. Moreover, an intelligent energy management system (EMS) is deployed considering present and near future dynamic forecasted demand profile, state of charge (SoC) of storage, and power availability from renewables for reliability, and maintains net zero energy and emission. All the dispatch and transaction communications in VPP are committed to using blockchain. This paper uses an intelligent multi-objective strategy to design and optimize a generalized VPP model. Historical wind speed, solar radiation, and load profiles over a long period are used as inputs for the model. An intelligent energy management system for the dispatch of resources is carried out. Results will show that the proposed method can build an effective VPP considering costs, emissions, efficiency, and reliability. © 2013 IEEE.","","Capitals costs; Intelligent energy management systems; Operations cost; Optimum operations; Plant operations; Plant optimization; Solar load; Virtual power plants; Wind speed; Zero emission; Costs","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003038244"

Utilities must expand hosting capacity for these distributed energy resources (DERs) while ensuring grid reliability. Traditional planning approaches often struggle with the probabilistic nature of DER adoption and the computational burden of Monte Carlo-based simulations. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic framework for hosting capacity assessment, eliminating the need for Monte Carlo simulations while improving accuracy and efficiency. We formulate hosting capacity as an optimization problem that accounts for DER adoption uncertainty and grid reliability constraints. Our method determines PV and EV hosting capacities under different confidence levels and identifies optimal non-wires alternatives (NWAs), such as BESS, to enhance grid capacity. Our findings reveal that the proposed method provides more reliable hosting capacity estimates with significantly reduced computational time compared to traditional approaches. Additionally, our co-optimization framework enables utilities to strategically balance NWAs and conventional grid upgrades. These methodologies offer a robust foundation for utilities and regulators to quantify electrification-related grid costs and guide strategic investment decisions. © 2013 IEEE.","","Battery energy storage systems; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy systems; Grid reliability; Hosting capacity; Photovoltaic systems; Probabilistics; Traditional planning; Vehicle energy; Virtual power plants","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003035717"

Electric vehicle chargers integrate with distribution networks via power electronic interfaces, offering significant control and operational flexibility. The industry is quickly adapting to this rapidly emerging load type, and now requires a robust means for understanding their impact on power system operations. This paper presents a modeling approach to capture the aggregate dynamic impact of these chargers on the power system in response to a range of network fault conditions. Six commonly available electric vehicles were empirically tested under various supply disturbances using a grid simulator, and their fault ride-through performances have been characterised. The undervoltage withstand capability of the six vehicles varied considerably, with fault voltage thresholds ranging between 0.3 and 0.7 pu leading to electric vehicles either ceasing charging for between ∼2 and 10 seconds, or locking out completely. A composite dynamic load model for electric vehicles was developed and validated, employing the collected empirical data. The validation process demonstrated the aggregate load model's capability to accurately capture the resulting load deficit owing to electric vehicle fault ride-through in response to transmission-level faults. The proposed model is suitable for application in wide-area power system studies to enhance the accuracy of simulated network load response for frequency assessments, operations planning, and other system analyses. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","aggregate load model; distributed energy resources; Electric vehicles; fault ride-through; power system modeling; power system stability; practical testing; voltage sags","Aggregate load model; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric vehicles chargers; Fault ride-through; Power system fault; Power system modeling; Power systems stability; Practical testing; Testing and modeling; Voltage sags; Power distribution faults","The authors are grateful for the support and encouragement given by the directors and management of Tasmanian Networks Pty.

This paper develops an electric vehicle load model considering diverse charging station locations, EV types, and drivers' behavior. Also, the proposed method integrates the uncertainty of PV generation through interval prediction utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors regressor. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze the impact of PV interval (forecasted lower and upper generation profile), EV load (hourly and peak), line failures, and demographic characteristics associated with EV on power system reliability. The reliability assessment is extended to sensitivity analysis and evaluation of the impact of EV loads and PV generation profiles on the capacity value of PV generators with different capacities, utilizing the Discrete Convolution approach. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the IEEE Reliability Test System and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in determining the reliability of the power system by explicitly accommodating PV uncertainties and the intricacies of EVs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Composite reliability; electric vehicle (EV); photovoltaic (PV); uncertainty","Charging stations; Composite Reliability; Energy; Photovoltaics; Photovoltaics generations; Power; Power systems reliability; Reliability assessments; Sustainable energy; Uncertainty; Vehicle load; Sensitivity analysis","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant NSF 1847578.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002401321"

In the present context, implementing intelligent charging systems for electric vehicles and integrating vehicle-to-grid technology are viable approaches to attain economic, technical skills, and environmental advantages. The successful deployment of these innovations necessitates collaboration among various stakeholders, including the electricity end-user, the owner of electric vehicles, the method operator, and legislators. The article proposes applying multi-objective techno-economic-environmental optimization in planning electric vehicle charging and discharging. This research shows a novel approach called the Innovative Energy Distribution Method for Electric Vehicles (IEDM-EV), which aims to achieve the optimal incorporation of plug-in electric vehicles (PIEV) into the distribution structure. The proposed approach encompasses two optimization layers that address the administration of real and reactive energy in PIEV. These optimization layers are implemented at both the nodal and system levels. The initial optimizing coating for energy management is formulated with a focus on the nodal aggregator’s viewpoint to minimize the overall daily cost associated with the (dis)charging of PIEV. The second optimizing layer for reactive energy control was formulated from the perspective of the distribution operator. The findings indicated that the proposed approach mitigates various factors, including energy expenditure, battery deterioration, carbon dioxide emissions, and grid utilization of 88.2%, 67%, 34%, and 90%, respectively. The simulation findings demonstrate that utilizing reactive electrical services offered by PIEV enables the suggested way to achieve voltage regulation.

Power-to-hydrogen (P2H2) technology has been instrumental in enabling this transition. To further enhance the efficiency and reliability of MEMG systems, a network structure known as a multi-microgrid (MMG) has emerged.

Therefore, it is imperative to accelerate the construction of related facilities for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS). However, the unplanned and random location of EVCS can result in high investment costs, prolonged user queuing times, and a decrease in grid stability. To tackle these challenges, this work presents a multi-objective planning model for EVCS based on the spatial-temporal distribution of EV charging demand and traffic-grid coupling. First, a real-time traffic model is developed using the actual road network to simulate EV moving patterns. Then, the planning region is partitioned by analyzing point of interest data. Finally, an optimal EVCS planning model is designed with the objective of minimizing total costs, user dissatisfaction, and voltage fluctuations, based on predictions of charging demand considering both spatial and temporal variations. The proposed model is applied to the Kunming second ring road area and is solved using the multi-objective thermal exchange optimization (MOTEO) algorithm.

This trend results in the decline of system inertia and thus raises the frequency secure issue. Concurrently, electric vehicles (EVs) proliferate. Numerous EVs hold a huge potential of frequency regulation in case of contingency as EVs are able to achieve primary frequency responses (PFRs) via vehicle to grid chargers. However, the value of frequency responses from aggregated EVs has not fully exploited. This paper, proposes a chance constrained scheduling model incorporating the ability of PFRs from aggregated EVs. The proposed model characterizes uncertainties associated PFR capacities from aggregated EVs and wind power forecast errors by the Wasserstein-metric ambiguity sets, which do not rely on distributional assumption, and then formulates uncertainties-related constraints as distributionally robust (DR) chance constraints. These DR chance constraints are reformulated as tractable linear programs. Consequently, the proposed model leads to a mixed-integer linear program. Numerical results on a modified IEEE 39-bus system show that incorporating PFR from EVs can reduce total costs from $4,540,396 to $4,431,233, which is reduced by 2.4%. The proposed model also achieves better reliability compared to traditional methods, demonstrating the distributionally robust optimization in enhancing electricity scheduling and rising renewable integration. © 2024 The Author(s).

Simultaneously, the Distribution Network (DN) encounters escalating challenges in meeting charging demand during peak traffic periods. Consequently, there is a mounting demand for the deployment of innovative Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies to augment the DN's flexibility in power dispatch and alleviate travel costs for EV users. Hence, this paper proposes an EV-user-equilibrium-(UE)-constrained V2G planning framework that enhances flexibility in the DN. The framework aims to ascertain the optimal placement and capacity of EV charging stations (EVCSs) and V2G charging piles within the Transportation Network (TN). It takes into account the equilibrium condition stemming from competitive EV charging and routing behaviors alongside the optimal expansion of DN energy resources to accommodate the electricity supplied by the V2G piles. This study commences by analyzing EV drivers’ travel decisions, considering the influence of charging and V2G pile locations and sizes. Subsequently, we tackle the Traffic Assignment Problem with User Equilibrium (TAP-UE) model to characterize the steady-state traffic flow distribution of EVs. Following this, we formulate the optimization model for the Coordinated Power and Transportation Network (CPTN), which encompasses the optimal expansion of DN facilities and traffic flow regulation under UE conditions. To mitigate the computational complexity associated with the V2G planning model, we introduce a series of linearization methods to obtain a manageable Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solution. Finally, to validate the efficacy of our proposed planning framework, we apply it to two test systems, including a real-world case study.

Integrating EVs into distribution networks can enhance voltage profile stability. However, unplanned EV connection and charging can lead to increased peak load power consumption, voltage profile irregularities, and heightened network losses. Addressing the placement of charging stations in distribution networks is crucial to prevent voltage drop crises and mitigate other issues. This study proposes a Bi-level particle programming optimization programming approach, utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to minimize losses and determine optimal station locations. The algorithm iteratively minimizes losses while considering location and operating costs until a stopping condition is met. Additionally, an EV charging planning algorithm is introduced to manage EV connections without exacerbating peak load or causing severe voltage drops. Simulations conducted on an IEEE 33-bus system using MATLAB analyze the proposed design's impact on power consumption, system losses, and network voltage. Simulations in an IEEE 33-bus system show that the proposed model shifts peak power consumption by about 4.6 % to about 11.6 % under different EV penetration scenarios. It achieves a reduction in the network losses by up to 0.39 %, while the voltage deviations in critical buses are minimized to enhance stability during periods of high demand for EVs. Results demonstrate that the programmed charging algorithm effectively reduces power consumption at peak load, minimizes network losses, and smooths the daily voltage profile. © 2024","Bi-level optimization; Charging planning algorithm; Distribution network; Distribution network losses; Electric vehicles (EVs)","DC distribution systems; MATLAB; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power distribution networks; Power distribution planning; Bi-level optimization; Bus systems; Charging planning algorithm; Distribution network loss; Electric vehicle; Network loss; Peak load; Planning algorithms; Voltage drop; Voltage profile; Charging stations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211242486"

This article proposes an innovative collaborative planning framework for electric vehicle integrated charging and swapping stations (EVICSS) and DN for carbon emission reduction. Initially, the division of responsibilities and mechanism analysis for emission reduction in DN are presented. Subsequently, the ladder carbon price model is presented to incentivize carbon mitigation efforts. And, considering the architecture and functioning mode of the EVICSS, the operational model for EVICSS equipment is established to deliver high-quality services to EV users, taking into account fast charging stations (FCS), fast battery swapping stations (FBSS), and cascade energy storage system (CESS) comprehensively. Taking into account the economic implications of carbon trading, a collaborative planning strategy for EVICSS and the DN is formulated to minimize overall costs while maximizing carbon emission reductions. Then an modified integrated gravitational search algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm (MIGSA-PSOA) is customizedly developed to solve this complicated optimization problem. Finally, case studies based a real DN are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the collaborative planning model. The results demonstrated it can effectively respond to DN power regulation and realize carbon emission reduction. Compared with independent planning, collaborative planning can increase the planning cost and total cost to 15.6 % and 33.1 % respectively. © 2024","Collaborative planning; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle integrated charging and swapping stations; Gravitational search algorithm; Low carbon; Particle swarm optimization algorithm","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power distribution planning; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon reduction potentials; Collaborative planning; Electric vehicle integrated charging and swapping station; Electric vehicle integrations; Gravitational search algorithm; Low carbon; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Search Algorithms; Charging stations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210028008"

Condition construction will inevitably lead to information loss, and traditional design methods require high computational power and encounter a time disaster during the real-world condition data explosion. This study proposes a condition representation method with driving condition frequency distribution characteristics (DCFDCs) and an optimal energy consumption calculation method, that is, instantaneous battery energy balance solution and global battery energy balance correction (IBGB–GBEB) with DCFDCs. The energy consumption calculation results show that the proposed optimal energy consumption method can guarantee the accuracy of the energy consumption calculation and reduce the calculation time cost. The difference in fuel consumption between the optimal energy consumption method and the dynamic planning (DP) algorithm is only 2.50%, but the difference in the calculation time between the two methods is 87.00%. Furthermore, the practical example of hybrid power system (HPS) design parameter optimisation shows that the energy consumption calculation results obtained by the TDCR–DP and DCFDCs–MIGA methods are consistent, and the relative error is only 1.81%. However, the calculation time of the TDCR–DP method is 472 h, whereas that of the DCFDC–MIGA method is only 2.17 h, which is a calculation time reduction of more than 99.54%. The results highlight the effectiveness and time advantage of the optimal energy consumption calculation method with DCFDCs.

In this research, gradual decarbonization, using different hybrid, electric and hydrogen technologies for decarbonization of fleets engaged in activities such as fishery, passenger transport and transport of goods near the coast is investigated and modelled in connection to the power systems’ configuration. The energy system analysis and simulations are carried out in H2RES, a linear energy systems’ configuration optimization software. It considers capacity expansion, decommission and unit commitment in the sectors of power generation, heating, industry, and transport. In this particular case, transport sector module is expanded to provide realistic modelling of different naval fleets’ energy consumption, on the example of fishery fleet. This is performed through the inclusion of learning curves of different technologies that are expected in the naval transport, to replace the old internal combustion engine power drives and the demand curves that characterize the fishery fleet.

This approach gives optimal placement and sizes for DGs and DSTATCOMs as well as a number of electric vehicles (EVs) that can be charged at the EVCSs by considering the network reconfiguration (NR). The optimal allocation of EVCSs fulfills the power demand from EVs at various locations and minimizes the negative impact on the power network. The RE-based DGs considered for this work are solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind. The uncertainties related to RE-based DGs and EVCSs have been modeled by using the probabilistic-based two-point estimate method (2PEM). The best locations and sizes are identified by optimizing the individual objectives that is active power losses and voltage stability index (VSI) using the teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. Then both objectives are optimized by using the non-dominated sorting-based TLBO algorithm. Furthermore, the optimal planning approach is implemented on IEEE 33 and 69 bus test systems to demonstrate the suitability, practicality, and efficiency of the proposed optimal planning strategy.

Existing charging stations often encounter issues such as unstable PV power generation and dependence on grid stability, which can interrupt the EV charging process during grid faults. Additionally, PV arrays are typically designed to extract maximum power, leading to over-current or over-voltage situations that compromise the safety of the charging infrastructure and the EV. Furthermore, these systems often require multiple power electronics converters, increasing complexity and costs while reducing overall system efficiency. To overcome these limitations, the proposed algorithm dynamically switches between on-grid and off-grid modes based on real-time weather conditions, grid availability, and the state of charge of the battery electric vehicle (BEV). This approach maximizes PV power utilization, minimizes grid dependency, and enhances BEV charging performance while prioritizing EV safety and ensuring an uninterrupted power supply. It also provides flexibility in BEV power sizing, optimizing the use of power electronics converters to reduce costs and complexity. Two distinct operating modes, adaptive charging and fast charging, are introduced, each integrated with dedicated model predictive controllers (MPC) to achieve specific control objectives. Semi-experimental simulations using a process-in-the-loop (PIL) test approach with the embedded board eZdsp TMS320F28335 demonstrate that the station manager significantly improves performance over conventional methods under various irradiance levels. Moreover, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MPC-based approach over traditional controllers such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) in different charging modes. For instance, the MPC controller achieved an Integral Absolute Error (IAE) of 11.45%, lower than that of the PID controller, and 4.3% lower than the SMC controller. © 2024 The Authors","Electric vehicle charging station; eZdsp TMS320F28335; Li-ion battery; MPC; MPPT; PIL; PV power; Station manager","Adaptive control systems; Battery management systems; Electric circuit breakers; Fast charging (Batteries); Invariance; Nuclear batteries; Orbital laboratories; Power management (telecommunication); Predictive control systems; State of charge; Static Var compensators; Time switches; Uninterruptible power systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; EV Charging; Ezdsp tms320f28335; Ion batteries; Model predictive controllers; Power; Process-in-the-loop; Station manager; Charging stations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207042704"

This study aims to bridge the research gap by studying EV charging behaviours and their capacity for electricity balancing and delivery. Using data from 179,665 real-world charging sessions in Sweden, we employed statistical and clustering analysis to scrutinize charging behaviours comprehensively. Synthetic weekly charging load profiles are generated for both residential areas and workplaces, considering varying charging power levels, which can be used as inputs for large-scale EV charging load modelling.

Results show that EVs exhibit significant potential for electricity balancing (up to 51.5 kWh daily).

EVs as a random load may take a toll on the stability and reliability of the power system. However, they can also help to improve the grid performance if operated in coordination with the load profile. In this paper, the impact of EV fleet integration in the unbalanced distribution network has been observed. A probabilistic EV model for charging and discharging of EVs is proposed, in which both the arrival and departure time of EVs is modelled as a normal distribution and the distance travelled is modelled as a lognormal distribution taking into account the spatial temporal features of EV charging. The charging-discharging schedule of EVs is optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the aim of obtaining a flattened load profile. The developed algorithm was tested on IEEE 13-bus unbalanced test distribution network, and the results show that the optimized EV integration has resulted in flattening the load profile (gap between maximum and minimum demand reduced to ~ 18 kW), improvement in the voltage profile and reduction in the network unbalance as depicted by the decrease in the maximum neutral current drawn (~ 28%). The proposed model can be implemented for practical distribution system planning and can be an effective tool in balancing the unbalanced network in the era of rapidly increasing EVs in the real-time distribution system. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Electric vehicle; Genetic algorithm; Load curve flattening; Neutral current; Probabilistic modelling; Unbalanced distribution system","Fleet operations; Fleet integration; Load curve flattening; Load curves; Load profiles; Neutral currents; Optimisations; Probabilistic models; Probabilistics; Unbalanced distribution systems; Vehicle fleets; DC distribution systems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203368130"

While EV drivers are indispensable components for the V2G applications, the extant power system studies have underexamined the willingness of EV drivers to participate in V2G. In addition, few studies investigate whether the small-scale and time-varying V2G supply can replace utility-level energy storage. Given this background, this study combined discrete choice experiments with energy storage capacity expansion planning (ES-CEP) to simulate time-varying V2G participation and effectiveness. The choice experiments identified drivers’ preferences for V2G, which was used to simulate V2G participation under different compensation schemes. Time-varying V2G participation was integrated into ES-CEP for renewable-dominant power system to assess the potential of V2G to replace ES at the utility scale. The results showed that most drivers were unlikely to engage in V2G, although this reluctance decreased during the night. Higher guaranteed state-of-charge, accessible V2G facilities, and monetary enrollment compensation encouraged the participation. The ES-CEP results showed that, even with a limited V2G (4.5–15.3 % of EV drivers), V2G significantly reduced the optimal ES capacity (36.5–45.6 % for power and 39.6–60.6 % for energy), shaved peak netload by 18.5 %, and saved the total cost by 3.35 %, even after accounting for V2G enrollment compensation and battery degradation. EVs that charged during the daytime and participated in V2G at night were the most utilized, resulting in 0.92 % of annual battery aging, but generated a profit of 636,749 KRW (553 USD). The findings of this study underscore the importance of a suitable compensation scheme for V2G and supplementary measures for incentivizing EV charging during off-peak hours, as these elements are essential for the successful implementation of V2G. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity expansion planning; Discrete choice experiments; Electric vehicle; Energy storage; Optimization; Vehicle-to-grid","State of charge; Capacity expansion planning; Discrete choice experiments; Energy; Energy storage capacity; Optimisations; Power; Renewables; Time varying; Vehicle drivers; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid; alternative energy; discrete choice analysis; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy storage; integrated approach; optimization","This work was supported by the Korea Electric Power Corporation; Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the \u2018Climate Change R&D Project for New Climate Regime\u2019 funded by the Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) (No. RS-2022-KE002473); and supported by the research work (No. RR2023-06), funded by Korea Environment Institute (KEI).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204467648"

Additionally, the electrification of the automotive sector, aimed at reducing pollution, is driving a rapid increase in electric vehicles (EVs). A critical element of this transition is the development of efficient infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicle parking lots (PEV-PLs). A collaborative planning model is essential to address the impact of integrating RESs and PEV-PLs into the electric power distribution system (DS) over the long term. This paper introduces a long-term mixed-integer non-linear (MINL) optimization planning model designed to optimize the planning and operation of RESs, including wind and PV sources, alongside PEV-PLs infrastructure. The goal is to increase the penetration of renewable energy and EVs within the DS while adhering to security constraints. The optimization model features three non-linear, incompatible objective functions: minimizing overall strategic expected investment, maintenance, emission, and operational costs; long-term power loss; and voltage deviation. Moreover, to ensure realism, the model incorporates uncertainties related to stochastic variables such as the intermittent nature of RESs, EV energy and time variables, loads, and energy price fluctuations, using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and the backward reduction method (BRM). A hybrid optimization algorithm addresses the proposed objectives, combining the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) to minimize the three distinct objective functions concurrently. The effectiveness of the planning model is validated using the 69-bus benchmark test system, with four configurations tested: case 1 (the base case), case 2 (the base case with RESs (wind and PV)), case 3 (the base case with RESs and PEV-PLs), and case 4 (the base case with RESs, PEV-PLs, and a higher number of EVs). The impact of RESs on DS operation, PEV-PLs on RES penetration levels and DS operation, and the effect of increased EV penetration on the integrated capacity of RESs and DS operation are thoroughly investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal integration of 5 PEV-PLs, accommodating a fleet of 107 PEVs with wind and PV DGs, increases the RES penetration level from 3.35 MVA to 3.85 MVA compared to the case with RESs alone. Moreover, integrating PEV-PLs with RESs results in a 51.00 % reduction in overall operational costs, a 37.55 % reduction in overall planning and operation costs, a 52.82 % reduction in total carbon emissions, and a 45.85 % reduction in total voltage deviation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed generations (DGs); Electric vehicles (EVs); Long term planning model; Metaheuristic optimization technique; Plug in electric vehicles parking lots (PEV-PL); Renewable energy sources (RESs); Uncertainty modeling","Air cushion vehicles; Air quality; Benchmarking; Distributed energy; Distributed power generation; Geophysical prospecting; Integer programming; Light pulse generators; Linear programming; Phosphate deposits; Plug-in electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Renewable energy; Stochastic models; Surface water resources; Surface waters; Tabu search; Distributed generation; Electric vehicle; Long term planning; Long term planning model; Meta-heuristic optimization techniques; Parking lots; Planning models; Plug in electric vehicle parking lot; Plug-ins; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty models; Vehicle parking; Solar power generation","This work was supported by UNITEN through Postdoctoral Fellowships under project code J510050002 , the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia through Fundamental Research Grant (FRGS) under project code FRGS/1/2020/TK0/UNITEN/02/2 , and the Emirates Centre for Mobility Research (ECMR) at UAE, University Under Grant 12R202 .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206171317"

To promote greener EV charging practices, this study proposes the environmental time-of-use (E-ToU) which provides time-varying prices and GHG intensity signals. Specifically, in E-ToU, GHG intensity is used as a nudge to steer drivers’ charging behavior, providing a mixed financial-environmental incentive. Conjoint-based choice experiments were conducted with participation of 1220 South Korean drivers (including 129 EV owners) to simulate EV charging under this novel scheme. Unit commitment was utilized to determine time-varying prices and GHG intensity, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of E-ToU. The results indicated that both charging costs and GHG intensity influenced the charging decisions (timing) of EV users. The E-ToU shifted EV charging to renewable-abundant daytime, reducing EV charging costs by 14.1 % and GHG emission from EV charging by 15.7 %. Additionally, it reduced the generation costs by 2.2 %, GHG emissions by 1.5 %, and renewable energy curtailments by 2.5 % in the power system. Notably, E-ToU outperformed flat-rate/ToU with respect to all evaluated metrics, highlighting its effectiveness.

EH outputs, addressing electricity and heat needs, are managed via battery storage systems (BSS) and electric vehicle (EV) fleets in regulation markets. The energy hub operator optimizes decisions concerning natural gas and energy, minimizing costs in electricity supply and thermal energy carriers across day-ahead (DA) markets and regulations. Emphasizing the benefits of demand-side management planning in cost reduction, the model incorporates a conditional value at risk (CVaR) method to assess and manage uncertainties. Moreover, leveraging electric vehicle battery storage capacity is explored to mitigate wind and solar energy production uncertainties. An energy optimization strategy based on a Multi-Objective Wind-Driven Optimization (MOWDO) is proposed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model and method across various system conditions and scenarios.

The proliferation of these mobility modes will be accompanied by the massive installation of charging and refilling infrastructures into existing networks. This work focuses on fuel-cell vehicles, for which refilling points are needed. Difficulties in hydrogen transportation can be circumvented by deploying onsite hydrogen generation assets (electrolysers) and storage, which can be partially or fully supplied through local renewable generators. Nevertheless, such assets require a considerable initial investment, being necessary the use of planning tools in order to maximize revenues for private investors. This paper focuses on this issue. In particular, an optimal sitting and sizing tool for hydrogen refilling stations with onsite storage and electrolysers is developed. The developed methodology considers the influence of locational marginal prices, which are cleared by the distribution system operator in order to translate the real electricity cost per node. This pricing strategy helps to best allocate assets through the network and thus resulting valuable for planners in order to site refilling infrastructures properly. An original multi-year iterative algorithm based on the multi-cut Benders' decomposition is proposed in order to alleviate the intrinsic high computational cost of the planning tool while accommodate long-term inflation and degradation rates of parameters. A number of simulations are performed on the well-known IEEE 33-bus system. Results verify that locational marginal pricing effectively translates the nodal electricity cost to end-users. Remark, the total electrolysis capacity turns out to be the most significant parameter, reducing further the cost of the project, while storage capacity has a limited influence. Results highlight the importance of the infrastructure capacity when determining the placement and sizing of electrolysers, thus supporting decisions when upgrading existing infrastructure. The impact of the number of stations to be installed and the budget cap is also analysed, showing that both parameters have similar influence and may reduce the total project cost by 70% approximately. The typical scheduling behaviour of the electrolysis-storage facilities is discussed, showing how storage is capable to provide energy arbitrage exploiting locational marginal prices. Finally, the computational performance of the developed algorithm is assessed, verifying that the new tool is efficient and portable. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Electrolysis; Fuel-cell vehicles; Hydrogen storage; Locational marginal pricing","Computational efficiency; Cost reduction; Degradation; Electrolysis; Fuel cells; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Iterative methods; Location; Vehicles; Decarbonisation; Electricity costs; Electrolysers; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Fuel cell vehicles; Generation assets; Hydrogen generations; Locational marginal prices; Locational marginal pricing; Planning tools; Electric power distribution; atmospheric electricity; decomposition analysis; distribution system; electricity generation; electrokinesis; installation","This work was partially supported by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00F3n, Agencia Estatal de Investigaci\u00F3n, and Uni\u00F3n Europea (Grants TED2021-129631B-C32 and TED2021-129631B-C31 supported by MCIN/AEI/ 10.13039/501100011033 and NextGenerationEU/PRTR).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200154656"

The analysis reveals that the PV-STHS-LTHS configuration, reduces total planning costs by 12% and 15% as compared to the base case in the 33-bus and 51-bus systems, respectively. Additionally, the integration of both daily and seasonal storage facilities with PV systems leads to a reduction in carbon emissions by 76% and 81% in the 33-bus and 51-bus systems, respectively. Besides the carbon reduction, the incorporation of daily and cross-seasonal H<inf>2</inf> storage increases oxygen release into the environment by 13% for the 33-bus system and 15% for the 51-bus system. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Distribution network; Electric vehicle; Green hydrogen; IHHO algorithm; Optimal planning; Seasonal hydrogen storage","Buses; DC distribution systems; Electrolytic cells; Hydrogen storage; Power distribution planning; Uninterruptible power systems; Bus systems; Carbon emissions; Charging station; Coordinated operation; Coordinated planning; Green hydrogen; IHHO algorithm; Optimal planning; Photovoltaics; Seasonal hydrogen storage; Charging stations","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205442842"

Traditional deterministic methods fail to handle qualitative fuzziness (e.g., subjective reliability thresholds) and quantitative uncertainty (e.g., sparse historical data), leading to inflexible and inefficient solutions. This study addresses these challenges by developing a hybrid planning framework. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to solve the dual challenges of qualitative fuzziness and quantitative uncertainty in distribution network planning, providing a systematic solution to accommodate distributed renewable energy, handle load uncertainty, and balance conflicting stakeholder preferences through integrating fuzzy optimization theory and grey system theory. METHODS: The hybrid algorithm combines fuzzy optimization and grey system theory. Fuzzy optimization uses triangular fuzzy numbers for load growth rates ([3%, 5%, 8%]) and trapezoidal fuzzy intervals for voltage constraints ([−10%, −5%, 5%, 10%]) with membership functions (threshold λ≥0.8) to convert qualitative requirements into solvable constraints. Grey system theory applies the GM(1,1) model for load forecasting (achieving 4.2% MAPE with 15-month data) and grey relational analysis (GRA) for data-driven objective weighting to eliminate expert bias. An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is used for optimization, validated in a 33-node network with 8.5 MW PV and 6 MW wind capacity. RESULTS: In the 33-node case study, compared to the deterministic genetic algorithm (D-GA), the hybrid algorithm reduces lifecycle costs by 19% (from $8.91M to $7.23M), increases renewable energy accommodation by 24% (from 9.8 MW to 12.3 MW), and improves the system average supply availability index (ASAI) from 99.92% to 99.95%. Under extreme uncertainties (±40% renewable output, ±30% load shifts), cost deviations remain within 6% and reliability metrics within 5%, demonstrating strong robustness. CONCLUSION: This research presents a robust hybrid framework that bridges fuzzy qualitative reasoning and grey data efficiency, effectively addressing both qualitative fuzziness and quantitative uncertainty in distribution network planning. It provides a science-based tool for resilient grid design, with potential for extension to multi-energy system integration and real-time optimization in future work. © © 2025 Jinsen Liu et al., licensed to EAI.

The lack of sufficient numbers of CPs has hindered EV adoption and negatively impacted the progress of sustainable mobility. We propose a CP distribution algorithm that is machine learning-based and leverages population density, points of interest (POIs), and the most used roads as input parameters to determine the best locations for deploying CPs. The objects of the following research are as follows: (1) to allocate weights to the three parameters in a 6 km by 10 km grid size scenario in Dublin in Ireland so that the best CP distribution is obtained; (2) to use a feedforward neural network (FNNs) model to predict the best parameter weight combinations and the corresponding CPs. CP deployment solutions are classified as successful when an EV is located within 100 m of a CP at the end of a trip. We find that (1) integrating the GEECharge and EV Portacharge algorithms with FNNs optimises the distribution of CPs; (2) the normalised optimal weights for the population density, POIs, and most used road parameters determined by this approach result in approximately 109 CPs being allocated in Dublin; (3) resizing the grid from 6 km by 10 km to 10 km by 6 km and rotating it at an angle of (Formula presented.) results in a 5.7% rise in the overall number of CPs in Dublin; (4) reducing the grid cell size from 1 km2 to 500 m2 reduces the mean distance between CPs and the EVs. This research is vital to city planners as we show that city planners can use readily available data to generate these parameters for urban planning decisions that result in EV CP networks, which have increased efficiency. This will promote EV usage in urban transportation, leading to greater sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.","charging infrastructure optimisation; charging point placement strategies; electric vehicle charging points; EV charging demand; feedforward neural networks; machine learning; optimisation of infrastructure; range anxiety; smart transport systems; sustainable urban planning","algorithm; demand-side management; electric vehicle; energy storage; machine learning; smart grid; sustainability; urban planning; Dublin [(CTY) Leinster]","This research was funded by Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number 18/CRT/6222.

Electric vehicles, utilized as distributed energy storage, emerge as a potential solution. However, it remains unclear whether electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs), acting as demand dispatch resources, have a favorable impact on the overall electricity market, especially when considering their performance in real-time markets during day-ahead energy allocations. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized clearing mechanism (DCM) relying on an multi-attribute evaluation model of EVAs for optimal bidding strategies in the day-ahead market. The EVAs multi-attribute evaluation model employs an integration of the Entropy-Analytic Hierarchy Process, allowing for the simultaneous consideration of real-time performance and day-ahead bidding prices of EVAs. Consequently, the decentralized clearing mechanism supports strategic electricity planning in the day-ahead market by incorporating the actual market performance of EVAs. Furthermore, a real-time market bidding model is developed to balance dynamic mismatches between VRE generation and demand, aiming to maximize profits through optimized real-time commitment and real-time dispatch. System simulations on the IEEE39 bus system demonstrate that the DCM enhances overall profits by 18.69% compared to the centralized clearing mechanism. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity market; EVAs performance; Variable renewable energy sources; Vehicle to grid","Day ahead market; Decentralised; Electric vehicle aggregator performance; Market performance; Performance; Real-time market; Renewable energy source; Variable renewable energies; Variable renewable energy source; Vehicle to grids; Clean energy; alternative energy; analytical hierarchy process; demand-side management; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy storage; smart grid","The authors thank the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 72374163 , 72293601 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WUT: 2023IV001h ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202354326"

The model is applied in three different geographic cases and for four future time-points, starting off with the already existing transmission and generation capacities, so as to yield insights into different systems and different stages along the energy transition. The results show that frequency control constraints in the optimization model have a weak impact on the system composition and cost, and that batteries are important for minimizing the impact. Furthermore, inertia requirements without a reserve demand show no impact on the cost or system composition.

This manuscript introduces a novel planning model for the allocation ofWCSs based on DGs with an aggressor-based approach. A Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP) is formulated to optimize the allocation process. Probabilistic models are developed to accurately represent the stochastic behaviour of WCSs, residential loads, and DGs. The proposed model considers the cost and revenue components of both WCSs and solar-based DGs. Furthermore, a distinct distribution network is depicted on a geographical map to illustrate the connectivity of the network within the urban area while considering practical constraints for the installation of WCSs and solar-based DGs at each bus location. A new scoring scheme incorporating geographical aspects is presented to estimate the demand for WCS locations for EV riders. This scoring scheme aims to maximize revenue for investors by ensuring the installation of solar-based WCSs.

Given that electric vehicle fast charging stations (EVFCS) can burden the electricity grid, it is crucial for EVFCS to adopt sustainable energy supply methods while accommodating the growing demands of EVs. Despite recent research efforts to optimize the placement of renewable-powered EV charging stations, current planning methods face challenges when applied to a complex city scale and integrating with renewable energy resources. This study thus introduces a robust decision-making model for optimal EVFCS placement planning integrated with solar power supply in a large and complex urban environment (e.g., Chicago), utilizing an advantage actor-critic (A2C) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The model balances traffic demand with energy supply, strategically placing charging stations in areas with high traffic density and solar potential. As a result, the model is used to optimally place 1,000 charging stations with a random starting search approach, achieving total reward values of 74.30 %, and estimated the capacities of potential EVFCS. This study can inform the identification of suitable locations to advance the microgrid-based charging infrastructure systems in large urban environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Advantage actor-critic; Deep reinforcement learning; Electric vehicle fast charging station; Geospatial analysis; Infrastructure planning","Charging (batteries); Decision making; Deep learning; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Learning systems; Solar energy; Urban planning; Actor critic; Advantage actor-critic; Charging station; City scale; Deep reinforcement learning; Electric vehicle fast charging station; Fast charging stations; Geo-spatial analysis; Infrastructure planning; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning; decision making; electric vehicle; electricity supply; infrastructure planning; location decision; machine learning; solar power; spatial analysis; transportation infrastructure; travel demand; urban transport","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199949528"

Two issues should be addressed particularly for the optimal sizing of SLBs. Compared with fresh batteries, the failure rate of SLBs is relatively high, and timely and preventive replacement is needed. In addition, the flexibility introduced by EVs and installed SLBs should be coordinated to achieve optimal economic benefits. This paper focuses on the efficient utilization of SLBs by highlighting reliability-flexibility concerns in optimal sizing. The model is formulated as a bi-level model. On the upper-level, considering the operational reliability constraints of SLBs, decisions regarding the investment and replacement of SLBs are optimized. Distribution network operations are improved on the lowerlevel, with an effective spatiotemporal flexible dispatch strategy for EVs. Finally, a linearized process for the optimal sizing of SLBs is presented and efficiently implemented. The Sioux Falls network and IEEE 69-node distribution network are coupled as the test system. According to the simulation results, when the state of health of the SLBs decreased to 70%, the conditions were unreliable. The differences in the optimal SLB size and costs considering reliability and flexibility are highlighted. © 2024 The Author(s).

It seems that with the expansion of renewable energy sources (RESs) as clean energy and investigation of the effects of EVs on the operation and planning of future distribution networks around the way EVs exchange energy with each other and the upstream network operator, RESs such as solar and wind sources, along with hydrogen storage are essential. Therefore, a new stochastic multi-scenario approach for charge/discharge management of EVs parked in IPL was proposed, in which a newly developed model for the IPL with a hydrogen storage system (HSS) consisting of a fuel cell, an electrolyzer, and a hydrogen storage tank was presented. In the proposed model, the constraints of upstream network and power balance constraints, with the operating constraints related to the IPL, including EVs, renewable energy sources, and the hydrogen storage system, were formulated as the most important objectives of the optimization problem. The optimization algorithm, Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO), was formulated for implementation, and its results were compared with those of the PSO and GWO algorithms. The CSO must handle a variety of practical, large-scale optimization problems. Based on the obtained results, the excess energy purchased from the upstream network or renewable sources was used as hydrogen storage for consumption during peak hours. As expected, the technical constraints and financial goals of the system were met, and the proposed system was evaluated on a 33-bus network. As the expected benefits will be the most beneficial with the presence of renewable sources, the final profit will be reduced by taking into account uncertainty for charge/discharge management in EVs such as the uncertainty of electric load, market price, wind turbine, and photovoltaic cell sources. Nonetheless, the profit obtained from renewable resources is preferable to losses resulting from the uncertainty of the system, and according to expectation, the performance of the system for managing the optimal charging and discharging of EVs in the IPL will be acceptable with the maximum profit for the grid. © 2024 The Author(s).

To this end, this paper proposes an optimal EV charging schedule in order to allocate the charging of EVs in non-overlapping time slots, aiming to avoid overloading conditions that could stress the DN operation. The problem is structured as a linear optimization problem in GAMS, and the linear Distflow is utilized for the power flow analysis required. The proposed approach is compared to the one where EV charging is not optimally scheduled and each EV is expected to start charging upon its arrival at the residential charging spot. Moreover, the analysis is extended to examine the optimal siting of small-sized residential Photovoltaic (PV) systems in order to provide further relief to the DN. A mixed-integer quadratic optimization model was formed to integrate the PV siting into the optimization problem as an additional optimization variable and is compared to a heuristic-based approach for determining the sites for PV installation. The proposed methodology has been applied in a typical low-voltage (LV) DN as a case study, including real power demand data for the residences and technical characteristics for the EVs. The results indicate that both the DN power losses and the voltage profile are further improved in regard to the heuristic-based approach, and the simultaneously scheduled penetration of EVs and PVs could yield up to a 66.3% power loss reduction. © 2024 by the authors.","distribution network; electrical vehicle; mixed-integer quadratic program; penetration; photovoltaic siting; power quality","Charging stations; DC distribution systems; Heuristic methods; Integer linear programming; Photovoltaics; Power distribution networks; State of charge; Electrical vehicles; Loss reduction; Mixed integer quadratic program; Penetration; Photovoltaic siting; Power; Powerloss; Prosumer; Vehicle charging; Mixed-integer linear programming","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207423431"

Wireless charging EVs offer promising solutions to wired charging limitations such as restricted travel range and lengthy charging times. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to address the challenges of wireless power transfer (WPT) for EVs by optimizing coupling frequency and coil design to enhance efficiency while minimizing electromagnetic interference (EMI) and heat generation. A novel coil design and adaptive hardware are proposed to improve power transfer efficiency (PTE) by defining the optimal magnetic resonant coupling WPT and mitigating coil misalignment, which is considered a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of WPT for EVs. A new methodology for designing and arranging roadside lanes and facilities for dynamic wireless charging (DWC) of EVs is introduced. This includes the optimization of transmitter coils (TCs), receiving coils (RCs), compensation circuits, and high-frequency inverters/converters using the partial differential equation toolbox (pdetool). The integration of wireless charging systems with smart grid technology is explored to enhance energy distribution and reduce peak load issues. The paper proposes a DWC system with multiple segmented transmitters integrated with adaptive renewable photovoltaic (PV) units and a battery system using the utility main grid as a backup. The design process includes the determination of the required PV array capacity, station battery sizing, and inverters/converters to ensure maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To validate the proposed system, it was tested in two scenarios: charging a single EV at different speeds and simultaneously charging two EVs over a 1 km stretch with a 50 kW system, achieving a total range of 500 km. Experimental validation was performed through real-time simulation and hardware tests using an OPAL-RT platform, demonstrating a power transfer efficiency of 90.7%, thus confirming the scalability and feasibility of the system for future EV infrastructure. © 2024 by the authors.","dynamic wireless charging; electrical vehicles; renewable energy","Charging stations; Charging time; Computer graphics equipment; Inductive power transmission; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Nuclear batteries; Orbital laboratories; Sailing vessels; Satellites; Solar power generation; State of charge; Vehicle-to-grid; Coil designs; Dynamic wireless charging; Electrical vehicles; Photovoltaics; Power transfer efficiency; Power transfers; Renewable energies; Wireless charging; Wireless charging system; Wireless power","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207384433"

These integrated energy systems incorporate wind and solar power, natural gas supply, and interactions with electric vehicles and the main power grid. In the optimization planning method developed, the objectives of cost-effective and low-carbon operation, the lifecycle cost of hybrid energy storage, power quality improvements, and renewable energy utilization are targeted and coordinated by using utility fusion theory. Our planning method addresses multiple energy forms—cooling, heating, electricity, natural gas, and renewable energies—which are integrated through a combined cooling, heating, and power system and a natural gas turbine. The hybrid energy storage system incorporates batteries and compressed-air energy storage systems to handle fast and slow variations in power demand, respectively. A sensitivity matrix between the output power of the energy sources and the voltage is modeled by using the power flow method in DistFlow, reflecting the improvements in power quality and the respective constraints. The method proposed is validated by simulating various typical scenarios on the modified IEEE 13-node distribution network topology.

Otherwise, significant power variations on the tie-line connecting the MG to the main power grid could occur. This study introduces an innovative scheduling strategy that utilizes a data-driven approach, employing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve this smoothing effect. The strategy prioritizes the scheduling of MG's internal power devices, taking into account the stochastic charging patterns of electric vehicles. The scheduling optimization model is initially described as a Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing power fluctuations on the interconnection lines and operational costs of the MG. Subsequently, after preprocessing the historical operational data of the MG, an enhanced scheduling strategy is developed through a neural network learning process. Finally, the results from four scheduling scenarios demonstrate the significant impact of the proposed strategy. Comparisons of reward curves before and after data preprocessing underscore its importance. In contrast to optimization results from deep deterministic policy gradient, soft actor-critic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms, the superiority of the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with the addition of a priority experience replay mechanism is highlighted. © 2024 The Author(s).

Herein, the uncertain EVPLs are integrated into the SCUC problem with the aim of reducing the operation cost. It is notable that growing integration of unspecified EVPLs can introduce novel challenges to the power system, significantly impacting its flexibility. In this study, electric vehicles are leveraged as a means to enhance system flexibility. Meanwhile, the FDI attacks in EVPLs can distort the system's flexibility and lead to inaccurate assessments of the power system's ability to adapt to changing conditions. In order to model the FDI attack, a bi-level optimization problem based on mixed integer linear programming is formulated. At the upper level, the impact of EVPLs on the flexibility indices of the SCUC is evaluated, and the false data injected into the EVPL is calculated at the lower level. Since both levels of the proposed FBSCUC<inf>FDI</inf>P-P/EV include discrete variables, a reformulation and decomposition technique is utilized to achieve the optimal solution.

The simulation results initially indicate the improvement of the flexibility of the power system in proposed structure. Further, injecting false data into all available EVPLs causes to increase the system operation cost.

However, due to their uncertain nature, RES can cause imbalances in power demand. Recently, Power-to-X (P2X) station technology has gained attention as a solution to the uncertainties of RES and as a means to enhance the capacity and efficiency of RES operations. P2X stations can be utilized when power demand imbalances occur due to the uncertain output of RES or when the power system cannot accommodate the power supply from RES due to various stability issues. Specifically, when supply disruptions occur in the power system due to RES uncertainties, P2X stations contribute to preventing RES curtailment by supplying power to electric vehicle (EV) fuel sources, producing heat using electric heat pumps (EHP), or producing hydrogen using electrolyzers (ELZ), thus improving the uncertain financial benefits for independent power producers (IPP). This paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based chance-constrained two-stage stochastic optimization (CCTS) approach to address imbalances in power demand from RES and to enhance the profitability of IPP by finding the optimal planning and operational solutions for P2X stations. The proposed method provides hierarchical level results, demonstrating that economic benefits can increase by up to 60.2% with the application of P2X stations and that curtailed energy from RES can be reduced by up to 76.5%. The proposed methodology is also validated for its superior performance by being compared with both the non-linear stochastic chance constraint method and the stochastic method. © 2024 The Author(s)","Ambiguity set; Distributionally robust optimization; Mixed-integer linear programming; Power to gas; Wind farm","Carbon; Constrained optimization; Hydrogen production; Integer programming; Stochastic programming; Wind power; Ambiguity set; Distributionally robust optimization; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear; Mixed-integer linear programming; Power; Power to gas; Renewable energy source; Robust optimization; Wind farm; Stochastic systems","This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy(MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20225500000110).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201008040"

This work proposes a two-stage strategy for the optimal planning of EV charging stations (EVCS) and DGs in a coupled TN-DN. In the first stage, a fuzzy max–min framework embedded particle swarm optimization and an EV waiting time constraint-encapsulated M/M/S queuing theory are used to obtain the optimal locations and sizes of EVCS. The objectives considered in this stage are maximizing EVCS operator profit and minimizing the costs of EV users and DN operator (DNO). In the second stage, a distribution system integrated with EVCS is used to find suitable sites and capacities for renewable DGs. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to identify the ideal locations of renewable DGs, and an exhaustive search-based analytical method is used to determine their sizes. Moreover, in this stage, a cost–benefit analysis is performed to assess the economic viability of planning renewable DGs. To address the uncertainties associated with EVs and renewable sources, Hong's 2m+1 point estimation method is used. The efficacy of the suggested approach is tested on a coupled 28-node TN and a 69-node grid-connected DN. The findings reveal that the EVCS and DN operators will achieve an average incremental profit of 21.80% and 42.03%, respectively, while meeting all the system constraints. Further, the DNO gains an additional revenue of 20.17% by adopting distribution network reconfiguration. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle charging station; Fuzzy max–min; Hong's 2m＋1 point estimate method; Network reconfiguration; Renewable distributed generation","Charging (batteries); Distributed power generation; Electric vehicles; Location; Particle size analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Queueing theory; Sensitivity analysis; Charging station; Distributed generators; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Fuzzy max–min; Hong 2m＋1 point estimate method; Max/min; Networks reconfiguration; Point-estimate methods; Renewable distributed generations; Cost benefit analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199722076"

The energy scenario is modelled up to the year 2050. It includes the replacement of all conventional passenger vehicles with electric vehicles. The vehicle-to-grid model was developed using the Calliope modelling tool. All fossil fuels used in the heating sector are replaced by seawater heat pump systems. Additional storage is added to the system and the system is connected to the adjacent electricity market. The 10-min model led to a reduction in cross-border transmission capacity of around 60 % and a 7-fold reduction in the difference between import and export compared to the hourly model. This led to a more stable system operation, as the import and export capacities were equalised.

Furthermore, electrification of the transportation system is an alternative promoted by many governments to mitigate the dependency on fossil fuels and achieve the goals of decarbonizing the economy. However, interconnecting a large quantity of distributed energy resources (DERs) to the power system reveals technical problems affecting the entire system. Planning coordinators and grid operators need to understand the full-spectrum impact of DERs on the power system to ensure secure and reliable grid planning and operations. The operation of a Hydro-Québec transmission system planned for 2030 is simulated in quasi-static time series mode with a massive integration of 1 million of electric vehicles and 1000 – 3000 MW of distributed photovoltaics.

It contributes to increased power loss and poses a threat to the security constraints of the electrical grid. Simultaneously, the global energy transition has led to a continuous increase in the proportion of renewable energy integrated into the grid. Electric vehicles (EVs), serving as representative of renewable energy, further magnify this load imbalance with their charging requirements, which poses a significant challenge to the stable operation of the grid. Therefore, to ensure the smooth operation of the grid under the context of renewable energy integration, the authors investigate the coordinated strategies of EV charging scheduling and route planning. The authors first model the coupling of the transportation network with the smart grid as a cyber-physical system. Subsequently, the authors simulate and analyse the daily charging load curve of the network, capturing the travel characteristics of EVs. Based on this, the authors research the EV charging scheduling in both individual and collective travel scenarios during peak and off-peak hours. For the off-peak travel period of EVs, a charging schedule strategy based on travel plans is proposed, which reduces the time cost of EV owners' travel. Furthermore, for the collective travel of a large number of EVs within the system, a multi-EV charging scheduling strategy based on charging station load balancing is presented. This strategy effectively balances the load levels of various charging stations while reducing the overall system travel time. Ultimately, through experimental results, the authors demonstrate that by deploying appropriate charging scheduling strategies, EVs cease to be a burden on the grid and can be transformed into tools for balancing the loads across different regions. © 2024 The Authors.

However, there is limited understanding of how these systems perform over a range of building stock conditions that will evolve with future efficiency and electrification trends, posing challenges for identifying optimal electric resiliency investments. This study quantifies how residential energy consumption impacts the capability of PVESS to provide home backup power during long-duration power interruptions. We model statistically representative distributions of the residential building stock and estimate storage sizes required to provide backup power as a series of building envelope efficiency, load flexibility, and electrification measures are applied. For the baseline building stock, median storage size requirements range from 10 kWh in temperate weather conditions to 90 kWh in hot climates for a 3-day power interruption. Applying energy efficiency and temperature set-point adjustments reduce storage size requirements by 2–45 kWh (16%–53 %). In hot locations, heat pump retrofits reduce median storage sizing by an additional 10–30 kWh while in cold locations, they drive 10–50 kWh of storage capacity increase. Our results suggest that bi-directional EV charging may be essential to enabling PVESS backup of heating and cooling, given their typically large kWh sizes. © 2024 The Author(s)","Backup power; Electric resilience; Electrification; Energy efficiency; Load flexibility; Solar; Storage","Electric loads; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Housing; Investments; Solar power generation; Standby power systems; Back-up power; Building stocks; Condition; Electric resilience; Electrification; Load flexibility; Photovoltaics; Power interruptions; Solar; Storage systems; Energy efficiency; building; cooling; electrification; energy efficiency; energy storage; heating; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; residential energy; solar power; technology adoption; United States","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 (Award Number 38425).

Considering uncertainties, which are associated with solar irradiance and wind speed, can increase the ability to achieve proper energy management. In addition to that, considering the smart grid's role in the electricity market as a price maker and the unpredictable behavior of EVs, these considerations aim to minimize costs and maximize profits for microgrids. The main contribution of this paper is studying the impact of increasing the charging tariff of EVs in the presence of different types of RERs on charging behavior, maximizing the profit of the microgrid, and reducing the total energy purchased from the wholesale market. For this purpose, a metaheuristic-based optimization problem called Gorilla Troops optimizer (GTO) is employed to optimally allocate the RERs and the EV charging stations. The results demonstrate that increasing the charging tariff without RERs or with only one source of RERs results in the charging of EVs following an uncontrollable strategy. Hence, the cost of purchasing energy from the utility increases. On the other hand, compared to the base case, integrating EV charging stations with multi- type RERs resulted in the profit increasing by 61.92 % and the total energy purchased from the wholesale market decreasing by 24.98 %. Moreover, the waiting time at the charging station will be reduced shortly; the annual installment of multi- type RERs decreased by 31.25 % compared with considering only one source of RERs, and the charging strategy of EVs followed the controllable charging strategy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Charging station; Electric vehicles; Microgrids; Optimization; Renewable energy resources","Charging (batteries); Commerce; Energy management; Microgrids; Optimization; Profitability; Renewable energy; Sales; Smart power grids; Wind; Charging station; Charging strategies; Electric vehicle charging; Microgrid; Optimal planning; Optimisations; Optimizers; Photovoltaics; Total energy; Wholesale markets; Electric vehicles","This work was supported by the grants for the Requalification of the Spanish University System for 2021-2023, Next Generation EU.

On-site power generation through renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the viable approaches to meet the demands of EVs and other loads of a campus. Hence, an optimal sizing of a hybrid PV–Wind system is considered in this work to build a Net Zero Energy Campus (NZEC). Generally, EVs are scheduled after obtaining the size of RES through a sizing procedure. As a unique approach of this work, a smart EV charging framework is developed to model the profile of EV charging demand and this modeled load profile of EV is considered along with the local load profile of the campus for optimal sizing procedure. The size of PV–Wind sources are optimized by minimizing three objective functions such as the annual operating cost of the system (AOC), loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and total energy transfer (TET).

The volatility of renewable energy units and the uncertainty of EVs have produced non-negligible impacts on the operating stability of power systems. To achieve low-carbon and long-term stable in power systems, it is necessary to conduct effective planning for the synergistic development of renewable energy units and EVs. To investigates the interactive mechanism when concerning vehicle to grid (V2G) and energy storage charging pile in the system, a collaborative optimization model considering the complementarity of vehicle-storage charging pile is proposed. Four scenarios with different V2G proportions are compared with each other to verify the effectiveness of the model. Results show that during the planning period, the installation number of energy storage charging piles will significantly increase when V2G proportions expands. The total costs consistently show a descending trend if EVs participating more in V2G. When the V2G proportions increase from 25 % to 100 %, the total CO<inf>2</inf> emissions decrease by 4.49 %. In addition, the improvement of V2G proportions plays a vital role in peaking regulation. Overall, this study provides an innovative planning model to reduce the impact of wind power generation and uncontrolled charging of electric vehicles on grid stability, and opens up a practical solution path to balance the development conflicts between supply and demand. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions mitigation; Dispatching optimization; Energy storage; Integrated distribution network; V2G","Carbon; Charging (batteries); Economics; Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Piles; Power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Carbon emission mitigation; Carbon emissions; Dispatching optimization; Emissions mitigation; Energy units; Integrated distribution network; Optimisations; Renewable energies; Supply/demand balance; Vehicle to grids; Energy storage","Funding text 1: The authors thank the editor and the anonymous reviewer for their helpful comments and suggestions.

To balance battery degradation with fuel economy using gradient information, this study proposes a gradient-aware trade-off control strategy. Initially, a vehicle dynamics model and a battery degradation model are established. Based on the characteristics of known road information and remaining driving distance, state of charge planning of the battery is conducted. Subsequently, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II is applied for bi-objective optimization, yielding a set of Pareto solutions that represent different levels of energy consumption and battery degradation. Thereafter, by introducing a real-time battery degradation severity factor, an optimized bias coefficient is obtained, which adjusts in accordance with the gradient changes. Through the optimization of the bias line, the optimal bias solution set under different working conditions is determined, achieving the optimal control for power system. The fuel economy of the proposed strategy is improved by 6.8% relative to the mileage adaptive Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy, and the battery degradation inhibition is improved by 9.3%.

This underscores the need for adaptable tools to support strategic investments, grid reinforcement, and infrastructure deployment. In this context, the present study employs real-world datasets to propose a comprehensive spatial–temporal energy model that integrates a traffic model and geo-referenced data to realistically evaluate the flexibility potential embedded in the light-duty transportation sector for a given study region. The methodology involves assessing traffic patterns, evaluating the grid impact of EV charging processes, and extending the analysis to flexibility services, particularly in providing primary and tertiary reserves. The analysis is geographically confined to the Lombardy region in Italy, relying on a national survey of 8.2 million trips on a typical day. Given a target EV penetration equal to 2.5%, corresponding to approximately 200,000 EVs in the region, flexibility bands for both services are calculated and economically evaluated. Within the modeled framework, power-intensive services demonstrated significant economic value, constituting over 80% of the entire potential revenues. Considering European markets, the average marginal benefit for each EV owner is in the order of 10 € per year, but revenues could be higher for sub-classes of users better fitting the network needs. © 2024 by the authors.","electric vehicles; flexibility; geospatial planning; open-source data; smart charging","Ancillary service; Electric vehicle integrations; Flexibility; Geo-spatial; Geospatial planning; Mobility pattern; Open-source; Open-source data; Smart charging; Source data; Vehicle-to-grid","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205081605"

The performance and efficiency of both Distributed Generation (DG) and Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure are significantly affected by global temperature variation characteristics, which are taken into consideration in this study as it investigates the effects of these integrations. This scenario is further complicated by the unbalanced structure of distribution networks, which introduces inequalities that can enhance complexity and adverse effects. This paper analyzes the manner in which temperature changes influence the network operational voltage profile, power quality, energy losses, greenhouse harmful emissions, cost factor, and active and reactive power losses using analytical and heuristic techniques in the IEEE 69 bus network in both three-phase balance and modified unbalanced load conditions. In order to maximize adaptability and efficiency while minimizing the adverse impacts on the unbalanced distribution system, the findings demonstrate significant variables to take into account while locating the optimal location and size of DG and EV charging stations. To figure out the objective, three-phase distribution load flow is utilized by the particle swarm optimization technique. Greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 61.4%, 64.5%, and 60.98% in each of the three temperature case circumstances, while in the modified unbalanced condition, they dropped by 57.55%, 60.39%, and 62.79%.

The outcomes provide valuable facts that electricity companies, decision-makers, along with other energy sector stakeholders may utilize to formulate strategies that adapt to the fluctuating patterns of electricity distribution during fluctuations in global temperature under balanced and unbalanced conditions of network. © 2024 by the authors.","active and reactive power loss; balanced and unbalanced distribution system; electrical vehicles charging corridors; greenhouse gas emissions; integrated renewable distributed generation; particle swarm optimization; voltage profile","Greenhouse gas emissions; Low emission; Power distribution networks; Reactive power; Active and reactive power loss; Balanced and unbalanced distribution system; Electrical vehicle charging corridor; Electrical vehicles; Integrated renewable distributed generation; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Renewable distributed generations; Swarm optimization; Unbalanced distribution systems; Vehicle charging; Voltage profile; DC distribution systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204934637"

However, an improper energy management leads to not only energy waste but also undesired costs and emissions. Accordingly, the authors develop a two-layer shipboard energy management framework. In the initial stage, a shipboard navigation planning problem is formulated that considers battery state estimation and is subsequently solved using particle swarm optimisation to obtain an optimal speed trajectory. To track the scheduled speed, a reinforcement learning method based on a deep Q-Network is proposed in the second stage to realise real-time energy management of the diesel generator and energy storage system.

To address the challenges that arise from intermittent renewable generation, we explore the introduction of community batteries to provide an elegant solution for storing excess generation of renewable energy resources (RESs) and reverting to the grid in peak demand periods. In particular, determining the optimal battery type and size along with the minimum costs is challenging. Moreover, the growth in adapting electrical vehicles (EVs) imposes additional demand-related challenges on the power system, compared to the traditional industrial and household demands. This paper introduces a long-term planning strategy for community batteries to capture the surplus generation of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panels in a given area, and direct the stored energy to charge EVs, without injecting to the upstream grid. For long-term investment planning on batteries, we consider 15 years’ worth of historical data associated with solar irradiance, temperature, EV demands, and household demands. A novel stochastic mathematical model is proposed for decision-making on battery specifications (the type and capacity of the batteries needed per year) based on the four standard battery types (based on capacity) provided by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. Uncertainties related to the EVs and RESs are captured by a non-parametric robust technique, namely the information gap decision theory, from optimistic and pessimistic perspectives. The investment decision determining component is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, incorporating the GUROBI optimisation tool, that provides a feasible global solution with a low computational burden. Our proposed solution not only determines the optimal battery installation strategies to improve the stability profile of the grid by capturing the excess power of PV generation but also facilitates EV integration in the community towards reaching the net-zero emissions target.

In this context, this study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI) approach utilizing the genetic algorithm optimization technique to identify optimal installation nodes for BESS, EV charging stations, and DG units within the grid. The framework aims to minimize energy losses in the distribution system, incorporating a peak load shaving strategy in the BESS. The mathematical model encompasses technical and operational constraints from the resources and the grid. To address the complexity ensuing from exploring an extensive solution space, handling constraints, and managing the decision variables, a real coded genetic algorithm is employed to determine the optimal locations. Through simulations on a distribution feeder, the study demonstrates that resources installed based on the proposed approach significantly benefit the grid. This is evidenced by a reduction in energy losses, improved voltage levels, and demand mitigation during peak periods. An analysis of the BESS impact on losses, with respect to its installation nodes, is also conducted.

In this context, this work proposes an efficient approach to enhance the reliability and security of radial distribution networks (RDNs) by assigning the optimal planning of uncertain multiple WTGs along with optimized PEVs charging simultaneously using a bi-level optimization strategy. The reliability indices considered are the load-oriented reliability indices, involving the energy not-supplied (ENS) and average energy no-supplied (AENS). Besides, the customer-oriented reliability indices include the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI), the system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI), and the average service unavailability index (ASUI). Moreover, the network security index (NSI) is considered, defining the risk degree of current-flow within power lines before reaching its extremes. The PEVs’ operational requirements are investigated, including their initial state of charges, arriving and departing times, as well as various controlled and uncontrolled charging patterns. The impacts of the protective devices installation, the linear failure rate of feeders, and the annual load growth on reliability and security are also addressed. The IEEE 33-bus distribution test network, with consideration of their annual datasets, is utilized to confirm the supremacy of the suggested approach. The findings show that the optimal planning of multiple WTGs along with optimized PEVs charging simultaneously successfully enhanced the values of load-oriented reliability indices, customer-oriented reliability indices, and the security index with a percentage reduction above 11%, 6%, and 33%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-level optimization; Electric vehicles; Reliability indices; Security index; Uncertainty modeling; Wind turbine generators","Electric loads; Failure analysis; Network security; Stochastic systems; Turbogenerators; Uncertainty analysis; Wind Turbine Generators; Bi-level optimization; Customers oriented; Operational challenges; Optimal planning; Plug-in electric vehicle charging; Reliability Index; Security indices; Stochastic nature; Uncertainty models; Wind turbine generators; Electric power distribution","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195477337"

However, uncertainties of swapping demand and regulation signals introduce risks to operational benefits and regulation performances. Aming to enhance overall profitability, this study proposes day-ahead bidding and real-time scheduling strategies for BSS to participate in frequency regulation. In the day-ahead stage, the BSS scheduling model is established. Then, the information-gap decision theory (IGDT) is employed to determine the optimal reserve capacities. The randomness of regulation signals is captured by designing a new uncertainty set based on statistical analysis. Additionally, a boundary autonomous selection (BAS) method is developed to solve the IGDT model, making the selected scenarios more consistent with real-world situations. In the intra-day stage, a real-time response strategy is proposed to track the regulation signals considering the BSS operation economy. Simulations are conducted using historical data from Pennsylvania, Jersey, and Maryland (PJM).

In addition, the literature review shows that a research gap exists regarding a clustering-based method to optimize the allocation of DGs and EVCSs, considering the system uncertainties. This article tries to fill such a knowledge gap by proposing a new clustering-based method to optimize the allocation of DGs and EVs simultaneously, considering the uncertainties of EV behaviours and stochastic behaviours of renewable DGs. Developing a new stochastic model for EVs using the clustering algorithm is one of the essential contributions. The uncertain parameters, e.g. EV charging loads based on EV owners’ behaviours (arrival time, departure time, and driving distance) and renewable DGs, would be clustered. The proposed method could solve the execution time challenges of Monte Carlo simulation-based approaches to concern the stochastic behaviours of smart grids. The simultaneously reliability-oriented optimal allocation of EVCSs, DGs, and protection equipment, using the proposed clustering-based algorithm is another main contribution. The IEEE 33-bus test system is studied to examine the introduced method. Simulation results imply that a 1.45% accuracy improvement could be obtained compared to available analytical ones, while its execution time is appropriate. © 2024 The Author(s).

To maximize the economic benefits and station utilization under practical constraints set by regulatory authorities, utilities and DCFC station operators, this study explores and provides methods for connecting DCFC stations to the grid, employing low-power interconnection rules and distributed energy resources (DERs). The system uses automotive second-life batteries (SLBs) and photovoltaic (PV) systems as energy buffer and local energy resources to support EV charging and improve the station techno-economic feasibility through load shifting and charge sustaining. The optimal sizing of the DERs and the selection of the grid interconnection topology is achieved by means of a design space exploration (DSE) and exhaustive search approach to maximize the economic benefits of the charging station and to mitigate high-power demand to the grid. Without losing generality, this study considers a 150 kW DCFC station with a range of DER sizes, grid interconnection specifications and related electricity tariffs of American Electric Power (AEP) Ohio and the Public Utility Commission of Ohio (PUCO). Various realistic scenarios and strategies are defined to account for the interconnection requirements of the grid to the DCFC with DERs. The system’s techno-economic performance over a ten-year period for different scenarios is analyzed and compared using a multitude of metrics. The results of the analysis show that the the integration of DERs in DCFC stations has a positive impact on the economic value of the investment when compared to traditional installations. © 2024 by the authors.","DC fast charging; electric vehicles; microgrid; renewable resources; second-life automotive batteries","Automotive batteries; Electric power system interconnection; Electric prospecting; Fast charging (Batteries); Plutonium compounds; Renewable energy; State of charge; Vehicle-to-grid; Automotive battery; DC fast charging; Distributed Energy Resources; Fast charging stations; High power; Low Power; Microgrid; Renewable resource; Second Life; Second-life automotive battery; Charging stations","This research was funded by the Ford Alliance program.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202453077"

Building fuel-electric mixed fleets based on three-level network for location-routing planning is an emerging scheme to optimize the “last mile” of rural logistics. To compensate for the shortcomings of electric vehicles in terms of driving range and carrying capacity, distribution center infrastructure should be coordinately sited and constructed in the regional networks. With the goal of minimizing the carbon emissions and operating costs, we first study the country-township-village three-level logistics distribution network planning problem considering dynamic-static carbon emissions and fuel-electric mixed fleet configuration (DSCE-2E-LRPMFC). For solution this model, an innovative two-stage hybrid algorithm is developed which combines the improved OPTICS clustering algorithm considering temporal-spatial distance with the improved slime mould algorithm with multi-strategy (OTSD-MSSMA). Specifically, OTSD provides initial feasible location strategies and simplifies the logistics network by clustering the temporal-spatial distances of customers, reducing the complexity and difficulty for further optimization by MSSMA. The proposed MSSMA, integrating the pre-optimal mechanism for standard Brownian motion, post-optimal mechanism for improved Ant Colony Optimization, and real-time detection mechanism for iterative anomaly into the standard SMA, shows reliable performance in solving the proposed DSCE-2E-LRPMFC optimization. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and algorithm through a series of experimental studies.

The centralized operation of SAEVs not only allows large-scale travel demand response but also can provide essential ancillary services to the smart grid through the concept of vehicle-to-grid (V2G). With V2G technology, unused electric vehicles can work as a distributed energy storage facility for the electricity grid to smoothen the intermittent demand. Designing and operating a V2G-enabled SAEV system is challenging. This problem involves complicated planning and operational decisions, as well as time-varying electric tariffs. In this work, a flow-based Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model is formulated for determining the optimal configurations (charging infrastructure and fleet size) and daily operation strategies (serving passengers, relocation, charging/discharging). The developed mathematical model allows for maximizing the total profit, comprising investment cost, revenue from serving passengers, and V2G profit through charging/discharging schedules.

Also, it determines how to well-operate the expanded network. HV substation allocation, feeder routing, and conductor sizing besides executing such flexibility-oriented upgrades as designing of distribution network (DN) as a meshed topology by allocating switching devices to form reconfigurable DN, utilizing distributed generations (DGs) and parking-lots are the options are considered in this paper. It must be mentioned that, the peak load rarely happens in a year, but it’s commonly considered as the base of traditional DEP, which leads to a situation which balancing the load and generation would be difficult and so costly. So, in the proposed methodology, by enabling the optimal schedule of the transferable loads, smoothing of the load profile and finally better managing the uncertainties and variability of supply and demand across all relevant timescales is reached. As known, in the expansion planning process, the accepted level of risk by distribution companies is an important factor when decision-making. To model this issue, information gap decision theory (IGDT) is used in the present work.

In this context, the most significant challenge encountered today is the need for a more immediate renewal of distribution grid expansion plans, owing to the rapid increase in energy demand and the grid integration of renewable energy power plants and electric vehicle charging stations. In order to find a solution to this issue, an active distribution network has been analyzed under five scenarios based on load demand forecasting. The artificial neural network method has been employed for the forecast of load demand, and the DigSilent Power Factory (DPF) model of the distribution network has been utilized to analyze the effects of scenarios. Connecting PV plants with capacities of 3 MW and 5 MW to different feeders in the distribution network, along with Hydrogen Energy Storage (HES) with a capacity of 1 MW to one feeder, has resulted in a reduction of the distribution transformer's occupancy rate from 79.8% to 70.6%. The contribution of a 1 MW HES system to the transformer occupancy rate was determined to be 1.3%. The results highlight the importance of considering the annual load demand forecast, as well as the network integration of PV power plants, electric vehicle charging stations, and hydrogen storage in grid expansion planning. © 2024","Distribution substation; Expansion planning; Hydrogen storage","Electric energy storage; Electric power factor; Electric power system planning; Electric substations; Electric transformers; Forecasting; Investments; Neural networks; Outages; Charging station; Distribution substations; Electric vehicle charging; Electrical energy distribution; Electricity networks; Expansion planning; Grid expansions; Hydrogen energy storages; Load demand; Occupancy rate; Electric loads","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186069150"

One of the aims of this research is to assess the potential impact of uncontrolled EV charging on community-scale distribution networks, exploring how this could stress the existing electrical infrastructure. It also explores the role of EVs in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and smart charging applications, aiming to enhance community distribution systems. The study investigates the maximum stabilisation level achievable under various scenarios, highlighting the importance of smart energy management in integrating renewable energy and addressing uncertainties in the modelling process. Additionally, this study discusses the proposed systems' scalability, consumer behaviours' impact on the suggested energy solutions, and the potential implications of recent technological advancements for simulated communities. The research employs a sophisticated, integrative approach, combining stochastic methods with several robust energy software. Key findings suggest that uncontrolled EV charging can lead to grid capacity issues at high EV penetration levels, particularly during colder months. While smart charging and V2G technologies can moderate peak loads in many scenarios, achieving 100 % sustainable technology integration requires enhanced energy management or increased network capacity, especially in winter. Wind and solar power integration demonstrates strategic complementarity, particularly in winter, enhancing the reliability and stability of the community grid. It is also observed that peak solar generation hours misalign with the community's highest demand times, posing challenges for solar energy utilisation in EV charging in residential-based areas. © 2024 The Authors","Electric vehicles (EVS); Renewable energy integration; Smart charging solutions; Sustainable urban living; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology","Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy utilization; Housing; Integration; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging solutions; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging; Heat pumps; Renewable energy integrations; Smart charging; Smart charging solution; Sustainable urban living; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology; Solar energy; electric vehicle; holistic approach; residential location; sustainability; technology adoption; transportation development; transportation planning; urban transport","The research assumptions can be supported by the practical implementations observed in European demonstrator projects across Denmark, the Netherlands, and Poland, as highlighted in the SERENE H2020 project ( SERENE 2024 ).

At the same time, in the coming years the energy landscape will change into a system in which an increase in decentralized systems based on renewable energy sources will take over the leading function. This transformation process will further increase the complexity and overall pressure for change in energy systems over the next decade. In order to be able to ensure the energy supply and the reliable system operation of the grids in the future as well, communicative networking of generators, storage systems, electrical consumers and grid equipment is indispensable.

This strategy, which is currently widely suggested in policies on the energy transition, would impact consumer behavior. Despite the importance of studying the latter, the focus here is on decisions regarding the type, location, and timeframe of implementing the related measures. As such, solutions must be assessed in terms of cost and feasibility, technological learning, and by considering geographical and environmental constraints. Based on techno-economic optimization, in this paper we analyze the evolution of the power system and elaborate plausible long-term trajectories in the energy systems of two European islands. The case studies, Procida in Italy and Hinnøya in Norway, are both electrically connected to the mainland by submarine cables and present issues in their power systems, which are here understood as relatively isolated power systems. Renewable energy integration is encouraged by legislative measures in Italy. Although not modeled here, they serve as a backbone for the assumptions of increasing these investments. For Procida, rooftop photovoltaics (PV) coupled with energy storage are integrated in the residential, public, and tertiary sectors. A price-based strategy is also applied reflecting the Italian electricity tariff structure. At a certain price difference between peak and off-peak, the electricity supply mix changes, favoring storage technologies and hence decreasing imports by up to 10% during peak times in the year 2050. In Norway, renewable energy resources are abundant. The analysis for Hinnøya showcases possible cross-sectoral flexibilities through electrification, leading to decarbonization. By fine-tuning electric vehicle charging tactics and leveraging Norway’s electricity pricing model, excess electricity demand peaks can be averted. The conclusions of this double-prospective study provide a comparative analysis that presents the lessons learnt and makes replicability recommendations for other territories. © 2024 by the authors.","decarbonization; demand response; electric vehicles; energy planning; European islands; flexibility; optimization; power systems; renewable energy; rooftop PV; storage","Consumer behavior; Costs; Decarbonization; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; Investments; Decarbonisation; Demand response; Energy planning; European island; Flexibility; Optimisations; Photovoltaics; Power; Power system; Renewable energies; Rooftop photovoltaic; Renewable energy","This research was supported in the framework of the GIFT project (Geographical Islands FlexibiliTy), an innovative project, as part of the H2020 research program of the European Union, under grant agreement No. 824410.

The PFCEV's ESS comprises three core components: a battery, a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (FC) system, and a supercapacitor (SC). Performance evaluation involves strict constraints on the vehicle's operational parameters, and simulations are conducted following the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). A notable contribution of this research is the implementation of a double-loop optimization technique using quadratic programming (QP) and a genetic algorithm (GA) to identify a feasible solution space that respects the specified constraints. In summary, the findings yield valuable insights and recommendations for the optimal sizing of PFCEV ESS.

In consequence, the public attention has shifted upstream and holistically towards the integration of large-scale transportation electrification to power systems. This paper proposes a method to identify bottlenecks in power transmission systems to accommodate large-scale and stochastic electric vehicles charging demands. First, a distributionally robust chance-constrained direct current optimal power flow model is developed to quantify the impacts of stochastic electric vehicles charging demands. Subsequently, an agent-based model with the trip-chain method is applied to obtain the spatiotemporal distributions of electric vehicles charging demands for both light-duty electric vehicles and medium and heavy-duty electric vehicles. The first two moments of those distributions are extracted to build an ambiguity set of electric vehicles charging demands. Finally, a 121-bus synthetic transmission network for New York State power systems is used to validate the future transportation electrification in New York State from 2025 to 2035. Results show that the large-scale transportation electrification in New York State will account for approximately 13.33 % to 16.79 % of the total load demand by 2035. The transmission capacity is the major bottleneck in supporting New York State to achieve its transportation electrification. To resolve the bottlenecks, we explore some possible solutions, such as transmission capacity expansion and distributed energy resources investment. Wind power shows an advantage over solar energy in terms of total operational costs due to better peak alignment between wind power and electric vehicles charging demand. © 2024 The Author(s)","Bottleneck identification; Distributionally robust optimization; Electric vehicle charging; Power transmission systems; Transportation Electrification at Scale; Trip Chain Method","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191023194"

This factor has magnified the significance of balancing markets in renewable-based distribution networks, as these markets address uncertainties and are vital for operational stability. Consequently, this paper introduces a two-stage multi-layer methodology for organizing local energy and balancing markets among Residential Microgrids (RMGs) within an Active Distribution Network (ADN). The AND operator organizes both energy and balancing markets. In the first stage, the intra-day energy market operates, engaging non-profit-seeking aggregators, RMGs, and ADN. Moving to the second stage, the intra-hour balancing market is conducted involving profit-seeking Flexible Load (FL) and Electric Vehicle (EV) aggregators, RMGs, and ADN. The ADN operator organizes both markets and can alter the network topology online within the energy market. The planning of profit-seeking aggregators is formulated using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and Strong Duality Theory (SDT) in the form of Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), considering the correlation of aggregators' profit with the satisfaction index of end-users. The simulation results of the proposed methodology on a modified 118-bus IEEE distribution test system using GAMS indicate that this approach not only provides a significant share of balancing capacities through FLs and EVs but also ensures system stability against intra-hour fluctuations across various scenarios. The results also validate that the proposed methodology achieves a reduction of 24.8 % in power losses and 5.06 % in market costs, while simultaneously ensuring profitability for both aggregators and RMGs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Active distribution networks; Electric vehicle fleets; Electricity markets; Microgrids; Renewable energy sources; Smart prosumers","Electric loads; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Housing; Mathematical programming; Natural resources; Power markets; Profitability; Renewable energy; System stability; Vehicle-to-grid; Active distribution network; Active distributions; Balancing market; Electric vehicle fleet; Energy markets; Microgrid; Renewable energy source; Residential microgrid; Smart prosumer; Vehicle fleets; Electric power distribution; alternative energy; distribution system; electric vehicle; energy market; renewable resource; residential energy; smart city","The research is supported by the Quality Culture Professional Committee Foundation of China (No.ZGWH13650KT), and Yanbian University Doctoral Startup Foundation (No.602024012).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189935461"

This paper proposes a hybrid approach for EV smart charging with network expansion planning. The hybrid technique is the joint execution of the coati optimization algorithm (COA) and cascade-correlation-growing deep learning neural network, commonly known as the COA-CCG-DLNN technique. The objective of the proposed method is to minimize the cost of charging EVs, and it forecasts the best course of action. EV charging with network expansion is based on vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and grid-to-vehicle (G2V). The COA approach is used to minimize the cost of EV charging and the CCG-DLNN approach is used to predict the optimal solution for the system. The proposed method is executed on the MATLAB platform and is compared with existing techniques like particle swarm optimization (PSO), heap-based optimization (HBO), and wild horse optimization (WHO).

It introduces dynamic loads due to varying user behaviors, posing operational challenges for the power system. The integration of EVs into the grid through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology is becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution for day-ahead and real-time application, considering the interconnection between EVs and RESs. It presents methods utilizing V2G to minimize operational costs in power systems. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers 2024.","Economic dispatch; Electrical vehicle; Optimal power flow; Renewable energy source; Vehicle-to-Grid","Behavioral research; Dynamic loads; Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric power system economics; Electric power system planning; Natural resources; Renewable energy; Economic Dispatch; Electrical vehicles; Grid operation; Operation of power system; Optimal power flows; Power; Renewable energy source; Smart vehicles; User behaviors; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid","This paper was supported by Korea institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) grant funded by the Korea Government (MOTIE) (P0017305,Human Resource Development Program for Industrial Innovation) and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIP) (No. 2021R1A2B5B03086257).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184240815"

The investigations to feed the demand are developing with new approaches such as demand-side participation via storage systems and consumption management. Hence, demand-side management (DSM) has been spotlighted in smart grids for beneficial interrelationships between recommendation provisions and demand-side consumer energy behavior. This paper presents an energy management framework for smart homes with consideration of controllable appliances and electric vehicle operation. The three strategies such as 1) optimal appliance utilization, 2) optimal generation of the resources and 3) optimal discharge and charge of the electric vehicle are considered as proposed approaches in energy planning for day-ahead operation. The main objective functions are (1) minimizing energy generation costs, (2) minimizing emission pollution and (3) maximizing system flexibility. To prove the preference and validity of home energy management, two case studies are considered as assumptions to minimize costs and emissions and maximize the system's flexibility.

Electric vehicle (EV) charging through dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), known as roadway electrification, could shift EV demand profiles to better coincide with renewable electricity generation. However, this would be a very large new load and few studies evaluate the regional impacts of DWPT charging in a power transmission system. This paper defines methods that address dataset generation for passenger vehicle trips and models to evaluate regional impacts for this emerging technology. Household vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data form localized EV demand profiles through discrete-event simulation. This data serves as exogenous inputs for a Production Cost Model (PCM) of a synthetic transmission system based on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas's (ERCOT) network. EV charging methods are compared for both a 2018 baseline generation mixture and a high-renewable generation case incorporating 20 GW of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. The PCM employs unit commitment and economic dispatch (UC&ED) models to compare financial, environmental, and grid reliability impacts from EV charging across passenger EV adoption levels. In-transit charging could reduce grid operational costs by as much as 1.49%, with up to $13.7B saved in annual vehicle operational costs for consumers compared to gas-powered vehicles. Health impacts analysis from power plant and vehicle tailpipe emissions from this study show net health benefits increase by 40% for in-transit charging coupled with high renewable generation. Renewable resources provide an avenue for cost-effective in-transit charging with reduced emissions. The combination of dataset generation and open-source power system modeling establish a foundation for the holistic evaluation of regional DWPT impacts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic wireless power transfer; Electric vehicles; Photovoltaic generation; Power system simulation; Roadway electrification; Wireless electric vehicle charging","Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy transfer; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Inductive power transmission; Open systems; Solar power generation; Vehicle transmissions; Dynamic wireless power transfer; Electric vehicle charging; Passengers vehicles; Photovoltaics generations; Power systems simulation; Production cost model; Regional impacts; Roadway electrification; Wireless electric vehicle charging; Wireless electric vehicles; Electric vehicles; data set; electric vehicle; electrification; health impact; photovoltaic system; power generation; simulation; Texas; United States","The authors would like to thank Clayton Barrows and Sourabh Dalvi for their support on software development.

This paper proposes a bi-level planning model for EV charging stations that takes into account the characteristics of the spatial–temporal distribution of charging loads under an uncertain environment. First, the Origin–Destination (OD) matrix analysis method and the real-time Dijkstra dynamic path search algorithm are introduced and combined with the Larin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method to establish the EV charging load prediction model considering the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics. Second, the upper objective function with the objective of minimizing the cost of EV charging station planning and user charging behavior is constructed, while the lower objective function with the objective of minimizing the cost of distribution network operation and carbon emission cost considering the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaics is constructed. The constraints of the lower-layer objective function are transformed into the upper-layer objective function through Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, the optimal location and capacity of charging stations are finally determined, and the model of EV charging station siting and capacity determination is established.

As Electric Vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources are incorporated into the power system, the UC problem becomes more challenging. With the continued increase of wind and solar-based renewable energy in the utility power system on the supply side, the random features of the supply and demand sides of the power grid will become increasingly apparent, affecting the system's security, stability, and economical operation. In that sense, UC has theoretical and practical importance. The optimal scheduling of thermal, wind, solar, and EV units has been studied. The purpose of optimal scheduling is to minimize unit operating expenses. This study examines how the integration of a large percentage of renewable energy sources like wind and solar affects the effectiveness of short-term power system planning and control in urban areas where EVs charging stations and conventional demand coexist. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)is used to minimize the system's operational costs. The IEEE 24-bus test system is used to evaluate the study.

This study presents a novel methodology to strategically place electric vehicle aggregators along a feeder. This approach considers electrical variables and the dynamics of cloud movements within the study area. This innovative methodology reduces the substation’s power load demand and significantly improves the end user’s voltage levels. The improvements in voltage regulation and reduced demand on the substation provide clear benefits, including increased system resilience, better integration of renewable energy sources, and enhanced overall efficiency of the electric grid. These advantages are particularly critical in regions with high levels of photovoltaic generation and are important in promoting sustainable electric vehicle charging infrastructure. When analyzing different load scenarios for the IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder system, the consideration of distributed aggregators based on cloud movements decreased the power required at the substation by 21.25%, and the voltage drop in loads was reduced from 6.9% to 4.29%.

It allows industries and consumers, including knowledgeable prosumers, to trade excess energy with distributed generation sources, such as solar, wind, and electric vehicles, thus promoting a significant reduction in overall energy consumption. Real-Time Pricing (RTP) is increasingly essential in integrating smart home device Demand Response (DR) strategies. RTP improves energy management and enables customers to respond intelligently to price fluctuations. In this vein, this paper proves how DR and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading could affect energy prices by allowing producers (consumers) and smart home users to interact directly rather than through the traditional grid. The two-pronged planning approach substantially contributes to the reduction of electricity costs. DR enables P2P energy trading, while deep learning algorithms adapt smart home devices to RTP dynamics. Simulation results show that using P2P energy trading and DR in smart homes can significantly eliminate costs. This hybrid approach increases the energy efficiency of Smart Grid (SG) 2.0 technology and makes it more adaptable and cost-effective. © 2024, Dr D. Pylarinos.

Electrified steel plants based on electronic arc furnaces (EAF) can reduce most carbon emissions compared with traditional steel production methods, but the production steps have fixed electricity consumption behavior, and impact loads are easily generated in the production process, which has an impact on the stability of the power system. EV has the characteristics of a mobile energy storage unit. When a large number of EVs are connected to the power grid, they can be regarded as distributed energy storage units with scheduling flexibility. Through the orderly scheduling of EVs, the spatial–temporal transfer of EV charging and discharging load can be realized. Therefore, the EV situated in the steel plant’s distribution network node has the capacity to be utilized by providing peak shaving and valley filling services for the steel production load. This study proposes an operation optimization scheduling method for EVs and steel plants. Taking the lowest overall operating cost as the objective, an optimal scheduling model considering EVs operation, steel plant, and distributed generator is established. Based on the IEEE-33 node distribution network model considering distributed generators, the proposed model is simulated and analyzed, and the effectiveness of the EV steel plant operation optimization scheduling strategy is investigated. © 2024 by the authors.","charging and discharging strategy; electric vehicle; optimization scheduling; steel; unit commitment; vehicle-to-grid","Carbon; Charging (batteries); Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Steelmaking; Vehicle-to-grid; Carbon emissions; Charging and discharging strategy; Distributed generators; Energy storage unit; Operations optimization; Optimization scheduling; Scheduling strategies; Steel production; Unit Commitment; Vehicle to grids; Electric vehicles","This research was funded by the Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program (BE2020081-2).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195832916"

A key challenge associated with the wide-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is the impact of charging on distribution networks. The problem is further exacerbated in dense urban regions, where space is intrinsically limited. If the grid infrastructure is too constrained, it will dictate locations where EV chargers can be deployed without the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. In dense urban regions, this may hinder or slow down adoption. This paper investigates the impact of EV charging on the distribution grid in dense urban regions, with a focus on a case study based in Harlem, a neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City (NYC). The impact of EV charging on the distribution grid depends on several factors, including the number of charging stations, their locations, and the charging demand they result in, which also relate to consumers’ charging behavior. To evaluate this impact, load flow analysis was carried out for a futuristic scenario assuming all personal cars become EVs, with a focus on voltage drop and transformer/feeder overloading. It was found that with proper siting of chargers and scheduling for charging the distribution grid can handle a 100% EV scenario without infrastructure upgrade. © 2024","Charging stations; Curbside chargers; Direct-Current Fast Charger (DCFC); Electric vehicles; Grid-impact analysis; Level 2 chargers; Public chargers","Charging (batteries); Consumer behavior; Electric load flow; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Global warming; Military vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging station; Curbside charger; Direct-current; Direct-current fast charger; Distribution grid; Fast chargers; Grid impact analysis; Level 2; Level 2 charger; Public charger; Electric power distribution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193080600"

Moreover, hydrogen has become a promising energy carrier and green fuel to decarbonize the industrial and transportation sectors. In this context, this research investigates a wind-photovoltaic power plant to produce green hydrogen for hydrogen refueling station and to operate an electrocoagulation water treatment unit in Ostrava, Czech Republic's northeast region. The study conducts a techno-economic analysis through HOMER Pro® software for optimal sizing of the power station components and to investigate the economic indices of the plant. The power station employs photovoltaic panels and wind turbines to supply the required electricity for electrolyzers and electrocoagulation reactors. As an off-grid system, lead acid batteries are utilized to store the surplus electricity. Wind speed and solar irradiation are the key role site dependent parameters that determine the cost of hydrogen, electricity, and wastewater treatment. The simulated model considers the capital, operating, and replacement costs for system components. In the proposed system, 240 kg of hydrogen as well as 720 kWh electrical energy are daily required for the hydrogen refueling station and the electrocoagulation unit, respectively. Accordingly, the power station annually generates 6,997,990 kWh of electrical energy in addition to 85595 kg of green hydrogen. Based on the economic analysis, the project's NPC is determined to be €5.49 M and the levelized cost of Hydrogen (LCH) is 2.89 €/kg excluding compressor unit costs. This value proves the effectiveness of this power system, which encourages the utilization of green hydrogen for fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCVs).

This paper proposes a novel approach that combines different energy models to plan the infrastructure for supplying the energy demand of new, decarbonized, and highly electrified urban districts on a real-world scale. First, a model for energy management in buildings is used to plan and operate equipment for heating, cooling, and solar photovoltaic distributed generation. Second, a model that plans electric vehicle charging infrastructure determines the number and types of charging stations. Then, a large-scale distribution network planning model designs a cost-efficient electricity distribution grid to supply the district. A case study is presented for a new urban district in Madrid, Spain, to demonstrate how this approach can be applied to energy infrastructure planning in a real-world context. This case study presents different scenarios of energy efficiency performances in buildings and penetration levels of solar installations, electric vehicles, and heating and cooling systems. The results show that even in a high electrification scenario, improving energy efficiency in buildings through a district heating network based on heat pumps can lead to a lower peak electricity demand. This peak load reduction allows for integrating more electric vehicles, avoiding further investments in the electricity distribution network. In addition, the results confirm that a highly electrified scenario, which combines energy-efficient buildings with high integration of solar and electric vehicles, significantly reduces non-renewable energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. © 2024 The Authors","Distribution network planning; Electric vehicles; Grid-interactive efficient buildings; Heat pumps; Smart districts","Cooling systems; District heating; Electric loads; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Housing; Urban transportation; Case-studies; Distribution networks planning; Efficient buildings; Energy demands; Energy infrastructures; Greenhouse gas emissions; Grid-interactive efficient building; Heat pumps; Real-world; Smart district; Investments","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191293678"

The energy consumption of an EV is primarily influenced by distance travelled, which is affected by factors such as traffic congestion and road network design. To consider all these factors, a weighted graph is constructed using the layout of Lombardy's traffic network in northern Italy. The traffic flow patterns are simulated utilizing a regional travel survey that provides the trips between the 1450 different travel zones of the region. The trips are simulated within the roads graph using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fastest paths. The spatial resolution of the trips’ origins and destinations is increased using a further sectionalization of the region and gravity model using GIS-empowered probability density functions. The output from the traffic simulation is overlaid with the service areas of primary substations to estimate the added load from EVs. This integration of the two layers enables the identification of when, where, and to what extent electric mobility will impact the electric distribution grids. The novelties of the research work encompass the following key contributions: modelling a large-scale and real-world transportation network represented in graph theory and integration with the corresponding primary substation service areas, consequently enabling the estimation of added load from EVs with a high spatial–temporal resolution. © 2024","Distribution network; e-mobility; Geo-referenced data; Graph theory; Spatial–temporal distribution; Traffic flow","Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Flow graphs; Geographic information systems; Highway planning; Motor transportation; Probability density function; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Distribution grid; E mobilities; Electric mobility; Energy-consumption; Geo-referenced data; Power demands; Service area; Spatial-temporal distribution; Systems approach; Traffic flow; Energy utilization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190720615"

One of the biggest challenges in TEP with EVs and RESs is the uncertainty inherent in their behaviors. Managing this uncertainty is critical for ensuring the grid's reliability and resilience, and for facilitating a seamless transition to EVs. A potent method for addressing uncertainties in power systems is the application of a scenario-based approach. However, the efficiency of this approach is contingent upon an increase in the number of representative scenarios, which, in turn, escalates computational time, making solving the TEP problem a crucial task. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-objective resilience model for TEP, to advance towards more sustainable energy systems. The model seeks to strike a balance between economic, environmental, and technical considerations by minimizing planning costs, carbon dioxide emissions, and enhancing the voltage profile. Furthermore, the paper proposes a cascaded intelligent strategy to handle uncertainties and reduce computational complexity by reducing the number of representative scenarios without compromising system reliability. The adaptive neuro-inference system is designed to manage long-term uncertainties, while two fuzzy systems are developed to address short-term uncertainties. The problem is formulated as a complex non-linear multi-objective optimization problem. To address this, a hybrid approach combining the mountain gazelle optimizer and the multi-objective salp swarm optimizer is developed to solve the problem. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on two separate test systems, demonstrating its superiority in maintaining system reliability while reducing computing time by at least 92 % in comparison with the considered traditional methods. The results also highlight the superior performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm compared to existing meta-heuristic algorithms in solving the TEP. © 2024 The Authors","Electric vehicles; Fuzzy systems; Hybrid optimization algorithms; Renewable energy sources; Transmission expansion planning","Carbon dioxide; Electric power transmission; Energy conservation; Global warming; Heuristic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Reliability; Renewable energy; Vehicle transmissions; Hybrid optimization algorithm; Multi objective; Renewable energy source; Renewables; Storage systems; Sustainable energy systems; System reliability; Transmission expansion-planning; Uncertainty; Vehicle energy; Fuzzy systems","Funding text 1: The authors would like to express their profound gratitude to King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K.A.CARE) for their financial support in accomplishing this work.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Renewable Energy and Power Systems at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM) under Project INRE2324.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189856316"

The expansion and development of renewable power generation technologies is conducive in promoting the use of electric vehicles, which are more environmentally friendly. This paper proposes a multi-objective power expansion model considering renewable energy policy objectives. The model regards the problem as a multi-period optimisation task, taking the newly installed capacity and the power generation capacity of each power generation technology as decision variables, and simulating the uncertain factors in the planning process using Geometric Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo approaches. The optimisation objective of the model is to minimise expected costs, reduce risk and environmental impacts, and incorporate changing policy objectives into the constraints to meet policy makers’ expectations for renewable energy development. Then, a decentralised target search-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Its effectiveness is verified by a numerical example using real data from the Chinese power system. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits improved performance compared with benchmark algorithms and provides high quality and diverse Pareto-optimal solutions to decision makers.

As smart grids increasingly incorporate decentralized prosumers, innovative coordination strategies are essential to fully exploit their potential and improve system self-healing capabilities. To address this need, this paper presents a novel bi-level strategy for managing the self-healing process within a smart grid influenced by Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRSs), Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs), and energy hubs. This approach taps into the combined potential of these prosumers to boost system self-healing speed and reliability. In the initial stage, the Smart Grid Operator (SGO) conducts self-healing planning during emergencies, communicating required nodal capacities to prevent forced load shedding and outlining incentives for smart prosumers. Subsequently, prosumers schedule their activities and contribute flexible capacities to the SGO. Bridging the first and second stages, an adaptive Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm ensures convergence between the SGO and prosumer schedules within a decentralized framework. This strategy underwent implementation on a 118-node distribution system using GAMS. Results demonstrate that the proposed concept reduces Forced Load Shedding (FLS) by 32.04% and self-healing costs by 17.48% through effective utilization of smart prosumers' flexible capacities. Furthermore, outcomes indicate that the SGO reduces FLS by 6.69% by deploying Mobile Electrical Energy Storages (MEESs) and Mobile Fuel Cell Trucks (MFCTs) to critical nodes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Alternating direction method of multipliers; Energy hubs; Hydrogen energy; Self-healing; Smart grids; Vehicle-to-grid services","Electric load shedding; Electric power distribution; Electric power plant loads; Optimization; Self-healing materials; Smart power grids; Alternating directions method of multipliers; Energy hubs; Grid operators; Grid services; Hydrogen Energy; Load-shedding; Self-healing; Smart grid; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid service; Fuel cells; algorithm; convergence; distribution system; electric vehicle; energy storage; optimization; smart grid","Funding text 1: This research has benefited from the funding of the program Strategic projects oriented to the ecological transition and digital transition with NextGenerationEU/PRTR funds of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/State Research Agency (project ‘‘Local markets for energy communities: designing efficient markets and assessing the integration from the electricity system perspective (OptiREC)’’, with reference number TED2021-131365B-C43.

The development of EV technology requires charging infrastructure, which must be considered in the Distribution System Expansion Planning (DSEP). Due to the presence of EV and the load they impose on the distribution system, the planning of EV charging stations is done simultaneously with the DSEP so that the system operator can properly consider the technical constraints of the network and operational constraints. This paper presents a bi-level model for EV charging station expansion planning. The main purpose of the first level problem is expansion planning of charging stations and distribution system. But the charging stations are mostly built by a merchant investor, and they do so when it is profitable and has a reasonable risk. Therefore, the merchant investor should be encouraged to build a charging station in the planned areas. For this reason, in the second level problem, the profitability of the charging station and its risk are examined. To solve this problem, genetic algorithm (GA) has been used.

The integration of EVCS into the current distribution grid poses challenges due to potential power losses and voltage variations beyond acceptable limits. This complexity is heightened by the growing penetration of randomly dispersed solar-based distributed generation (SDG) and battery energy storage system (BESS). To address these challenges, distribution static VAR compensator (DSVC) systems have been introduced, offering benefits such as enhanced power transfer capacity, improved voltage regulation, and increased system security without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades. This study offers SCOPE, a novel multi-objective framework that unifies the optimization goals of minimizing real power loss, lowering bus voltage variation, maximizing system voltage stability, minimizing system operating costs, and mitigating CO<inf>2</inf> emissions.

The proposed model accounts for vehicle to grid (V2G) capabilities and the actual driving patterns of users over a 24-h horizon. The formulation of a smart microgrid (SMG) structure is based on modifying the standard IEEE 33-bus test radial distribution network (RDN), comprising three interconnected SMGs serving residential, commercial, and industrial users. The optimization approach based on IBESA is utilized to optimize both the siting and capacity of EVCS as well as renewable energy sources (RESs).

In Bakhshayesh and Kebriaei (2022), the problem of choosing the route and CSs of EVs is modeled as a non-cooperative game of selfish EVs with probabilistic decision strategies. In this paper, we have proposed a linear pricing policy that ensures global efficiency of the obtained Nash strategies of EVs in Bakhshayesh and Kebriaei (2022) for the Smart City Coordinator (SCC). We model the problem as a hierarchical game with a SCC as the leader and EVs as the followers. The leader aims to design optimal price functions of CSs and Traffic Coordinator (TC) and impose them on the EVs to maximize the social profits of CSs and TC. In response, the followers play a non-cooperative game with coupling constraints to optimally decide on their route and charging destination. Thus, we have a Stackelberg Game (SG) between SCC and EVs and also a Nash game among the EVs in the lower level. Compared to the conventional Nash-based pricing policies, our proposed functional SG formulation enables the possibility of simultaneous and global-optimum management of traffic and CSs' crowdedness. Moreover, we have proposed a two-level decentralized algorithm that preserves the privacy of EVs and have considered a decentralized computation for equilibrium seeking of followers based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method. Finally, we carry out simulation studies on the transportation network of Sioux Falls City to compare and evaluate the proposed method. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","decentralized algorithm; electric vehicle; Pricing mechanism; route and destination planning; Stackelberg game","Electric vehicles; Game theory; Markov processes; Smart city; Transportation routes; Charging station; Decentralised; Decentralized algorithms; Game; Power; Power system; Pricing mechanism; Road; Route and destination planning; Stackelberg Games; Costs","This work was supported by the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) under Grant 4021352.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184800261"

Moreover, they are unable to provide online real-time decision-making under a variety of uncertain factors. To address these problems, this paper first establishes a bilevel stochastic optimization model for EV charging navigation considering various uncertainties, and then proposes an EV charging navigation method based on the hierarchical enhanced deep Q network (HEDQN) to solve the above stochastic optimization model in real-time. The proposed HEDQN contains two enhanced deep Q networks, which are utilized to optimize the charging destination and charging route path of EVs, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is simulated and validated in two urban transportation networks. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, single-layer deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and traditional hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the proposed HEDQN algorithm can effectively reduce the total charging cost of electric vehicles and realize online real-time charging navigation of electric vehicles, that shows excellent generalization ability and scalability. © 2024","Charging navigation; Destination optimization; Electric vehicle; Hierarchical reinforcement learning; Route planning","Air navigation; Charging (batteries); Decision making; Electric vehicles; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Motion planning; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Smart power grids; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Urban transportation; Charging navigation; Destination optimization; Electric vehicle charging; Hierarchical reinforcement learning; Navigation methods; Optimisations; Real- time; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Route planning; Stochastic optimization model; Deep learning","This work is partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of the Fujian Province under Grant 2022J05125 , the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52007066 and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province , China under Grant 2021A1515010584 .","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183978288"

The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the adverse effects of greenhouse gas (CO<inf>2</inf>, NOx) emissions from huge conventional power plants, forced the environmentalists and power system engineers to come up with an alternative solution for more reliable and economical generation and distribution of electricity. The alternating current optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem is an effective tool for analysis, which involves the adjustment of certain controllable variables to optimize objective functions while satisfying operational, physical, and security limits on various controls and dependent variables. This paper focuses on analyzing the optimal power flow operation of a system with renewable integration, taking into account more popular wind and solar resources along with electric vehicles and tidal energy systems. In this context, proposed a model of the optimal power flow problem incorporating thermal-hydro-solar-wind-tidal-EV energy systems. Probability distribution functions (Weibull, Gumbel, and Lognormal) are used for renewable uncertainties and to determine predictable wind and solar power for proper generation scheduling. Furthermore, this paper provides solutions to the optimal power flow problem by including test cases of stochastic renewables involving minimizing the cost of power generation, minimizing emissions from fossil-fuelled plants, minimizing losses in the system, maximizing profit, and maximizing voltage stability. The generalized normal distribution optimization algorithm is applied to handle the above-mentioned AC-OPF problems in contingency conditions. The proposed method is employed on a modified IEEE 30-bus system integrated with RESs to assess the accuracy and performance. Statistical analysis and comparison of the results establish the superiority and robustness of the proposed algorithm over other available techniques in the literature. Simulation solutions indicate that the recommended optimization can achieve reasonable techno-economic results. Such optimum performance is expected to increase the power systems towards net zero and use renewable energy sources. © 2024 The Authors","Electric vehicles; Emission; Generalized normal distribution optimization; Hydro Power; Optimal power flow; Probability distribution function; Solar energy; Tidal energy; Wind energy","Cost benefit analysis; Distribution functions; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power plants; Normal distribution; Operating costs; Optimization; Population statistics; Solar energy; Tidal power; Weibull distribution; Distribution optimization; Emission; Generalized normal distribution; Generalized normal distribution optimization; Hydro power; Optimal power flow problem; Optimal power flows; Optimization algorithms; Probability distribution functions; Tidal energy; Wind power","The author extends their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University, Saudi Arabia for funding this work through the Research Group Program under Grant No: RGP 2/309/44 .","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183972920"

This approach plays a crucial role in addressing global greenhouse emissions and pollution problems. However, mass integration of EVs imposes unprecedented challenges to electrical power systems, especially to their distribution grids. These challenges range from planning issues, where the traditional panning procedures are not adequate for integration of EVs and their charging stations, to operational challenges, where a huge number of dispersed EVs can cause peak load increase, voltage violations, congestions, feeder overloads, etc. Hence, despite the significant importance of maximizing the deployment of EVs, their stochastic integration can give rise to critical challenges in electric power systems, thereby impeding their subsequent expansion. Therefore, in order to properly integrate mass amounts of EVs, without causing technical violations in the electrical power system, intelligent software tools are required, to aid distribution system operators and engineers in the transition to a new era of electrified transportation. In this paper, we argue that novel software solutions called Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMSs) are a key solution for enabling a safe integration of mass amounts of EVs into emerging distribution grids. Specifically, we introduce a novel Hybrid DERMS framework, as an integration of multiple hierarchical levels of DER management solutions, and propose this solution as a suitable instrument for distribution system operators and grid engineers to safely integrate and manage high volumes of EVs within the grid infrastructure. The hypothesis is validated through a real-life use case for integration and management of high amounts of EVs into an existing distribution grid, using an industrial DERMS solution. Specifically, an in-depth analysis of adding two large charging stations, boasting capacities of 5 MW each, has been performed through all stages of integration, from the planning stage, up to using their flexible output to manage technical constraint violations in real time. The influence of these EV charging stations on both the feeder where they are planned to be integrated, as well as on the entire supply substation, have been analyzed in detail. The resultant findings, especially on successfully managing overloads, peak load increases, as well as voltage violations through intelligent use of aggregated EVs through DERMS, have proven to be notably encouraging, further substantiating the paper's hypothesis. © 2024 The Author(s)","","Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Energy management; Energy management systems; Integration; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Stochastic systems; Charging station; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution grid; Distribution systems; Electrical power system; Energy resource managements; Mass integration; Peak load; Resource management systems; Voltage violation; Electric vehicles","The authors thank Schneider Elctric LLC Novi Sad for their support of this research, as well as for allowing us to use their DERMS software for all phases of the presented research.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183473589"

It needs to be supported by an effective EV charging and discharging behavior control strategy to meet the operation demand of the power system. An optimization model with the objectives of minimizing grid load variance and minimizing user charging cost is established. An improved hybrid algorithm is proposed for the optimal allocation of charging and discharging power of EVs by combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The performance of variant algorithm is tested using CEC2005 benchmarking functions sets and applied to the solution of the ordered charge–discharge optimal scheduling model. The results show that the convergence accuracy of the algorithm is better than the traditional algorithm, and it can effectively balance exploration and exploitation ability of the particles. In addition, the scheduling analysis is performed for different charging strategies of EVs. The scheduling results show that with the same optimization weights, implementing the ordered charging and discharging strategy can significantly reduce the charging cost of users and the load variance of the grid. Thus, the operational stability of the grid and the economic benefits for users are improved. © 2024 The Authors","Electric vehicles; Gravitational search algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Power grid","Benchmarking; Charging (batteries); Electric discharges; Electric loads; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; Learning algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Vehicle-to-grid; Gravitational search algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimal scheduling; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Power; Power grids; Search Algorithms; Swarm optimization; Multiobjective optimization","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182882958"

Consequently, suboptimal choices regarding the location and size of PEVF-CSs may lead to increasing travel time and traffic congestion in transportation networks and deterioration of the power quality indexes in power distribution networks. Also, each PEVF-CS is equipped with power electronic converters that can be used as power line conditioners and active filters to compensate for the reactive power and current harmonic components due to nonlinear loads and reduce the power loss. Thus, PEVF-CSs can improve the voltage profile, decrease voltage THD, and reduce the power loss in power distribution networks. Accordingly, this paper develops a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) to determine the optimal locations and sizes of PEVF-CSs. In addition, the proposed model considers traffic congestion and power quality in the coupled transportation and power distribution networks. The model considers various load profiles and origin-destination demands to address the different operational aspects of transportation and power distribution networks. The main features of the proposed model are 1- road congestion reduction, 2- traveling time reduction, 3- power loss reduction, and 4- power quality improvement.

This paper analyzes the impacts of DLC programs on the transition to renewable energy within the European electricity system towards 2060. The study quantifies the achievable hourly potential for DLC across Europe in the residential sector. By implementing and developing a DLC module within the stochastic capacity expansion model EMPIRE, we investigate how costs, long-term investments, and long-term marginal prices are affected by residential DLC participation rates. The research utilizes a comprehensive DLC dataset, including ten appliances such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, refrigeration, and others. This dataset serves as the basis for creating four storylines to investigate the integration of these programs into the European electricity system. The results indicate that residential DLC programs have some impact on grid-battery deployment, PV plant penetration, and electricity prices. In the best-case scenario, involving ambitious participation of residential loads in DLC programs without compensation, cost savings are about 1% versus not introducing DLC. The findings contribute to understanding the value of demand response programs in Europe, indicating that the savings they bring might not be sufficient to provide enough incentives or compensation for widespread participation in such programs.

The model is comprehensively formulated to encompass Distributed Generation (DG) resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs), and Capacitor Banks (CBs), alongside traditional expansion options like substations and circuit construction/reinforcement. The essence of this Distribution System Expansion Planning (DSEP) problem formulation lies in its stochastic approach, featuring chance constraints to effectively manage and address uncertainties. The central objective of the model is to minimize the total investment and operational expenditures associated with the DSEP problem over a designated planning horizon. The rigorous application of optimization techniques ensures the convergence of the MILP model, thereby delivering an efficient and reliable solution. The model's effectiveness is initially assessed using an 18-bus system, followed by comprehensive testing on a larger 123- bus system to gauge its robustness. Thorough performance evaluations are conducted across various case studies, encompassing both the 18- bus and 123- bus systems, culminating in the validation of the model's resilience, scalability, and replicability. These case studies encompass deterministic and stochastic methodologies across six distinct scenarios. The numerical outcomes conclusively demonstrate that the DSEP solution, when utilizing the stochastic approach without considering EVCSs, is associated with elevated costs. However, with a strategic allocation strategy for EVCSs, noteworthy reductions in investment expenditures related to substations, lines, and overall costs are notably achieved. The incorporation of uncertainty management within the DSEP problem underscores the flexibility and adaptability intrinsic to the proposed stochastic MILP model. These attributes render it ideally suited to effectively orchestrating the expansion of multi-energy distribution networks in the presence of EVCSs, thereby enhancing its utility and relevance in addressing modern energy distribution challenges. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Chance constraint; Distributed generation; Distribution network; Electric vehicle charging stations; Electric vehicles; Expansion planning multi-energy; Stochastic model","Charging (batteries); Electric network parameters; Electric substations; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Investments; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Chance constraint; Charging station; Distribution system expansion planning; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Expansion planning; Expansion planning multi-energy; Mixed integer linear programming model; Multi energy; Stochastic-modeling; Distributed power generation","None.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179583308"

At the upper level, a distribution company decides the optimal deployment of WCL, subject to PDN constraints. With the upper-level WCL deployment decisions, in the lower level, each EV makes optimal routing and charging decisions to minimize the sum of its travel and charging costs. The proposed bilevel model is reformulated to a single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) by replacing the lower-level problem with its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions.

The accurate forecast of EVs charging demand enables the proposed model to optimally determine the location of common prime urban parking lots (PLs) including residential, offices, food centers, shopping malls, and public parks. By incorporating both macro- and micro-level parameters, the agents used in this framework provide significant benefits to all stakeholders, including EV owners, PL operators, PL aggregators, and distribution network operators. Furthermore, the path tracing algorithm is employed to find the nearest PL for the EVs and the probabilistic method is applied to evaluate the uncertainties of driving patterns of EV drivers and the weather conditions. The simulation has been carried out in an agent-based modeling (ABM) software called NETLOGO with the traffic and weather data of the city of Newcastle Upon Tyne, while the IEEE 33 bus system is mapped on the traffic map of the city. The findings reveal that the total charging demand of EVs is significantly higher on a sunny weekday than on a rainy weekday during peak hours, with an increase of over 150 kW. Furthermore, on weekdays higher load demand could be seen during the nighttime as opposed to weekends where the load demand usually increases during the daytime. © 2015 IEEE.","Electric vehicle (EV); multiagent framework; parking lot (PL); PL aggregator; power forecast; power tracing algorithm; urban planning","Autonomous agents; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Computational methods; Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Forecasting; Meteorology; Multi agent systems; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Urban planning; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery; Electric vehicle charging; Multiagent framework; Parking lot aggregator; Parking lots; Power forecast; Power tracing algorithm; Power tracings; Renewable energy source; Road; States of charges; Tracing algorithm; Electric vehicles","This work was supported in part by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, under Grant RG-9-135-43; and in part by DTE Network+ by EPSRC under Grant EP/S032053/1.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165247796"

First, demand-side adjustment, which involves adjusting the power of the ship's electric propulsion motors and flexible service loads, is integrated into the energy management problem. Second, HP3O algorithm is employed to obtain both continuous and discrete variables simultaneously. It utilizes a continuous actor network to obtain continuous variables, such as the generator's power and ship cruising speed, while employing a discrete actor network to determine discrete variables, i.e., the on/off status of the generators. Third, to handle complex constraints reasonably, the energy management problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and an action mask mechanism is also integrated into the energy management framework to make agent's actions more reliable. The simulation results of an all-electric cruise ship validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy in achieving near-optimal scheduling while satisfying operation constraints.

To quantify the temporal and spatial flexibility of EVs for charging and discharging, a novel dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem is proposed. The DTA problem is based on a link transmission model (LTM) with extended charging links, depicting the interaction between EVs and power systems. It models the charging rates as continuous variables by an energy boundary model. To consider the evacuation requirements of TNs and the uncertainties of traffic conditions, the DTA problem is extended to a two-stage distributionally robust version. It is further incorporated into a two-stage distributionally robust unit commitment problem to balance the enhancement of EPNs and the performance of TNs. The problem is reformulated into a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved by off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Case studies are performed on two test networks.

EV and DG coordination optimization with the use of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology along with system reconfiguration optimization is developed to provide collective revenues and address integrational complications that may occur by additional system loading due to EV charging and EV-DG energy exchanges. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizes the EV charging/discharging in synergies with renewable DGs to maximize benefits that can be captured by their collaborative participation in electricity market and through renewable energy arbitrage. The developed EV charging/discharging optimization is implemented in a real 134-bus distribution network and is evaluated for its potential operational implications, namely, increased system losses. A system reconfiguration is then proposed to reduce the system losses by optimizing the flow of power through switching on/off the connections within the micro-grid and/or with other distribution systems. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in not only providing collective revenues, but also in enhancing the system operation by reducing the losses of the distribution grid.

Within the framework of a demand response program, the HEM system adjusts the ON/OFF states and operations of household devices to minimize energy costs and peak loads. This involves addressing a constrained multi-objective optimization problem that includes integer decision parameters. Two deficiencies exist in current methods for scheduling domestic device operation. Firstly, user satisfaction is often overlooked, and secondly, there is a lack of an effective global optimization algorithm to solve the problem. In this study, the optimization of domestic appliance planning in the HEM system is conceptualized as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, employing the Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA). Ten different case studies are conducted to determine the optimal planning of devices based on various demand response programs. Two smart houses, each with 10 and 11 devices, including electric vehicles as significant domestic loads, are considered. To accurately estimate the total load demand, a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed for predicting smart building load demand. The system's validity and model performance are assessed by applying results to the digital twin of the smart building and later to the real test system. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional algorithms such as WOA, PSO, DEA, and dragonfly algorithms.

In this regard, the installation of photovoltaic-battery systems may help to mitigate the negative effects of charging points. However, such assets should be carefully planned, paying attention to economic aspects, principally. Most of existing works optimize the photovoltaic-battery system in charging infrastructures taking a representative-space of the involved variables (e.g. photovoltaic potential, charging demand or energy prices). However, this approach tends to ignore low-probable scenarios. Thus, the best-case scenario for charging demand (i.e. that for which the highest charging profit is accessible) may not be included in the analysis and therefore such demand could be not attended properly, thus losing this monetary opportunity. This paper focuses on this issue and questions if considering the best-case scenario into planning photovoltaic-battery systems for charging stations is worthwhile or not. To this end, a novel best-case-aware planning tool is developed, including the best-case scenario through a novel chance-constrained formulation. The overall problem is then decomposed into a master-slave structure by which the economy of the system is optimized together with the number of scenarios for which the best-case profile can be attended. A case study serves to validate the developed tool and shed light on the questions arisen in this work. In particular, it is checked that considering the best-case scenario into planning tools is questionable from a monetary point of view. Nevertheless, its inclusion unlocks some collateral advantages such as incrementing the users’ satisfaction or reducing the grid-dependency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage; Chance-constrained programming; Electric vehicle; Photovoltaic energy; Renewable energy","Charging (batteries); Computer programming; Economics; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage; Chance-constrained programming; Charging demands; Charging station; Multimodes; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic/battery systems; Planning tools; Power; Renewable energies; Photovoltaic effects; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy storage; fuel cell; photovoltaic system","Marcos Tostado-Véliz and Francisco Jurado wish to thank to the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, under the research Project “Desarrollo de herramientascomputacionales para microrredes multi-energía con vectores de elec-tricidad, hidrógeno y gas” (TED2021-129631B-C31).

In this study, considering charge and discharge management of plug-in electric vehicles and intermittent photovoltaics, a novel Multi-energy synergy systems scheduling framework is developed for solving grid instability and unreliability issues. This formulates a large-scale mixed-integer problem, which calls for a powerful and effective optimizer. The new binary level-based learning optimization algorithm is proposed to address nonlinear large-scale high-coupling unit commitment problems. To investigate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, numerical experiments have been carried out considering multiple scales of unit numbers and various scenarios. Finally, the results confirm that the proposed scheduling framework is reasonable and effective in solving unit commitment problems, can achieve 3.3% cost reduction and demonstrates superior performance in handling large-scale energy optimization problems. The integration of plug-in electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy generations, and battery energy storage systems is verified to reduce the output power of 192.72 MW units during peak periods to improve grid stability. Therefore, optimizing energy utilization and distribution will become an indispensable part of future power systems. © 2024","Battery energy storage system; Electric vehicle; Renewable energy; Synergy optimization; Unit commitment","Cost reduction; Electric discharges; Electric power distribution; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Plug-in electric vehicles; Renewable energy; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Distributed renewable energy generations; Large-scales; Multi energy; Optimisations; Photovoltaics; Renewable energies; Scheduling frameworks; Synergy optimization; Unit Commitment; Integer programming","This research is financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 52077213 and 62003332 , and Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS 2021358 , and Shenzhen Science and Technology Research and Development Fund JCYJ20200109114839874 , and NSFC-FDCT under its Joint Scientific Research Project Fund (Grant No. 0051/2022/AFJ ), China & Macau.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185199753"

This requires the system operators to manage available resources and utilize suitable risk management tools to control and study uncertainties and their potential consequences. This paper proposes an uncertainty-based optimization framework based on the robust optimization and scenario methodology for optimal sizing and siting of electrical vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The proposed model seeks to take advantage of the flexibility introduced by EVCSs and gain financial profit for the operator of the power distribution system through reducing power losses and offering services to electricity markets. To handle the uncertainties posed by different resources, two risk measures are employed simultaneously. The uncertainty originating from the state of charge (SOC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is addressed through stochastic programming, while the robust optimization method (ROM) enables the operator of the power distribution system to be informed of the consequences of uncertainty in electricity load. Therefore, appropriate strategies can be taken to tackle the uncertainties while keeping the system operation stable and gaining financial profit. Thus, three strategies are studied in the proposed model as follows: risk-neutral, risk-averse, and risk-taker. In addition, the non-linear terms in power flow modeling were linearized through a set of linear functions which transforms the proposed model to a MILP problem. The IEEE 33-bus test system under different levels of load uncertainty and considering the uncertainty in SOC of EVs is utilized to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results highlight the efficiency of the proposed model in considering uncertainties and taking advantage of the consideration of different risk attitudes by the decision-maker that ROM provides for the optimal operation of the power distribution system. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Electric vehicles charging stations (EVCSs); power distribution systems; robust optimization method (ROM); scenario method; uncertainty management","Charging (batteries); Decision making; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Integer programming; Mathematical transformations; Profitability; Risk assessment; Risk management; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Optimal sizing; Power-distribution system; Robust optimization method; Scenario methods; Uncertainty; Uncertainty management; Electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180319591"

A number of studies have shown that second-life batteries (SLBs) from EVs usually have a considerable remaining capacity and hence still have additional utilization value. This article proposes a novel fuzzy inference system (FIS)-based planning framework for EV charging stations with wind, PV power, battery energy storage system and the utilization of SLBs (EVCS-WPE-SLBs system). In this framework, a narrowed and the most probable candidate node set for EVCS-WPE-SLBs system which makes the trade-off of several off-site factors from different fields that jointly determine the optimal planning results is obtained, including the installation and utilization requirements of SLBs, the transportation network features and power system properties. Numerical case studies are conducted on a coupled IEEE 33-bus distribution system and 25-node transportation system. According to the simulation results, the reasonable utilization of SLBs in the EVCS-WPE-SLBs system can reduce the total system cost while maintaining the normal operation of the system. Besides, a narrowed and most probable candidate node set not only reduces the search space and simplifies the optimization problem, but the results obtained are more practical according to the actual system conditions in real life. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","battery energy storage system; EV charging station planning; fuzzy inference system; renewable energy; second-life batteries (SLBs)","Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Economic and social effects; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Secondary batteries; Battery; Battery energy storage systems; Charging station planning; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station planning; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy-Logic; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Second life batteries; Second-life battery; US Department of Defence; Renewable energy resources","This work was supported in part by the ARC Research Hub under Grant IH180100020, in part by the ARC Training Centre under Grant IC200100023, in part by the ARC linkage project under Grant LP200100056, and in part by the ARC under Grant DP220103881.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174799849"

Harmonics are the reason for the disturbance in the technical constraints and quality of the power system. These disadvantages are formed in the current and the voltage of the system branches and buses. To reduce these harmonics, active and passive power filters are used. Since active power filters (APFs) include electronic power switching devices, they are used to eliminate or reduce current or voltage harmonics. To properly reduce these harmonics and supply consumer demand, private investors (PIs) are considered to enhance the power quality, by investing in the APF units and the distribution network operator (DNO) coordinating and feeding the EVs, by equipping the network with smart parking lots. Total harmonic distortion, bus voltage profile, active power loss and energy not supplied (ENS) are considered problem attributes. Using techniques for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS), it is determined how the addition of photovoltaic (PV), energy storage system, and batteries affects the ranking of attributes from the perspectives of both DNO and PI. The best solutions are obtained in the first stage using a genetic algorithm (GA), and the attributes have been prioritized from a utility perspective in the second stage by TOPSIS. To verify the performance of GA and TOPSIS, all of the obtained results are compared with the other algorithms. As seen clearly, active, reactive power loss and ENS in scenarios with the participation PV are reduced. Furthermore, comparing the results of different algorithms confirms the efficiency of GA and TOPSIS. © 2024 The Authors.

However, a major concern about electric vehicles is their compatibility with power grids. Adopting a whole-power-system approach, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the impacts and benefits of electric vehicles’ diffusion on a national power system, i.e., Italy. Demand and flexibility profiles are estimated with a detailed review of the literature on the topic, allowing us to put forward reliable charging profiles and the resulting flexibility, compatible with the Italian regulatory framework. Distribution network planning and power system dispatching are handled with dedicated models, while the uncertainty associated with EV charging behavior is managed with a Monte Carlo approach. The novelty of this study is considering a nationwide context, considering both transmission and distribution systems, and proposing a set of policies suitable for enabling flexibility provision. The results show that the power and energy demand created by the spread of EVs will have localized impacts on power and voltage limits of the distribution network, while the consequences for transmission grids and dispatching will be negligible. In 2030 scenarios, smart charging reduces grid elements’ violations (−23%, −100%), dispatching costs (−43%), and RES curtailment (−50%). © 2024 by the authors.","distribution planning; flexibility; power system dispatching; reserve margins; smart charging; vehicle–grid integration","Charging (batteries); Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Distribution networks planning; Distribution planning; Flexibility; Grid integration; Network power; Power system dispatching; Reserve margin; Smart charging; Transport sectors; Vehicle–grid integration; Electric power transmission","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191662887"

Existing research on systemic low-carbon emissions and electric vehicle charging and discharging issues is usually determined by considering only carbon trading markets or charging and discharging management on the source side. In this regard, a coordinated and optimized operation model that considers the participation of electric vehicle clusters in deep peaking and the source network load and storage adjustable resources is proposed. The upper layer establishes a real-time price-based demand response mechanism for the load side with the minimum net load fluctuation as the objective function; the middle layer establishes a comprehensive operation mechanism for the source and storage side that includes an orderly charging and discharging peaking compensation mechanism for electric vehicles, and a deep peaking mechanism that takes into account clean emission, and constructs an optimal operation model with the minimum comprehensive operating cost as the objective function; the lower layer establishes a distribution network loss minimization model for the network side that takes into account the orderly charging and discharging of electric vehicle as the objective function. The optimal load model with the objective function of minimizing the distribution network loss is established at the lower level. Finally, the original problem is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming problem, and the model's effectiveness is verified by setting different scenarios. The model reduces the total cost by 22.22%, improves the wind power consumption rate by 19.55%, reduces the actual carbon emission by 16.66%, and reduces the distribution network loss by 13.91% compared to the basic model. © 2024 The Authors.

The unplanned placement of EVCS raises various technical and economic issues in the distribution network, and it can lead to increased energy losses in the distribution system. Installing EVCSs and DGs at strategically chosen positions is essential to minimize the impact of EV load on the distribution network. To address these issues, this work has proposed a whale optimization technique (WOT) for optimizing the placement and sizing of EVCS and DG. This novel approach of formulating the multi-objective problem of allocating electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, along with DGs and capacitors simultaneously improves the voltage stability, minimizes active and reactive power losses in the radial distribution system, and requires execution time. A forward–backward power flow method has been carried out for load flow calculations. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been applied on the standard IEEE-33 and 69-bus test systems and the obtained results have been compared with the other latest optimization techniques. The simulation results validate the performance and effectiveness of the Whale Optimization Technique, and it has been analyzed that the optimized sizes and allocation of EVCSs, DGs, and capacitors lead to an extensive reduction in power losses of 81.33% and 80% in the case of active power and 78.46% and 80.26% in the case of reactive power for the IEEE-33 and 69-bus test systems, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Distributed generators; Electric vehicle charging station; Profiles of voltages; Radial systems; Reconfiguration; Whale optimization technique","Charging (batteries); Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric losses; Optimization; Reactive power; Bus test systems; Charging station; Distributed generators; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Optimization techniques; Profile of voltage; Radial systems; Reconfiguration; Whale optimization technique; Electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185272416"

The second stage applies the DAM results to the modelled TS to reveal any congestion issues. If congestion is depicted the need for congestion management (CM) by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) arises. Thus, the TSO performs an AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) analysis, under power loss minimization, to provide the redispatch schedule in the TS and quantify the power transactions between TSO and the Distribution System Operators (DSOs). Finally, the DSOs examine if they can deliver these power transactions without congestion in their DSs, by applying AC OPF to minimize power losses. If this is not possible, then a relaxation scheme is applied to these power transactions in order to define the maximum DSO flexibility without congestion in the DS.

This article proposes a hybrid method for the allocation of fast-charging stations (FCSs) and photovoltaic (PV) with battery energy storage (BES) and scheduling. The proposed hybrid technique is the wrapper of golden jackal optimization (GJO) and random forest algorithms (RFA), commonly named the GJO–RFA technique. Using the GJO approach, the allocation and EV assignment problems are resolved. RFA is used to address EV, traffic flow, and PV-related uncertainties. The objective of the proposed approach is to minimize the loss of energy, investments, index of voltage deviation, and operation and maintenance costs of FCS, PV, and BES. The associated important factors are also assessed, including the number of charging ports, FCS capacity, and EV flow caught using a FCS. As a test example, a 33-node radial distribution network with the appropriate traffic network is used. For the final problem, the proposed approach to minimal energy loss is 2622.7270 kWh.

Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) need to be properly located for widespread EV integration. The distribution system is facing additional challenges due to inclusion of EVCS. The adverse impacts of EVCS on the Radial Distribution Network (RDN) may be minimized using Distributed Generations (DGs) or Distribution Static Compensators (DSTATCOMs) or by reconfiguring the network. This paper uses a novel optimization technique to solve the problem of simultaneous optimal placement of EVCS with network reconfiguration and optimal planning (siting and sizing) of DGs and DSTATCOMs. The multiple objective functions are considered in order to minimize the active power losses, the voltage deviation, the investment costs for DGs and DSTATCOMs, and to increase the voltage stability of the system. A novel meta-heuristic Cheetah Optimization Algorithm (COA) is used to solve the optimization problem.

The presence of these stations is crucial in facilitating the provision of fuel for FCEVs, which rely on hydrogen as a source of power generation. Renewable energy sources offer significant advantages for hydrogen production at these stations, as they are environmentally friendly and can reduce costs. In this study, it is provided a techno-economic analysis of an on-site hydrogen refuelling station powered by a hybrid renewable energy generation system using HOMER software in Niğde, Türkiye, and Zaragoza, Spain. Three different power system scenarios were evaluated to refuel 24 vehicles per day for each region throughout the year. The results of the analysis showed that the most optimal system architecture for Niğde was with a solar panel power generation system, with a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 6.15 $/kg and the net present cost (NPC) of $6,832,393. The most optimal system architecture for Zaragoza was a wind turbine-photovoltaic panel power generation system, with an LCOH of 5.83 $/kg and NPC of $6,499,723. The annual amount of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions avoided by using renewable resources in hydrogen production was calculated as 2,673,453 kg for Niğde and 2,366,573 kg for Zaragoza. The study also found that the cost of hydrogen production increases with decreasing the HRS production capacity. The use of renewable energy generation systems for hydrogen production will enable countries to achieve net-zero emission targets and reduce the need to import fossil fuels to meet energy demands in the transportation sector.

Electric vehicles (EVs) offer advantages for distribution systems, such as increasing reliability and efficiency, reducing pollutant emissions, and decreasing dependence on non-endogenous resources. In addition, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology has made EVs a potential form of portable energy storage, alleviating the random fluctuation of renewable energy power. This paper simulates the optimal design of a photovoltaic/wind/battery hybrid energy system as a power system combined with an electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) using V2G technology in a grid-connected system. The rule-based energy management strategy (RB-EMS) is used to control and observe the proposed system power flow. A multi-objective improved arithmetic optimization algorithm (MOIAOA) concept is proposed to analyze the optimal sizing of the proposed system components by calculating the optimal values of the three conflicting objectives: grid contribution factor (GCF), levelled cost of electricity (LCOE), and energy sold to the grid ((Formula presented.)). This research uses a collection of meteorological data such as solar radiation, temperature, and wind speed captured every ten minutes for one year for a government building in Al-Najaf Governorate, Iraq. The results indicated that the optimal configuration of the proposed system using the MOIAOA method consists of eight photovoltaic modules, two wind turbines, and thirty-three storage batteries, while the fitness value is equal to 0.1522, the LCOE is equal to 2.66 × (Formula presented.) USD/kWh, the GCF is equal to 7.34 × (Formula presented.) kWh, and the (Formula presented.) is equal to 0.8409 kWh.

This load creates power quality issues like an increase in total harmonic distortion (THD) and a reduction in power factor.

The purpose of cost reduction in the presence of the intelligent environment is a challenge that must be investigated so that this platform is suitable for predicting the behaviour of vehicles and, as a result, optimizing their presence in the power network. This research presents a relatively complete radial distribution network development planning model in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the effects of electric vehicles are not considered, and only the effects of distributed production (renewable and dispatchable) are considered. Studies have been done on a sample 54-bus network, a common system in most Distribution expansion planning (DEP) articles for distribution networks. In addition, the real data of American highways have been used to create raw input data. Also, due to the distance limit, the information on vehicles under 100 miles has been received as electric vehicle information. The clustering method and Capiola multivariate probability distribution functions have created suitable vehicle scenarios during different planning years. Capiola's method increases the accuracy of vehicle load forecasting according to a predetermined growth rate. The DEP problem in this research is modeled as an optimization problem based on scenario, dynamic, and in 5 one-year time frames (5-year time horizon and one-year accuracy). The results indicate that, in the presence of electric vehicles and distributed production sources, the technical characteristics of the network are improved. Similarly, the use of DGs, in addition to reducing the cost of equipment, has reduced undistributed energy in the system. But 10,000 vehicles, which have been applied to the network as an uncontrolled load, have caused an increase in undistributed energy.

Since Pakistan's power distribution sector is not technically and financially sound, this research presents a framework for policy prescription to avoid dangerously burdening distribution companies or deteriorating the grid conditions. The EV load model considers EVs' arrival and departure times based on a survey of daily commuters. The Burr distribution function is used for selecting sizes of the PVs for grid integration because it best fits sampled data of installed PVs in the country. After stochastically selecting network nodes for integrating EVs and PVs to mimic their locational growth, technical and financial parameters are evaluated with and without the net metering effect. At peak PV hour and higher PV penetration of 50%, voltage limit conformance improves from 88% to 94% if net metering is not allowed. Results show that annual net revenue increases with rising EV penetration and always remains positive in the absence of PV. However, irrespective of EV penetration level, even 25% PV penetration and consequent loss of cash inflows lead to negative net revenues. The study concludes that excessive PV penetration with net metering causes voltage instability and negative net revenues, whereas EV integration can reduce both effects.

This article presents a strategy for calculating spatiotemporal operational emissions (OEs) of road transportation and the electric grid to quantify the impact of transportation electrification. Emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles and offset emissions from electric vehicles (EVs) are considered using actual transportation networks and travel data. The spatiotemporal charging demand for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EVs is estimated in a behaviorally informed way and mapped to electrical buses within the power grid and an ac optimal power flow with unit commitment is solved. The methodology is demonstrated with ten scenarios simulated on a grid with 7000 electrical buses geographically sited in Texas, created with actual generator data for the 2020 grid, and a future case, including anticipated generator updates by 2030. Results show overall transportation emission reductions in daily OEs of up to 20%-30% for all pollutants studied, outweighing the increase in emissions from the electric grid. Considering emissions on an hourly basis, up to approximately 1000% reduction in CO emissions is observed. © 2015 IEEE.","Charging; electric vehicles (EVs); emissions; power systems; transportation","Charging (batteries); Electric generators; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Magnetohydrodynamics; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging; Electric vehicle charging; Emission; Generator; Light medium; Load modeling; Power; Power system; Spatiotemporal phenomenon; Substation; Electric load flow","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162917113"

Consequently, using deterministic power flow (DPF) algorithms for EVCS planning is unreliable. To address this, we propose a probabilistic model for EV charging loads and introduce a novel dynamic system voltage stability (DSVS) index. We then present an effective optimization model for EVCS site and size planning using stochastic power flow (SPF). Our model aims to maximize capital gains on investment costs of EVCS, minimize yearly EV users' average wait time and distance to charge costs, and minimize the DSVS index. To simplify the problem, we use the super efficiency data envelopment analysis (SEDEA) method to determine objective weights and transform the multiobjective optimization problem into a single-objective one.

However, a growing body of recent studies has challenged the often-assumed notion that electric vehicles are often considered to be net-zero emissions. These studies suggest that electric vehicles could potentially generate substantial emissions due to their reliance on fossil fuels to generate electricity, especially when receiving fast charging services. This phenomenon has been mitigated with the use of renewable energy sources in the power system. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, additional requirements have arisen. To address this situation, this paper presents an interdisciplinary study of collaborative fast-charging stations (FCS) and distributed renewable energy planning based on the interactions between traffic and power networks in order to increase the adoption rate of electric vehicles and reduce emissions caused by traffic and power systems. The locations and sizing of fast-charging stations, distributed photovoltaic generation, and renewable energy power supply for electric vehicles are determined in the proposed strategy through multi-objective integer programming. The proposed planning strategy considers heterogeneous electric vehicle driving range constraints, the operation security of the power distribution system, the reliability and expansion of the current power distribution, as well as different types of air pollutant classifications resulting from the charging behaviors. To guarantee the feasibility and accuracy of the planning results, an interactive algorithm is applied to solve the multi-objective integer model. Several cases are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed planning strategy has good performance in the planning of fast-charging stations and distributed renewable energy integration. © 2024","Air pollutants; Driving range constraints; Electric vehicle; Emission constraints; Fast-charging station; Multi-objective planning model; PV installation; Renewable energy","Air pollution; Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Integer programming; Natural resources; Air pollutants; Driving range; Driving range constraint; Emission constraints; Fast charging stations; Multi-objective planning model; Planning strategies; PV installations; Range constraints; Renewable energies; Renewable energy","This work was supported by the ARC Reseach Hub Grant IH180100020 , the ARC Training Centre IC200100023, the ARC linkage project LP200100056 and ARC discovery project DP220103881.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184473237"

Then, the power system is evaluated to ensure compliance with security and stability requirements. The method innovatively combines an overall energy system analysis, from an energy planning perspective, with more detailed power system analyses, where the power balance at each instant is the main item of interest rather than the energy balance. The study, applied to Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain), demonstrates that 100% electrification of passenger cars with renewable energy sources is the optimal scenario, resulting in reductions of 45.86% and 45.1% in oil consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, respectively, compared to the reference scenario.

EV retailers, playing a critical role in the demand response mechanism, face market risks caused by uncertainties in electricity consumption and prices. To address the operational issues of large-scale EVs and tap the potential of EV retailers, a temporal and spatial domain-based optimization strategy is proposed, which is implemented on bi-level (referring to transmission and distribution grid networks). First, a physical scheduling model of the grid is established, consisting of a novel hybrid demand response mechanism considering the incentives of EV retailers and the retail electricity price of EV users, and a new robust retail electricity pricing strategy handling the uncertainties of EV behavior and the electric market. Then, a bi-level optimization strategy is presented: at the upper level, in the transmission network, based on the robust pricing strategy, a unit commitment model that coordinates the hybrid demand response with other distributed energy resources is designed to optimize load periods of EVs in the time domain; at the lower level, in the distribution network, an optimal power flow model is proposed to spatially dispatch the location of EV loads. The impacts of retail price profile, EV penetration, hybrid demand response mechanism, and EV load location are analyzed in ten tests using the IEEE 33 distribution network. Simulation results indicate that the robust pricing strategy can effectively handle uncertainties, the integration of the hybrid demand response mechanism into scheduling can ensure the benefits of all participants, and the bi-level optimization strategy can accommodate distributed energy resources temporally and spatially. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response (DR); Electric vehicle retailer; Optimal power flow; Robust pricing; Transmission and distribution networks (TDNs); Unit commitment","Acoustic generators; Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Power markets; Sales; Vehicle transmissions; Demand response; Electric vehicle retailer; Optimal power flows; Optimization strategy; Response mechanisms; Robust pricing; Transmission and distribution; Transmission and distribution network; Unit Commitment; Costs; demand analysis; distribution system; electric vehicle; electricity industry; optimization; price dynamics","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52177204 ; and the Major Science and Technology Projects in Anhui Province under Grant 202003a05020019 .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179886122"

On the other hand, enhancing reactive power compensation in the power system gives rise to CVR implementation more effectively. This paper addresses how the power system planner could encourage investment to establish the above-mentioned topics. Here, a model for encouraging industrial loads to dynamically invest in implementing the CVR strategy over the planning horizon is presented. To make CVR implementation more efficient, investment in upgrading plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) chargers to be utilized as reactive power compensators is also considered. Industrial loads benefit from saving in their electricity bills and incentive payments that might be paid by utilities (if necessary). The objective function of the proposed planning model is to maximize the energy-saving of industrial loads and to minimize incentive payment by electric utilities over the planning horizon. This objective is achieved subject to that the investment plan is economically feasible. Moreover, power system operation constraints in the planning horizon based on AC power flow equations and voltage-dependent load models are considered. The proposed planning problem is modelled as a non-linear optimization problem that can be solved by off-the-shelf software, for example, GAMS. The proposed model is applied to the Ontario transmission system. The numerical results show the proposed model's effectiveness in designing an investment plan for industrial loads to implement the CVR strategy and upgrade PEVs’ chargers. © 2024 The Authors.

As a result, an Energy Management Controller (EMC) has been expanded for responding to DR signals and solving energy management problems. The EMC employs a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for automatically responding to the DR signal and solving energy management issues by planning 3 kinds of domestic load: non-interruptible, interruptible, and hybrid.

However, maximum penetration of RESs has always been challenging due to their intermittent nature. To address this challenge, this study advances a framework for the flexibility of the distribution network (DN) by employing transportable electrical storages (TESs) and transportable hydrogen storages (THSs). To do so, the TESs are considered to transfer electrical energy among high-penetrated and high-demand points. In addition, curtailed renewable power can be converted to green hydrogen and transferred to hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) using the THSs. To further flexibility, this work considers an incentive-based demand response (DR) program and vehicle-to-parking lot (V2PL) capable plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Moreover, a binary-based method is developed to carry out the trajectory planning of the TESs and THSs and the Floyd algorithm is exploited to minimize traveling and simulation time. Furthermore, the fuzzy information gap decision theory (IGDT) is proposed to enhance the scheduling robustness against the uncertainty of RESs. The obtained results corroborated the positive impact of the TESs and THSs by declining the operation cost by about 4.8 %. Moreover, the proposed uncertainty management model is quite robust against RESs’ uncertainty by achieving about 37.5 % less operation cost. © 2023","Hydrogen refueling station; Plug-in electric vehicle; Transportable electrical storage; Transportable hydrogen storage; Uncertainty","Decision theory; Electric power distribution; Operating costs; Plug-in electric vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Fuzzy information; Hydrogen refueling stations; Hydrogen storage system; Information-gap; Operations cost; Power; Renewable energy source; Transportable electrical storage; Transportable hydrogen storage; Uncertainty; Hydrogen storage; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy storage; fuzzy mathematics; hydrogen; optimization; uncertainty analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181876964"

The integration of new energy sources and electric vehicles has significantly altered grid loads, increasing the complexity of spatial load forecasting. However, existing techniques fail to fully consider the temporal and spatial correlation characteristics of data, leading to challenges in data identification and summarization. This reduces load forecasting accuracy and prolongs prediction time. To address these issues, a spatial electric load forecasting method based on improved scale limited dynamic time warping (LDTW) and graph convolutional network (GCN) are proposed. Firstly, the improved scale LDTW is used to improve the clustering effect of K-Mediods++, refine the type of load data, and make the subsequent model training more targeted. Secondly, the interconnections and distances of substations in a real network structure is used to build a graph model to capture the power load distribution. Finally, based on the clustering results and the graph model, GCN-LSTM is used to construct the spatio-temporal forecasting algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested using load data from a region in Shanghai and compared with other advanced algorithms.

This paper aimed to present a model from the ISO point of view for using demand-side resources as flexible resources that are aggregated as a demand-side provider (DSP). The DSP consists of demand response aggregator as grid backup and energy storage systems plus plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) parking lot aggregators as fast reserve. In this regard, a two-stage stochastic programming model has been presented for energy and reserve determination in the unit commitment problem in the form of mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In this study, the incentive-based model of the capacity market program has been employed to achieve a certain level of demand-side response. Meanwhile, the Weibull probability distribution function and truncated Gaussian distribution have been applied to generate wind speed scenarios and model the uncertainties of PEVs’ behavior, respectively. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the simultaneous scheduling of energy sources and demand-side aggregators for energy supply as well as reserve has led to the reduction of wind energy uncertainty and improved system operational conditions. Also, increase in the number of PEVs present in the parking lot, in addition to reducing the operation costs, leads to increased grid reserve level as well as considerable reduction of wind power spillage. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Capacity market program; Demand-side provider; Energy storage systems; Plug-in electric vehicles parking lot; Stochastic unit commitment; Wind power","Commerce; Distribution functions; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Integer programming; Plug-in electric vehicles; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Weibull distribution; Wind effects; Capacity market program; Capacity markets; Demand-side; Demand-side provider; Energy storage system; Parking lots; Plug-in electric vehicle parking lot; Stochastic unit commitments; Storage systems; Vehicle parking; Wind power","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168511173"

The proposed model is a bi-level optimization model formulated as an upper and lower-level problem. The problem of unit commitment in the transmission network as the upper level problem with the aim of reducing operating costs and load shedding as a mixed integer linear programming model and the problem of optimal operation in the distribution network by considering renewable and non-renewable resources along with electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS), it has been considered as a linear model with the aim of reducing the cost of purchasing power from the transmission network and increasing the use of renewable energy and charging power of EVCS. According to the literature, the study gap can be seen in three key points; firstly, it is of great importance to provide a convex model that can guarantee global optimal solutions. The next point is related to the problem-solving time, according to the dimensions and number of variables and parameters in the problem of optimal coordination of the transmission and distribution network, providing a method to achieve global optimal solutions in the shortest time and the last point is related to the modeling of any number of distribution networks is integrated with the transmission network. To solve the proposed bi-level optimization problem, the method of rewriting the optimization problems using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition equations, which can model global optimal solutions as well as fast solution time and modeling a large number of distribution networks in the transmission network has been proposed. Several different networks have been considered for the validation of the proposed model and method, which proves the results obtained from the simulation of the efficiency of the proposed model and method in considering the coordinated operation of transmission and smart distribution networks.

In this regard, electric vehicles (EVs) are a viable transportation option that benefit the environment in reducing GHG emissions. Although the installation of rapid charging stations (RCSs) helps to promote EVs, installing these at improper locations in the distribution network worsens the voltage profile, increases power loss, and energy loss while travelling from EV's current location to RCS. Furthermore, RCS installation cost and waiting time at RCS need to be considered. Therefore, a two-stage optimal planning is proposed in this article to address the issues stated above. In the first stage, simultaneous optimal planning of RCS and distributed generators is done to minimize active power loss, voltage deviation, EV user cost and to maximize voltage stability index. In the second stage, optimal number of connectors are decided to minimize the installation cost and waiting time in queue at RCS. Here, (Formula presented.) queuing model is considered to determine the waiting time.

First, a candidate EVCS planning scheme is obtained using queuing theory.

By then, coal and gas-fired power stations will have been largely replaced by wind and solar power, petrol and diesel cars will have been replaced by electric vehicles and smart grids and controllable loads will ensure that generation, storage and consumption are optimally coordinated. In short, in two decades’ time the energy system will be made up of very different systems and facilities and will use different forms of energy than today. © 2024, Bergbau-Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH.

For addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a Fuzzy Mathematical Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMMILP) approach for daily UC that incorporates the scheduling of Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) and Battery Energy Storage (BES) to manage supply and demand fluctuations. The FMMILP model explicitly considers these uncertainties and aims to minimize total production cost and carbon emissions while ensuring reliable and sustainable power system operation. The effective solution method for solving FMMILP is explained. The FMMILP model is applied to Thailand's national power system, characterized by its diverse generation mix, substantial RES penetration, and growing EV adoption. A comprehensive stochastic reliability analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation is performed, incorporating a wide range of supply and demand scenarios, including extreme worst-case scenarios, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models. These scenarios incorporate optimal solutions from UC and RES dispatch patterns. Three distinct FMMILP models are compared against a deterministic UC benchmark in the rainy, summer, and winter seasons. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the FMMILP model achieves optimal solutions within acceptable computational time and significantly enhances system reliability compared to the deterministic model, with reliability improvements of 15.99%, 26.14%, and 51.44% in the rainy season, summer season, and winter season, respectively.

This problem was inherently complex due to the involvement of numerous integer variables. Furthermore, the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources (RESs) like wind turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) has accelerated the transition to sustainable energy. However, widespread incorporation of such RESs into the power system grid has introduced substantial challenges, particularly related to increased operational uncertainties. In this study, the UC problem was constructed as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) using objective function derived from the total fuel costs of thermal generation units, linearized using a piece-wise method. The UC problem was further enhanced by incorporating a second life electric vehicle battery (SL-EVB) to mitigate the intermittency of RES outputs, thereby effectively reducing total fuel costs. The UC issue was implemented by employing a General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software under a CPLEX solver. To assess the efficacy of the proposed approach, the IEEE 118-bus system was employed. According to results of simulations, adding SL-EVB has the potential to reduce the total fuel costs of thermal generators by approximately 12% compared to the UC model without the integration of RESs and SL-EVB. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

With advancements in electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, where EVs act as distributed energy storage units, bidirectional energy exchange between vehicles and the grid can now contribute to LVDN operation. This paper proposes a low-voltage load distribution planning method that integrates street information and V2G technology.

For this purpose, a random simulation-based method is first developed to provide the tractable formulations of the adjustable charging load and reserve provision from EVs. This method avoids the unrealistic assumption that EVs drive and charge every day, which often exists in prior relevant approaches. Based on the random simulation, this paper proposes a novel GSEP optimization model which incorporates the weekly adjustable charging load of EVs. In the proposed model, the total charging load of EVs can be co-optimized with the investment and operational decisions of various generation and storage units. This GSEP model is applied to a provincial power system in south China. The numerical results show that the implementation of smart charging can significantly alter the decisions of GSEP. As the participation rate of smart charging improves from 0% to 90%, there is an additional 1,800 MW installation in wind and solar power, while the need to build new batteries is noticeably reduced; also, depending on the level of EV uptake, the annualized total system cost decreases by 5.11%–7.57%, and the curtailment of wind and solar power is reduced by 10.34%–19.64%. Besides, numerical tests reveal that the traditional assumption that EVs drive and charge every day can mislead the evaluation of adjustable charging load and overestimate the daily charging power peak by averagely 24.72%. © © 2024 You, Jin and Liu.","adjustable charging load; electric vehicles; generation and storage expansion planning; random simulation; smart charging","Charging stations; Adjustable charging load; Charging loads; Electric vehicle drive; Expansion planning; Generation and storage expansion planning; Large-scales; Power; Random simulation; Smart charging; South China; State of charge","Funding text 1: The authors declare that this study received funding from China Energy Engineering Group Guangdong Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd.

This study investigates the critical issue of optimizing the size and location of these stations, considering total costs, including investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, cost of power system loss, and power system reliability costs. To address this challenge, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a powerful optimization technique, is employed to identify the optimal sizes and locations of FCSs. The PSO enables the consideration of complex relationships among variables such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) demand, station capacity, and power system limitations. From the perspective of the Transmission System Operator (TSO), the impact of FCSs on power system reliability has been evaluated using an Energy Not Supplied (ENS) index to evaluate power system reliability costs. Simulation results on the 193-bus test system in northeastern Thailand, conducted with Power Factory DIgSILENT software, validate the effectiveness of our proposed model and method.

However, long-term uncertainties in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently, as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution networks expansion planning under multi-dimensional uncertainties.

To manage the increased computational complexities, a machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is implemented.

EV charging and discharging operations are effectively managed by creating both locally and globally optimal planning schemes. Future transportation could be changed by the widespread adoption of dynamic wireless power transfer systems in conjunction with EVs, as they would enable speedier travel and continuous EV battery recharging. Dynamic wireless power transfer is a practical answer to problems with electric vehicles. The electrification of automobiles will have a significant influence on the power infrastructure due to the increase in demand for electricity. In this study, we provide an optimal planning method worldwide and a locally optimal strategy for EV charging and discharging. To minimize the total cost of all EVs that charge and discharge during the day, we propose an optimization problem for global planning in which the charging powers are optimized. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed planning schemes can effectively reduce the total electricity cost for EV owners while also minimizing the impact on the power grid. The globally optimal planning scheme achieves the lowest electricity cost, while the locally optimal scheme provides a good balance between cost reduction and computational complexity. © © 2024 Boukhchana, Flah, Alkuhayli, Ullah and El-Bayeh.","charging and discharging smart grid; dynamic wireless charging; electric vehicle; inductive power transfer; optimal planning; state of charge (SOC); vehicle battery; vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Inductive power transmission; Vehicle-to-grid; Wireless charging; Charging and discharging smart grid; Dynamic wireless charging; Inductive powertransfer (IPT); Optimal planning; Smart grid; State of charge; States of charges; Vehicle battery; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204707325"

This study addresses these challenges by developing distributed energy management systems for the EVs and the ESSs, and sizing approaches for the PVs and the ESSs, by enabling multi-agent systems and fuzzy cognitive maps. The optimization framework simultaneously considers six key objective functions which studied separately or in limited combinations: (i) ESS installation cost, (ii) low-voltage network operation parameters, (iii) active power losses, (iv) EV charging times, (v) total energy costs, and (vi) excess energy from PV systems. Using environmental conditions and energy purchase costs to define two regions, Heraklion, Greece, and Berlin, Germany, under varying EV integration rates, the proposed methodology enables the IEEE European Low Voltage feeder as a case study and Euclidean distance is used to identify optimal solutions from the Pareto frontiers. Results show that the integration of the distributed ESS contributes to a significant reduction in network's energy consumption, while reduced solar irradiance in Berlin leads to different cost and operational patterns. Heraklion generally achieves better cost efficiency due to higher solar irradiance.

Electricity demand will increase sharply and there will be fluctuations in the networks. The only way to cope with this problem is to switch to smart networks. This article examines and economically analyses the method of switching from a vehicle to a network, which is considered to be used to solve the problem of fluctuations caused by the integration of renewable energy sources into the network. For this purpose, unlike other studies in the literature, a simulation study was conducted that took into account both the battery life of the car and the driver's behavior. The research to be done in smart networks and renewable energy sources should not be accepted only for home consumers. In terms of competitiveness, industrial consumers need to choose devices that support smart grids when developing and planning their systems. Researches on energy quality and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is very important in this regard.

Planning of DGs in distribution system is one of the potential solutions for improving existing distribution system performance without changing its infrastructure. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to determine the optimal way to allocate photovoltaic (PV) based distributed generators (DGs) inside radial distribution networks while taking into account the load demands of both conventional and PHEVs. In the study, three key technical metrics of the distribution network are improved via optimal planning of PV units: maximizing the voltage stability index, minimizing total voltage variation, and minimizing energy loss. Mathematically, weighted objective function is formulated for dealing the above-citied technical metrics. The weighted objective function is optimized using recently developed robust electric eel foraging optimization (EEFO) algorithm. The study first looks into how PHEV load demand affects the technical aspects of the distribution system. Subsequently, improvement of distribution system (accommodating both conventional and PHEVs load demand) performance via optimal planning PV units is discussed. IEEE-69 bus system is considered as a test system in this study. In addition, simulations utilising the differential evolution (DE) and grey wolf optimisation (GWO) methods are carried out in order to examine the robustness of the EEFO approach.

One countermeasure is autonomous load control, in which thermostatic loads and electric vehicle chargers quickly adjust the power consumption based on the grid frequency monitored by themselves without communication. However, testing the impact of such load controls on the frequency in actual power systems is too expensive. Therefore, a laboratory-scale isolated power system was prepared as a test bed to examine autonomous load control based on the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and the frequency deviation to cope with steep frequency fluctuations. Moreover, the experimental system was simulated numerically using MATLAB/Simulink. The experimental and simulation results are comparable, indicating that the simulation can be used to determine the total capacity and threshold when planning the introduction of autonomous control loads. The experimental and simulation results also show that frequency fluctuations can be mitigated by introducing autonomous control loads to the grid, and the response time can be improved by approximately 1 s by controlling the load based on the RoCoF. © 2013 IEEE.","Autonomous load control; demand response; frequency regulation; inertia; rate of change of frequency (RoCoF)","Electric frequency control; Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electric power utilization; MATLAB; Power control; Vehicle-to-grid; Autonomous load control; Demand response; Frequency control; Frequency measurements; Frequency regulations; Generator; Inertia; Load flow control; Power; Power demands; Power system; Rate of change of frequencies; Rate of change of frequency; Time-frequency Analysis; Wind power","This work was partially funded by the JSPS KAKENHI (grant number: JP23H01640).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200233462"

However, high initial costs and a lack of infrastructure, power storage, and power quality (PQ) are potential concerns for RESs and EVs in power systems. Among the numerous power quality (PQ) devices, the unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) can compensate for voltage and current-related PQ difficulties, correct the power factor, and is well suited for coordinative operation and control with RESs uncertainty. The position, size, and dynamic VAr control of UPQC, on the other hand, are key influencing variables for enhancing the performance and PQ of electrical distribution systems (EDSs). This paper describes an upgraded UPQC configuration known as open-UPQC (UPQC-O) for reducing PQ difficulties caused by the inclusion of PVs and EVs. Further, an efficient gazelle optimization algorithm (GOA) is suggested to solve the multi-objective optimal allocation of the PV-UPQC-O issue with an emphasis on voltage quality, distribution losses, and voltage stability. Simulations were performed for various scenarios using a modified IEEE 33-bus test system. According to the comparison data, the PV-UPQC-O improved the feeder performance more effectively than the standard UPQC and UPQC-O. The proposed PV-UPQC-O results for total loss reduction of 76.15% when compared to base case without EV load penetration. On the other hand, it is around 76.52% reduction when compared to base case with EV load penetration. Furthermore, the proposed GOA outperforms the prairie dog optimization (PDO), pelican optimization algorithm (POA) and coati optimization algorithm (COA) in terms of global solution and convergence. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

While these sources have accompanied in a gathering of advantages, such as cost-effective operation of wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) installations and the mitigation of environmental hazards linked with traditional power sources, they have also introduced a host of challenges to planning and operation of power systems. Also, Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) stand out as a highly promising technology for reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector, aligning with the global Net-zero target. The standard optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which is naturally nonlinear, has become even more complex with the addition of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles along with traditional thermal power generators. This increased complexity comes from the unpredictable and intermittent nature of these new resources. Monte Carlo techniques are used to estimate the production costs of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and analyze their viability. The uncertainty of the renewable sources and PEVs is modeled using Weibull, lognormal, and normal probability distribution functions (PDFs). The comprehensive OPF, incorporating renewable energy components and PEVs, is cast as a single objective problem encompassing various objectives, such as decreasing fuel costs, total emissions, voltage deviations, and real transmission losses. This research shares a common objective by introducing a novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm (MRGTO) to address the OPF challenge. Additionally, the study explores the impact of renewable energy resources and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) on the stochastic OPF problem. The MRGTO employs artificial gorilla troops optimizer (GTO) with manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm to achieve the optimal results for the OPF problem with stochastic RES and V2G. The developed technique is expected to increase the solution accuracy through increasing the solution diversity through an optimization procedure. Initial assessments are executed on benchmark functions. After that, a combined model of wind and PV-integrated IEEE 30-bus system are executed by the proposed MRGTO algorithm and other well-known optimization algorithms. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using the IEEE 30-bus test system under different scenarios. The evaluations have shown the proposed MRGTO technique to be superior at attainment a best solution for the OPF problem considering stochastic wind and PV power and V2G. Moreover, the obtained solutions confirmed the MRGTO technique would be more effective in optimization with quicker convergence rate, and higher convergence precision. After testing, the effectiveness of the MRGTO algorithm has been found to be much robust than the conventional artificial gorilla troops optimizer, manta ray foraging optimization, and other well-known published heuristics, metaheuristics, and hybrid optimization techniques.INDEX TERMS Optimal power flow, plug-in electric vehicle, renewable energy sources, V2G, artificial gorilla troops optimizer, manta ray foraging optimization. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial gorilla troops optimizer; manta ray foraging optimization; Optimal power flow; plug-in electric vehicle; renewable energy sources; V2G","Acoustic generators; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Distribution functions; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Monte Carlo methods; Plug-in electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Renewable energy; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Weibull distribution; Artificial gorilla troop optimizer; Manta ray foraging optimization; Metaheuristic; Optimal power flows; Optimisations; Optimizers; Power system dynamics; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty; Vehicle to grids; Optimization","Acknowledgement: This project is sponsored by Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University (PSAU) as part of funding for its SDG Roadmap Research Funding Program project number PSAU-2023-SDG-16.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198270838"

An environmentally friendly EVCS model and a novel metaheuristic optimization technique, the Giza Pyramids Construction Algorithm (GPCA) is employed, to determine the optimal sizing of system components. The objective is to ensure dependability, as determined by the lack of power supply probability (LPSP), while minimizing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and total net present cost (TNPC). We assess the efficacy of other algorithms in scaling system components by contrasting the performance of the GPCA with those of the Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA), Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The study also examines the impact of climatic, financial, and technical factors on system costs, providing insights into the challenges, opportunities, and socio-economic factors influencing the deployment of EV infrastructure in KSA. Findings suggest that the optimal EVCS configuration is a solar photovoltaic/wind turbine (SPV/WT) grid-tied system, resulting in an LCOE of\ 0.0796/kWh, a TNPC of\ 102,042, and an annual CO2 emission reduction of 18,840 kg. The system achieves a 67.9% renewable penetration rate with 30.8% annual grid electricity purchase and 32.4% sale. Sensitivity analysis on renewable parameters is also conducted, demand charges, grid purchase prices, discount rates, and inflation rates to assess their impact on the system's economic variables.

However, in existing studies, charging scheduling is divided into a power system perspective focusing on grid stability and a transportation perspective focusing on the optimal operation of EVs. As EVs affect both systems, it is necessary to consider both grid operation and transportation-network operation simultaneously. In this study, an integrated operation algorithm for the transportation network and power grid has been developed, which determines the amount of demand response through the power-flow results at the upper level and resolves traffic congestion by setting the optimal route for EVs at the lower level. The Demand Response (DR) adjustment amount is determined based on MATSim vehicle data, rather than simply looking at the DR amount from the perspective of the power system. Furthermore, the concept of Autonomous Integrated EVs (AIEV) in the integrated system has been constructed, which improves the grid stability to cope with uncooperative EVs. The transportation system is configured using MATSim to run the integrated simulation, and the power system is configured using the IEEE-33 bus model. The integrated operating algorithm received high evaluation indicators for voltage stability, power loss, and average driving time.

For high-voltage low-current drives of EVs with high-boosting/bucking gain, single-stage single-arm DC/DC converters suffer from unstable output voltage and the impractical choice of charging/discharging elements. Therefore, a multi-stage multi-arm DC/DC converter is researched to solve the problems of high boosting/bucking gain and minimized the voltage and current ripples. This paper presents parametric sizing, dynamic modeling, and analysis of all logical operational modes for a new high-gain DC/DC converter suitable for deployment in EV applications. The proposed topology composes of three-stage interleaved-input composed of cascaded two stages and double float-output as a third stage with bidirectional current capability. In this study, parametric design, and sizing for the three stages are performed according to the prerequisite ratings. Then, an analysis is conducted on rules of operating the DC/DC converter along with a discussion on considerations taken into account for such a critical design. An investigation of the dynamic behavior of the suggested DC/DC converter is carried out through a state-space model with switches' states. Furthermore, a simulation and measurement-based validation of the derived mathematical models are conducted. The theoretical based analysis, design, and boosting gains are confirmed through a constructed and tested prototype given data on power supply and load utilization.

To address this issue, this paper introduces the Combined Model of Road Transport and Electric Distribution Network (CoRTED), a framework for strategically deploying EV charging stations considering the dynamics of both networks. The CoRTED model minimizes EV user travel costs, power loss, and voltage deviation. The model employs a bi-level optimization approach with PSO-DS algorithm for station deployment and combined convex optimization (CCO) for traffic network equilibrium. Grid economic operation is formulated as AC OPF and solved using a primal-dual interior point method. Validation is performed using a modified Nguyen-Dupius RTN and IEEE 33 bus EDN, demonstrating CoRTED's effectiveness in integrated network planning for EV infrastructure. Due to the increase in power demand by EVs, the loss and voltage deviation are increased to 4.679 MW and 24.23%, respectively. The proposed model reduces the losses and voltage deviation by 4.487 MW and 1.24%.

However, the complexity that arises from the inherent instability and uncertainty associated with these measures affects power grids and significantly complicates the Unit Commitment Problem (UCP). This research paper introduces two unique optimization techniques which are the Main Arithmetic Approach (AOT) and the Modified Arithmetic Approach (IAOT) to address the optimal decisions for the UCP considering intermittent RENs and LDVs. The AOT exploits the statistical characteristics inherent in basic mathematical operators. Additionally, AOT leverages the probability distributions associated with fundamental mathematical operators to optimize its operations. Conversely, the proposed IAOT boosts effectiveness by harnessing the benefits of natural logarithms and exponential operators with high-density values for operator selection to produce a more flexible search process. Moreover, the IAOT takes advantage of the unique properties of natural logarithms and exponential operators with high-density values to achieve improved performance. Real power system data is utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis involving four distinct UCP case studies with twelve relevant scenarios ranging from SA1 to SF2 showing the low and prominent levels of penetration of LDVs in different seasonal conditions that incorporate uncertainties of RENs. The effectiveness of the elected approaches is examined through key performance indicators including the overall operating costs per day (OCD) and the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), considering distinct LDVs profiles and levels of RENs penetration. The study shows significant insights into the scenarios analyzed. Scenario SF1 - IAOT is the most cost-effective alternative, with OCD of 528,430, closely followed by SB1 - IAOT, which costs 529,550. Conversely, Scenario SD2 - AOT has the greatest OCD of 559,667. Furthermore, the CER and OCD offer useful insights. SB1 - IAOT has the lowest OCD (20.69), whereas SD2 - AOT has the greatest OCD (21.92). In terms of CER, Scenario SE1 - AOT has the greatest value of 0.91, whereas SB1 - IAOT, SA1 - AOT, SC1 - IAOT, and SF2 - IAOT have the lowest CER of 0.86., highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating RENs and LDVs in achieving favorable financial implications for grid operators and decision-makers. The comprehensive analysis results demonstrate the elected techniques' applicability and superiority in finding the best optimal solutions to the UCP incorporating different RENs and LDVs scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.","arithmetic approaches; electric light duty vehicles (LDVs); Intermittent renewable energies; Monte Carlo simulation; power system operation","Cost effectiveness; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Mathematical operators; Monte Carlo methods; Operating costs; Probability distributions; Uncertainty analysis; Arithmetic approach; Convergence; Electric light duty vehicle; Intermittent renewable energy; Light duty vehicles; Monte Carlo's simulation; Optimisations; Power; Power system; Power system operations; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty; Renewable energy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194036671"

This increasing EV penetration is anticipated to result in a growing electricity demand to address the EV charging requirements. Therefore, precise demand modeling is essential to enable optimal sizing of the electricity generation and distribution networks as well as optimal placement of the EV charging infrastructure. Furthermore, microscopic modeling of EV traffic patterns and trip-wise energy requirements is essential to enable effective charging coordination and demand distribution for on-the-move EVs. However, microscopic EV demand modeling is typically hindered by the scarcity of open-access data that integrates EV charging and driving patterns. Accordingly, this work proposes a methodology for microscopic modeling of the trip-wise electricity demand of mobile EVs in the spatial and temporal domains, using both multiple linear regression and spatial autoregressive models. Secondary open-access data is extracted, wrangled, and pre-processed from a number of data sources to test and validate the proposed methodology on a case study of Dubai - UAE, acknowledging the growing EV adoption rates in the city.

To address these environmental challenges, the electrification of transportation systems through Electric Vehicles (EVs) has emerged as a promising solution. However, the successful deployment of EVs hinges on the availability of a robust charging infrastructure capable of meeting the charging demands and extending the driving range of EVs. Nonetheless, the large-scale deployment of EV charging infrastructure presents several challenges, including the ability of the electric grid to supply the required energy to accommodate the charging demand. Moreover, determining the optimal locations for fast-charging stations (FCS) in the traffic network to ensure accessibility, convenience, and efficient resource utilization poses a significant challenge. As a result, numerous studies have investigated the optimal allocation and sizing of EV charging infrastructure. The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive literature review to examine how this optimization problem has been addressed in the literature over the past decade. The review aims to identify the key factors considered in the problem formulation and the optimization techniques for allocating and sizing the charging stations. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA methodology for a comprehensive and unbiased approach. This review contributes to the existing literature by highlighting critical gaps and proposing a framework that can possibly bridge these gaps. The review identifies several critical gaps in current research, including: 1) Transportation-focused studies largely ignore electrical grid constraints; 2) Electrical-focused research often relies on statistically modeled EV charging demand, which may include some geographical assumptions; 3) Multidisciplinary approaches integrating both transportation and electrical networks are still in early stage; 4) Dynamic traffic flow of EVs is rarely considered; 5) Exact optimization methods largely rely on linearized or approximated models; 6) Dominance of approximate methods in transportation and electrical network modeling, primarily relying on evolutionary algorithms; and 7) Hybrid approaches are mainly utilized to solve a specific part of the problem rather than enhancing the quality of the solution. In response to these gaps, the research proposes a novel framework to integrate the transportation network and the electrical grid planning process, offering a holistic and practical solution in FCS infrastructure development. © 2013 IEEE.","Allocation; fast charging station; optimization; power flow; transportation electrification","Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Electric load flow; Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Electric utilities; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Optimization; Power quality; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-grid; Allocation; Electric vehicle charging; Electrification; Fast charging stations; Load flow; Optimisations; Power flows; Resource management; Systematic; Transportation electrifications; Electric vehicles","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189165732"

In recent years, research has focused on how to address the issue of large-scale charging and discharging of EVs while ensuring the grid's security. Distribution network operators should choose places where EV charging is practicable in terms of environmental and financial benefits. To establish how to best charge and discharge EVs in the distribution network, first comprehend and then determine the optimal position of EV parking lots in the distribution network. In this article, to solve this optimization problem, first the mathematical model of the problem is built, and then-according to the nonlinear features of the proposed optimization model-the second-order cone method is used to find the optimal solution with high accuracy and speed. The objective functions can accomplish more realistic objectives like lowering losses and minimizing voltage deviation changes with the charging and discharging time control technique, in addition to optimizing the technical requirements of the distribution network. The two-point estimation method of Hang is used to describe the uncertainty in the loads and capacities of solar sources in the random state, and optimization is applied to the IEEE 33-bus distribution system. The obtained results reveal that the proposed method not only meets the charging and discharging requirements of large-scale EVs, but also ensures the stability of the power grid, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in the optimal planning of EVs. © 2024, Tafila Technical University.

As of July 2023, India’s power system has seen a rapid transformation, with renewable energy, including large hydro, accounting for 40% of the total installed capacity at 177 GW. The ongoing energy transition has not only changed the country’s energy mix but also brought new challenges for system operators. The primary challenge is frequency instability due to the reduction of system inertia and governor-based primary frequency response (PFR) availability by large-scale integration of uncertain renewable energy resources (RES) such as wind and solar photovoltaic generators. Furthermore, the absence of frequency control ancillary services market, inadequate penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and uncertainty of RES generation enhance the complexity of the frequency response services in the Indian power system. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the frequency response challenges of the future low-carbon Indian power system and underlines the new potential fast frequency response (FFR) services from advanced energy storage and renewable generation technologies. Such FFR services can be swiftly deployed in low-inertia grids through the integration of energy storage systems and inverter-based resources in a shorter span. Modeling of FFR services in security constraint unit commitment (SCUC) can enhance grid resiliency and facilitate high penetration of RES in the Indian power system without loss of frequency stability. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","frequency response; frequency stability; Indian power system; renewable energy sources; system inertia","Carbon; Electric frequency control; Electric power system control; Electric power system stability; Energy storage; Frequency stability; Hydroelectric power plants; Renewable energy; Solar power generation; Energy; Energy transitions; Indian power systems; Installed capacity; Low carbon; Power; Rapid transformations; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; System inertia; Frequency response","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188610632"

This article addresses the placement and scheduling of EVCS and BSS within a radial distribution network (RDN) overlaid with a road network. Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) and Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP) is introduced to reduce EV energy consumption during trips to EVCS and BSS. A Bi-layer optimization approach is used, with the outer layer minimizing energy loss by allocating EVCS and BSS optimally, and the inner layer optimizing scheduling considering associated costs. Uncertainties related to EV is considered on a real-time trip basis and modelled using 2m-Point estimation method. The problem is solved using Differential Evolution (DE) and Prairie Dog Optimization (PDO) techniques.

To predict and optimize the energy consumption of electric vehicles, this study predicts energy consumption based on the energy consumption characteristics of the electric vehicle power system and air conditioning system, and combines path optimization algorithms for energy-saving path planning. The study first improves the recursive least squares algorithm by combining the forgetting factor, and constructs a vehicle energy consumption identification model based on the improved recursive least squares algorithm and neural network. Then, a path optimization model based on improved seagull optimization is established using chaotic mapping strategy and t-distribution to improve the seagull optimization algorithm. The results showed that the predicted final energy consumption of the model constructed in the study was 2.81kW.h, with an error rate of 5.1%. The improved seagull optimization algorithm obtained an optimal solution of 30.88m for burma14 and 423.74m for oliver30, which were consistent with the published optimal solutions. When the air conditioning was turned on, the energy consumption of the path selected by the algorithm was reduced by about 5.6%. Under the condition of not turning on the air conditioning, the energy consumption of the path selected by the algorithm was reduced by about 4.98%. In summary, the model constructed through research has good application effects in predicting and optimizing vehicle energy consumption.

However, range anxiety and charging downtime are some challenges slowing down the adoption of this new technology. Dynamic wireless charging (DWC) aims to minimize the problems above by allowing the EVs to charge while in motion. With DWC, optimizing the locations of the lanes is crucial to maximizing their utilization while minimizing the capital and operational expenditure of the system. Additionally, the extra load that DWC incurs on the power grid must be considered to avoid grid overload. In this work, a realistic traffic simulation is built.

Due to their rapid response, batteries are attractive for providing ancillary services (AS), such as frequency regulation and reserve services, to the bulk power grid. On the other hand, an electric vehicle (EV) is viewed as a moving battery; consequently, EVs are also suitable for those services. This research proposes a linear planning model for an Electric Vehicle Aggregator (EVA) within a distribution network (DN) to offer Ancillary Services (AS) to the bulk power grid. The model takes into account contract design by identifying optimal incentives or charging tariffs that Electric Vehicle (EV) owners would be willing to pay the EVA for charging their vehicles. Additionally, the model takes into account the size of the electric vehicle (EV) fleet as a crucial planning factor for EV aggregation that depends on the energy pricing set by the EVA. The proposed model is developed to maximize the overall profit of bidding capacities in the energy and AS markets while supporting the operation of an unbalanced DN by maintaining the DN limits. Simulation results and sensitivity analyses on the model have been carried out to support the investment model and investigate the change in the optimal solution across different case studies. Simulations show that the optimal charging tariff (beta ) is (0.02~{}/kWh )when considering scenarios where Distribution Network (DN) limits, such as thermal and voltage constraints, are ignored for all EV participation versus beta relations. When including the DN, the optimal payoffs vary based on the relationship between the charging tariff and the number of participating EVs. © 2013 IEEE.","ancillary services; electricity market; EV aggregators,V2G; G2V; planning model; unbalanced distribution network","Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Investments; Power markets; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Ancillary service; Battery; Contract design; Electric vehicle aggregator; Frequency control; G2V; Planning models; Tariff; Unbalanced distribution networks; Vehicle to grids; Electric power distribution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186104366"

Conventional power flow (PF) approaches such as forward-backward sweep (FBS) and Newton-Raphson require a high number of iterations to solve non-linear PF equations making them computationally very intensive. PF is the most important study performed by utility, required in all stages of the power system, especially in operations and planning. This paper discusses the applications of deep learning (DL) to predict PF solutions for three-phase unbalanced power distribution grids. Three deep neural networks (DNNs); Radial Basis Function Network (RBFnet), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are proposed in this paper to predict PF solutions. The strength of the proposed DNN models over the traditional iterative-based PF solvers is that these models can capture the nonlinear relationships in PF calculations to accurately predict the solutions. The PF problem is formulated as a multi-output regression model where two or more output values are predicted based on the inputs. The training and testing data are generated through the OpenDSS-MATLAB COM interface. These methods are completely data-driven where the training relies on reducing the mismatch at each node without the need for the knowledge of the system. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that the models can accurately predict the PF solutions for the unbalanced distribution grids with mutual coupling and are robust to different R/X ratios, topology changes as well as generation and load variability introduced by the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs). To test the efficacy of the DNN models, they are applied to IEEE 4-node and 123-node test cases, and the American Electric Power (AEP) feeder model. The PF results for RBFnet, MLP, and CNN models are discussed in this paper which demonstrate that all three DNN models provide highly accurate results in predicting PF solutions. © 2013 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; deep neural networks; multi-layer perceptron; Power flow analysis; radial basis function networks; unbalanced power distribution grids","Convolution; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Energy resources; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural network models; Probability distributions; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Topology; Convolutional neural network; Load flow; Load modeling; Multilayers perceptrons; Power; Power distribution grids; Power distributions; Power flow analyze; Power system; Predictive models; Unbalanced power distribution grid; Deep neural networks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186103980"

Public charging station (PCS) placement and size must be determined to enable efficient and sustainable charging services. This work proposes a novel method for optimal design and allocation of hybrid photovoltaic systems (HPVs) and PCSs in reconfigurable feeders. A novel LFHBA combines the strengths of the levy flight (LF) exploration technique and the honey badger algorithm (HBA) to solve the multi-objective function focused on distribution loss reduction, improve voltage profiles, and improve reliability index. To test the suggested technique, modified IEEE 69-bus distribution feeders are simulated with varied EV load penetrations. LFHBA is compared to basic HBA, butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), pelican optimization algorithm (POA), pathfinder algorithm (PFA) in computing performance. The comparison analysis shows that LFHBA has lower target values and greater convergence. Reconfigurable feeder topology permits distribution network design changes, improving system dependability and minimizing power losses. In comparison to base case, EV penetration causes to raise the losses by 26.65%, by optimal allocation of PCSs alone causes to reduce the losses by 38.82%, optimal allocation of PVs and ONR causes reduce losses by 92.19%, whereas, simultaneous allocation of PCSs, and HPVs results to reduce losses by 96.47%. This study emphasizes the need of optimizing PCS placement and capacity with HPVs for efficient and sustainable charging services. As shown by its greater performance over other optimization methods, the LFHBA algorithm helps achieve these goals.

In emphasizing the calculation of vehicle charging and hydrogen refueling demands, the proposed approach employs the Voronoi diagram and the particle swarm algorithm. Initially, Origin–Destination (OD) pairs represent car starting and endpoints, portraying travel demands. Utilizing the traffic network model, Dijkstra’s algorithm determines the shortest path for new energy vehicles, with the Monte Carlo simulation obtaining electric hydrogen energy demands. Subsequently, the Voronoi diagram categorizes the service scope of EHCIS, determining the equipment capacity while considering charging and refueling capabilities. Furthermore, the Voronoi diagram is employed to delineate the EHCIS service scope, determine the equipment capacity, and consider distance constraints, enhancing the rationality of site and service scope divisions. Finally, a dynamic optimal current model framework based on second-order cone relaxation is established for distribution networks. This framework plans each element of the active distribution network, ensuring safe and stable operation upon connection to EHCIS. To minimize the total social cost of EHCIS and address the constraints related to charging equipment and hydrogen production, a siting and capacity model is developed and solved using a particle swarm algorithm. Simulation planning in Sioux Falls city and the IEEE33 network validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, ensuring stable power grid operation while meeting automotive energy demands. © 2024 by the authors.","electric hydrogen charging integrated station; electric vehicles; hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; site selection and fixed capacity; Voronoi diagram","Charging (batteries); Computational geometry; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Graphic methods; Hydrogen production; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Electric hydrogen charging integrated station; Energy demands; Equipment capacities; Hydrogen charging; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Hydrogen refueling; Particle swarm algorithm; Service scope; Site selection and fixed capacity; Voronoi diagrams; Site selection","This work is funded by the Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China (No.5400-202228170A-1-1-ZN).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183838276"

The scope of this work is to create a prototype and show a different approach to assessing the number of inlets required on highways. The proposed method estimates the energy requirements for the future electric fleet on highways. It is based on an energy conversion that starts with the fuel sold in the highway network and ends with the number of charging inlets. A proposed benchmark method estimates energy requirements for the electric fleet using consolidated values and statistics about refueling attitudes, with factors for range correction and winter conditions. The results depend on assumptions about future car distribution, with varying numbers of required inlets. The analysis revealed that vehicle traffic is a critical factor in determining the number of required charging inlets, with significant variance between different SAs. This study highlights the necessity of incorporating factors like weather, car charging power, and the future EV range into these estimations. The findings are useful for planning EV charging infrastructure, especially along major traffic routes and in urban areas with high-range vehicles relying on High-Power DC (HPDC) charging. The model’s applicability to urban scenarios can be improved by considering the proportion of energy recharged at the destination. A key limitation is the lack of detailed origin–destination (OD) highway data, leading to some uncertainty in the calculated range ratio coefficient and underscoring the need for future research to refine this model. © 2024 by the authors.","charging infrastructure; charging stations; distribution network; electric vehicles; energy policy; mobility; sustainable mobility; sustainable transport; transport decarbonization; transport management; transportation planning","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183358059"

Scene generation is an effective method to solve the uncertainty problem of stochastic planning of integrated systems of new energy generation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scenario generation and scenario reduction model of photovoltaic (PV) output and electric vehicle (EV) load power under extreme weather based on the copula function. Firstly, the non-parametric kernel density estimation method is used to fit a large number of sample data. The kernel density estimation expressions of PV and EV powers under extreme weather conditions are obtained and the corresponding goodness of fit tests are carried out. Then, a variety of joint distribution models based on the copula function are established to judge the goodness of fit of each model, and the optimal copula function is selected as the joint probability distribution function by combining the Kendall and Spearman correlation coefficients of each model. Finally, the optimal copula joint probability distribution is used to generate PV and EV power scenarios. The data of extremely hot weather in a certain province were selected for an example analysis. The results show that the output scenario obtained conforms to the correlation under this extreme weather, and has higher accuracy in reflecting the actual PV output and load power in this province under this extreme weather, which can provide a reference for reliability analyses of power systems and power grid planning. © 2024 by the authors.","copula function; high-temperature weather; K-means clustering method; kernel density estimation method; scenario generation; scenario reduction","Distribution functions; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Global warming; K-means clustering; Statistics; Stochastic systems; Copula functions; Extreme weather; High-temperature weather; Highest temperature; K-means clustering method; Kernel Density Estimation methods; Load power; Photovoltaics; Scenario reductions; Scenarios generation; Electric loads","This research is supported by the Science and Technology Project of SGCC “Research on Quantitative Assessment and Defense Technology of Power Supply Risk of Renewable Energy Power System for Extreme Scenarios” (5100-202255338A-2-0-SY).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183158170"

Minimizing the overall operational cost of integrated power systems while dealing with wind energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles in integrated power systems using a chaotic zebra optimization algorithm (CZOA) is described. The proposed system deals with a probabilistic forecasting system for wind power generation and a realistic plug-in electric vehicle charging profile based on travel patterns and infrastructure characteristics. The objective is to identify the optimal scheduling and committed status of the generating unit for thermal and wind power generation while considering the system power demand, charging, and discharging of electric vehicles, as well as power available from wind energy sources. The proposed CZOA adeptly tackles the intricacies of the unit commitment problem by seamlessly integrating scheduling and the unit’s committed status, thereby enabling highly effective optimization. The proposed algorithm is tested for 10-, 20-, and 40-generating unit systems. The empirical findings pertaining to the 10-unit system indicate that the amalgamation of a thermal generating unit system with plug-in electric vehicles yields a 0.84% reduction in total generation cost. Furthermore, integrating the same system with a wind energy source results in a substantial 12.71% cost saving. Notably, the integration of the thermal generating system with both plug-in electric vehicles and a wind energy source leads to an even more pronounced overall cost reduction of 13.05%.

However, the intermittent and unpredictable behaviour of renewable energy sources poses new challenges for the planning and operation of power systems. To overcome these issues, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges and improve power systems. This research focuses on improving the performance of the V2G system by implementing an intelligent fuzzy logic-based charge and discharge management system for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The system uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to ensure accurate and stable energy extraction from the photovoltaic system, even under varying irradiation conditions. Indeed, the fuzzy logic controller, in combination with the Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV)/CC (Constant Current) strategy, ensures the charging and discharging of the electric vehicle batteries according to specific pre-defined conditions. The system is connected to the grid using a three-phase inverter controlled by the voltage source control strategy. The efficiency of the proposed system is supported by detailed simulation results which demonstrate maximum power extraction without oscillation or overshoot, as well as remarkable stability and resistance to gradual or abrupt changes in irradiance and load variations. The fuzzy system facilitates intelligent management, allowing EVs to actively participate in energy balancing activities, ensuring load continuity and enabling charging of other vehicles.

Plenty of batteries are managed by the battery swapping and charging stations (BSCSs) as the core assets.

This paper addresses two critical aspects of BSCS batteries: the optimal amount of inventory batteries and the tradeoff between the initial number of depleted and fully-charged batteries at the beginning of each scheduling horizon. Aiming at these, the time coupling between initial inventory, charging/discharging strategy, and swapping time sequence is analyzed.

These techniques involve multiple agents that respond to a dynamic simulation environment to strategically integrate EV charging stations (EVCSs) on microgrids by incorporating the constraints posed by stochastic trip durations. In addition, recent research works have demonstrated that planning frameworks based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) techniques are suitable for the efficient functioning of microgrids comprising renewable energy sources (RESs) and battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Even though MADRL techniques have been used to solve the optimum EV charging scheduling challenges and MOO frameworks have been developed to determine the optimal RES-BESS allocation, the potential of merging MADRL and MOO is yet to be explored. Therefore, this research provides an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of combined MOO-MADRL dynamics and their computational efficacy. In this context, this work presents a novel Multi-objective Artificial Vultures Optimization Algorithm based on Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MOAVOA-MADDPG) planning framework for allocating RESs, BESSs, and EVCSs on microgrids. The objective function is formulated to optimize the network power losses, total installation and operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and system voltage stability. Moreover, the proposed framework incorporates the sporadic nature of RES systems and intends to improve the state of charge (SOC) of the EVs present in the network.

Therefore, proper planning and development of charging infrastructure are essential to promote EVs. This paper proposes a multi-objective formulation to determine fast charging stations' optimal placement and sizing on intra-city corridors in a coupled transportation and Electrical Power Distribution Network (EPDN). The proposed formulation does a distance-based mapping between all transportation and EPDN nodes for precisely observing the impact of EV charging on EPDN. The proposed planning simultaneously considers the objectives and constraints of the transportation network and EPDN while satisfying the EV charging requirements. The EV charging demand, utilized in planning, is predicted using the Random Forest technique while considering the day type, hourly weather, and traffic flow that affect the forecasting accuracy. The improved Particle Swarm Optimization with Constriction Factor solves the proposed formulation for a 30-node EPDN coupled with a 25-node transportation network. The analysis of various cases, including varying initial State-Of-Charge of EVs and percentage growth of EVs per year, proves the efficacy and robustness of the proposed work. Note to Practitioners-The planned deployment of charging infrastructure is critical to facilitate EVs' adoption and sustainable growth of EV industries. Since, EV charging stations couple transportation network and EPDN, the planning strategy should consider requirements of both networks. For satisfactory driving experience of EV users, the planning should also consider driving range constraints and charging requirements of EV users. Several works on charging infrastructure planning have been carried out. However, several aspects relevant to EV users, transportation networks, EPDN, and determining EV charging demand have been overlooked in existing literature (as evidenced through Table I). These aspects must be considered simultaneously while planning charging stations. Hence, this work proposes a planning strategy for optimal placement and sizing of fast EV charging stations in a metropolitan city connecting multiple suburbs while considering several aspects of transportation networks and EPDNs. The proposed strategy can be utilized by utilities for efficient deployment of charging infrastructure on metropolitan city intra-city corridors. It establishes a distance-based mapping between all transportation and EPDN nodes for observing the impact of EV charging on EPDN. The determination of EV charging demand is a crucial step in the planning, which is determined by forecasting hourly traffic flow while considering several key attributes. The proposed approach achieves the EPDN objectives of reducing power loss, voltage deviation, and total charging stations' establishment cost, and transportation network objectives of maximising captured traffic flow while satisfying driving range constraints and charging requirements of EVs. Therefore, the focus is to utilize the existing grid infrastructure optimally while achieving the objectives and satisfying constraints of EV users, transportation network, and EPDN. Relevant case studies demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of proposed approach. The uncertainties in EVs' injections and arrival/departure times will be considered in our future work. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Charging station; electric vehicle; electrical power distribution network; placement; sizing; smart grid; transportation system","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric conductivity; Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Energy security; Global warming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Secondary batteries; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electrical power; Electrical power distribution network; Placement; Power distribution network; Sizing; Smart grid; Transportation system; Urban areas; Electric vehicles","This work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology and Indo U.S. Science and Technology Forum, New Delhi, India, under an Indo U.S. Collaborative Project US-India Collaborative for Smart DiStribution System With Storage (UI-ASSIST) with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, under Project IUSSTF/EE/2017282B.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165388642"

These power systems are responsible for increased power quality issues, exacerbating control problems. Frequency changes and power quality issues are the central concerns caused by these modern power systems. Frequency deviations occur mainly due to variations in generation, consumption, or both, and one of the critical reasons is the low inertia of the modern renewable penetrated hybrid power systems. So, to handle all these issues related to frequency and many more, the need for the best controller arises, which can easily handle any nonlinearities. This article comprehensively analyzes various load frequency control (LFC) architectures in various power system configurations. It focuses on the frequency management features of various power systems, including microgrids that use renewable energy and electric vehicles, with a complete understanding of current development states. Different controllers and tactics underwent comparative investigations. The detailed tabular analysis of frequency control architectures provides a deep insight into the LFC assessment of various power system configurations.

However, existing planning models for HRSs tend to focus on the interior of the city, the research on the planning of HRSs in highway networks, as well as the optimal allocation of hydrogen that can exist between HRSs is usually ignored. This article proposed a collaborative planning method for HRSs in highway networks that included photovoltaic (PV) and hydrogen allocation. First, based on the Floyd algorithm and the Monte Carlo algorithm, this article proposed a charging demand simulation method for HRSs in highway networks. Then we proposed an HRSs energy allocation method using hydrogen as backup mobile energy which aims to realize the cross-space energy dispatch of multi-site PV power generation and improve the energy supply reliability of the HRSs. Finally, based on the above research, considering the safety constraints of the power system along the highway network and the installed capacity constraints of the PV power generation system, we proposed an HRSs planning model including electric-hydrogen conversion devices and storage systems. This method minimizes the transportation cost of hydrogen by rationally planning the amount of hydrogen tube trailers (HTTs) and transportation routes, realizes cross-space energy scheduling of multi-site PV power generation, and thereby improving the energy supply reliability of HRSs and the consumption rate of PV power generation. The case study indicates that compared with the traditional method, the planning method proposed in this article reduces the operating cost by 32.5%, and the total cost decreases by 8.5%, with the PV power consumption rate along the highway network also improved to a certain extent. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Battery electric vehicles; fuel cell vehicles; highway networks; hybrid refueling stations; hydrogen transportation","Charging (batteries); Electric load dispatching; Energy resources; Fuel cells; Hybrid vehicles; Hydrogen storage; Secondary batteries; Transportation routes; Battery-electric vehicles; Energy; Fuel cell vehicles; Highway networks; Hybrid refueling station; Hydrogen transportation; Power; Power system; Power- generations; Road transportation; Costs","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164410241"

There have been considerable difficulties in analyzing the adoption of all types of EV infrastructure due to the lack of publicly available individual EV user data across various service providers, such as distribution network operators, EV aggregators, EV users, utilities, regulators, and academics. In this study, we introduce the JETPANN (Joint EV energy consumption and charging duration Training Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks), a novel jointly trainable artificial deep neural network framework for predicting stochastic EV user behavior by predicting their stay/charging duration and energy consumption simultaneously. We used a large-scale dataset of individual EV users’ charging transactions collected at a multi-site UCLA campus, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the Port of LA, the City of Santa Monica, and the City of Pasadena over a five-year period. This includes more than 50 EVSEs (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) and 216 EV charging points. Over 50,000 real-time transactions were recorded in our database with 341 distinct EV users. In this research, essential attributes of each charging session were identified, extracted from our database, and then fed into our JETPANN network. Using a jointly trained framework, our AI-enabled network predicts the stay/charging duration and the energy consumption of all the recorded EV users with an accuracy of above 99 percent. The proposed technique was tested and validated using all the collected historical charging data from individual EV users via realizing mean-absolute errors of training loss versus validation loss. Utilizing hyperparameter tuning and semi-grid search, the JETPANN with semi-optimized hyperparameters was achieved with the lowest mean-absolute errors of 0.927 and 0.068 in predicting stay/charging durations and energy consumptions, respectively, in a jointly trainable framework. This study demonstrates the potential of the JETPANN framework in the prediction of EV users’ behavior by using large-scale real-world data collected from a diverse pool of EV users, including faculty and students, occasional and frequent users, and early and late adopters. © 2023 The Author(s)","Charging/stay duration; Deep neural network; Energy consumption; EV (electric vehicle); JETPANN (Joint EV energy and charging duration Training Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks); User behavior","Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Large dataset; Stochastic systems; Charging/stay duration; Electric vehicle; Energy-consumption; JETPANN (joint electric vehicle energy and charging duration training prediction using artificial neural network); Mean absolute error; Stochastics; User behaviors; Vehicle charging; Vehicle energy; Vehicle users; Deep neural networks; artificial neural network; electric vehicle; energy use; fuel cell; infrastructure planning; California; Los Angeles [California]; Pasadena; Santa Monica; United States","Funding text 1: The EV database used in the current research was created by way of a project sponsored in part by LADWP/DOE grant numbers 20699 and 20686 , which were part of the LADWP Smart Grid Regional Demonstration Project awarded to the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and the Smart Grid Energy Research Center (SMERC) at UCLA.

These changes have been primarily driven by changing load profiles, distributed generation sources, and increasingly extreme weather events. Advancements in sensor and communication technologies have played a pivotal role in addressing and adapting to these changes. These changes have also led to an increased focus on reliability and resilience in planning, with priority placed on ensuring robust grid connectivity and flexibility. Three decades ago, power distribution systems were primarily radial with unidirectional power flow. Today’s electrical distribution systems have distributed energy resources, leading to bidirectional power flow. The utility’s geographic information system network, advanced metering infrastructure, and other technologies are leveraged to allow feeders and distributed energy resources to be interconnected. This has facilitated the integration of the electric grid with networked microgrids, which has improved the overall resilience and efficiency of the distribution system. While there have been notable improvements in grid planning, the power grid remains vulnerable to high-impact, low-frequency events caused by climate change, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. This monograph outlines potential solutions for addressing future electric grid issues, including transformer overloading due to electric vehicles, optimization challenges, advanced feeder reconfiguration, and contingency planning for extreme events. The proposed approaches focus on the implementation and operation of new technologies, such as renewable energy sources, batteries, flexible loads, and advanced sensors, that have the potential to transform distribution network planning and operation.

However, unlike conventional petrol vehicles, EVs take a considerable time to charge. EVs on the road with different battery charging statuses and driving demographics may cause uncertain peak time arrivals at charging stations. Battery-swappable charging stations are a quick and easier way to replace uncharged batteries with charged ones. However, charging due to uncertain EV arrival causes higher charging profiles posing load to the grid, management of charged and discharged batteries, and peak time charging tariffs. These challenges hinder the wide operation of battery-swappable charging stations. Nevertheless, a pre-assessment of peak hours using EV demographics can reduce congestion. In recent literature surveys for battery-swappable charging stations, spot congestion has not been given much attention, which has a direct influence on the sizing and operation of battery-swappable charging stations. This research study is focused on estimating peak time events using a novel integrated techno-economic assessment framework. A fuzzy-based parametric assessment tool is developed that identifies the factors that influence higher congestion events. Based on the peak event assessment, grid, and solar PV-based generation is optimized using mixed integer linear programming. In the final step, an environment analysis of a swappable charging station is performed. Furthermore, the results achieved using the proposed framework for battery-swappable charging stations (BSCSs) were compared with fast-charging (FC) stations. FC can economically perform well if integrated with solar PV systems; however, the capital cost is 80% greater than the BSCSs designed under the proposed framework. The operational cost of BSCSs is 39% higher than FC stations as they use 29% higher grid units than FC stations due to night operations under congestion. © 2023 by the authors.","battery-swappable charging; fuzzy-based decision; spot congestion; uncertain peak charging times","design; electric vehicle; environmental impact; estimation method; fuzzy mathematics; photovoltaic system; smart grid","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185919917"

However, improper location and size of the EV charging station (CSs/EVs) negatively affect the power system. It results in some technical challenges such as increased real power-loss, decreased voltage stability and increased voltage deviation. This paper suggests optimum planning of CSs/EVs locations to conserve voltage, improve power-loss and reduce the effect of CSs/EVs in electrical distribution systems. The multi objective genetic algorithm method (MOGA) is utilized to solve the optimization problem and reduce the impact of the random location of CSs/EVs. The simulations are performed on IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus radial distribution systems (RDS). In addition, the optimal EV allocation is carried out with two fixed levels of loading from 100% to 150% of the candidate EV load. A comparison between the proposed MOGA technique and other optimization techniques is carried out. The results demonstrated the capability of the proposed technique for optimal placement of CSs/EVs in RDS.

To address these problems, we propose a coordinated planning method for flexible interconnections and energy storage systems (ESSs) to improve the accommodation capacity of DPVs. First, the power-transfer characteristics of flexible interconnection and ESSs are analyzed. The equipment costs of the voltage source converters (VSCs) and ESSs are also analyzed comprehensively, considering the differences in installation and maintenance costs for different installation locations. Second, a bilevel programming model is established to minimize the annual comprehensive cost and yearly total PV curtailment capacity. Within this framework, the upper-level model optimizes the installation locations and capacities of the VSCs and ESSs, whereas the lower-level model optimizes the operating power of the VSCs and ESSs.

This both comes with potential threats and opportunities, such as sharp stochastic load changes that further burden already stressed power transmission and distribution systems. But opportunities arise from the flexibility that the vehicles batteries charging process could provide, eventually helping in better managing such infrastructures. This paper presents a framework that leverages openly available vehicles mobility-related data sources to define and simulate scenarios of electric mobility adoption, quantifying load and available demand flexibility in such scenarios. In particular, demand flexibility potential is assessed according to different charging strategies, including vehicle to grid, and different vehicles stationing behaviours. The goal is to provide a framework that is potentially of use to a set of different stakeholders, from city planners to grid operators and aggregators, to assess flexibility sources towards several applications. These range from planning for resilience by evaluating flexibility sources for provision of services to the grid, to enabling participation in ancillary services markets. The framework leverages a set of data sources, particularly carparks’ occupancy data in the form of live availability information at high temporal resolution.The framework is applied to a test case in the city of Singapore with the goal to estimate the consumption flexibility available from electric vehicles in carparks throughout the city. Maps that visualize the availability of such flexibility both in space and time are generated based on this assessment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Demand Side Flexibility; Electric Vehicles; Energy planning; Open data; Smart grids; Spatial data","Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Open Data; Stochastic systems; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicle-to-grid; Data-source; Demand side flexibility; Demand-side; Energy planning; Open datum; Singapore; Smart grid; Spatial data; Transport sectors; Transportation system; Electric power transmission","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178414247"

In this paper, we proposed a strategic planning approach for distribution systems integrated with EV charging stations, employing fuzzy Pareto optimality to enhance system performance and minimize carbon emissions. Our approach involves a fuzzy Pareto heuristic network reconfiguration to minimize real power loss and improve voltage profiles. Additionally, Time of Use (ToU) pricing-based EV charging load scheduling is developed to minimize the annual energy cost. These objectives aim to improve minimum node voltage, reduce power losses, and maintain branch current constraints. To simulate the impact of EV charging loads, we aggregate residential, commercial, and industrial loads, along with EV charging loads at charging stations based on customer choice time and ToU pricing methods. The proposed reconfiguration approach is tested on 33 and 69-bus distribution systems with integrated EV charging stations, distributed generations (DGs), and shunt capacitors (SCs). The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the reconfiguration algorithm in enhancing the performance of the distribution network in the presence of EV loads. Furthermore, we compare ToU pricing-based EV charging time zones with customer comfort-based EV charging, showcasing the advantages of the former in reducing emissions through real power loss reduction. Overall, our strategic planning approach not only improves distribution system performance but also offers economic benefits while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; EV charging stations; Pareto optimality; Sustainable EV infrastructure; Time of use pricing","Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric loads; Electric power system economics; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Global warming; Pareto principle; Power quality; Strategic planning; Vehicle performance; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging loads; Charging station; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Pareto-optimality; Performance; Sustainable electric vehicle infrastructure; Systems performance; Time-of-use pricing; Carbon dioxide","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177555658"

Most of the users are ordinary persons and handle such equipment with a rated power of several 100 kW. Until now, equipment with such power ratings was only common in electrical operating facilities such as industrial plants where the users are at least instructed and protective measures are specified. If ordinary persons handle equipment with such power ratings in the field, the question arises as to whether the conventional safety goals are met in the event of an electrical fault. The consideration is: If the power increases so much, it can be assumed that the short-circuit power and thus the fault current increase and so does the risk of a dangerous electric shock. In this contribution, calculations of line-to-earth short-circuits on the low-voltage AC side of the three-phase system and their effects in typical configurations of charging stations are carried out. Considering the electromagnetic interference, the calculations provide the fault current and its distribution to determine the electrical potentials during the fault. From this, the (partial) fault voltages and active fault voltages are calculated. Based on the active fault voltage, the expected body impedance and consequently, the body current can be determined. With the body current and the break time of the protection device the risk of electric shock using international standards as guidelines is evaluated. As a result, recommendations for the planning, installation and safe operation of charging stations are given. It turns out that considering certain aspects like the conductor cross-sections or the electromagnetic interference, the risk of electric shock can be reduced to a conventional level. Periodic testing of the electrical system is necessary for safe and reliable operation. For example, follow-on faults due to unintended, improper use by ordinary persons can be prevented. Also, regular inspection of the electrical system is necessary for safe and reliable operation to prevent hazards due to aging or wear. However, it seems challenging to define an installation guideline that applies to all configurations as the boundary conditions vary depending on the type of system, installations in the area of interference and environmental influences. © 2023, The Author(s).","Body current; Body impedance; Earthing; Electric vehicle charging station; Electromagnetic interference; Equipotential bonding; Protective measures","Automobile bodies; Charging (batteries); Electric fault currents; Electric power distribution; Electric power system protection; Electric vehicles; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic wave interference; Fault detection; Industrial plants; Risk perception; Signal interference; 'current; Body current; Body impedances; Charging station; Electric shock; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Equipotential bonding; Fault voltage; Protective measures; Electric grounding","The ProSafE project is funded in the Collective Research Call (part of ‘Basisprogramm’) of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) and supported by the industry partners Energie Steiermark, KELAG, Wien Energie and TÜV Austria. 2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176736565"

The battery electric vehicle suffers from limited drive range and longer charging duration. The solar cells used in this vehicle not only propel the vehicle but also recharge the onboard batteries. Moreover, the use of solar cells reduces the sizing of batteries hence, the weight and cost of the vehicle also reduced. In this research work the solar-battery hybrid energy source is used and controlled with a microcontroller. The proposed system increases the effective utilization of solar cells and reduces the battery power. Hence, the battery only provides electric power when the motor demand is greater than the solar panel capacity. This will reduce the demand for battery charging from the electric grid so that the energy generation capacity is also reduced. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society for Reliability and Safety (SRESA).","Electric vehicle; Energy management; Power distribution; Solar energy","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173460183"

This study investigates uncoordinated and coordinated charging control strategies of electric vehicle fleets (EVFs) in network-constrained multi-energy systems (NMES). A mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model is presented to capture the nonlinearities in EVFs battery degradation cost, power flow equations of the electric distribution system (EDS) and natural gas network (NGN). To deal with uncertain renewable energy production, a Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework is applied. Moreover, the behavioral uncertainties in EVFs’ traveled distance and arrival/departure times are also taken into account. The model is implemented on two different NMES sizes (one small and one large benchmark systems) to assess the models functionality and scalability in real-world applications. The outcomes illustrate how smart and uncoordinated EVF charging strategies can impact each of these networks, while the proposed DRO model leads a conservative estimation over the probability distribution functions of renewable energy production. Most notably, using the smart charging strategy led to 50.55% reduction in the operational costs of the small test system and 27.83% for the large test system. Furthermore, despite the lowered risk and heightened reliability, the application with DRO model showed 23.67% and 5.88% higher cost for the small and large systems, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Distributionally robust optimization; District heating system; Integrated energy systems; Natural gas network; Second-order cone programming; Vehicle-to-grid","Benchmarking; Charging (batteries); Distribution functions; District heating; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Heating equipment; Integer programming; Vehicle-to-grid; Distributionally robust optimization; District heating system; Integrated energy systems; Multi-energy systems; Natural gas networks; Renewable energies; Robust optimization; Second-order cone programming; Vehicle fleets; Vehicle to grids","This work was supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) LightGridSEED Project, ref.

Hence, this article introduces a tri-stage mechanism for the joint management of the energy and ancillary services markets in coordinated TN and DN, taking into account wind and solar renewable resources, SHs and EVs. In the first stage of this mechanism, SHs do their daily planning with the possibility of participating in the regulation market and send it to the DN operator. In the second stage, DN operator determines its strategy for participation in the energy and ancillary services markets according to the programs received from SHs and sends it to the TN operator. Finally, in the third stage, the TN operator settles the markets according to the plans received from the DN operators. This model is designed in the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) format and simulated using CPLEX solver in GAMS. The simulation outputs illustrate that SHs by controlling their internet-of-things (IoT)-based appliances and EVs have provided cheap services in the regulation market and subsequently reduced the costs of this market by 10.4%.

Consequently, it has migrated from internal combustion to electric vehicles (EVs). However, it is essential to ensure the deployment of electric vehicle charging station infrastructures (EVCSI) to guarantee their interoperability for the development of electric mobility. Moreover, the sustainability of EVCSI depends not only on the capacity to meet demand but also on the adequate number of terminals in the different public charging stations (CS) to reduce waiting times for battery recharging. Then to achieve an optimal sizing of charging stations, it is crucial to foresee the maximum number of vehicles that could use the different CS during a time interval. The sizing of CS must respond to real mobility constraints and technical conditions, such as the capacity of vehicular flow, the capacity of the roads according to their geometry, the trajectories marked by the users, and the possible exit of operation of some CS. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem considering four fundamental axes, which are: stochastic analysis of heterogeneous vehicular flow, a solution to the transportation problem with the capacitated multicommodity flow problem and Hungarian algorithm, analysis of the optimal number of terminals considering loading times, and finally the proposed EVCSI will be validated using the CymDist software for electrical engineering.

Here, we assess the impact of demand and supply side-drivers on the long-term evolution of the electricity sector in India under various technology and policy scenarios. Our analysis is based on developing: (a) multiple demand scenarios produced from a bottom-up forecasting model with high temporal resolution that capture structural changes in electricity consumption resulting from (AC) and electric vehicle (EV) adoption, and (b) a multi-period power system capacity expansion model with high temporal resolution of grid operations to model supply-side evolution in response to changes in demand and technology and policy factors. Such a framework allows us to, for example, quantify the impacts of improving appliance efficiency standards for AC systems or shifts in EV charging patterns on power system decarbonization prospects. Under projected renewables and Li-ion storage cost declines, our modeling points to solar and wind generation contributing substantially (46–67%) to meet annual electricity demand in India by 2030. However, without appropriate policy measures to phase out existing coal generation, even such rapid adoption of variable renewable energy coupled with one or more technological levers such as low-cost energy storage and demand-side measures such as setting aggressive AC efficiency standards and deploying distribution level storage, are insufficient to reduce annual CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in 2050 vs. 2020 because of the relatively higher growth rate of projected electricity demand over this period. This suggests that deep decarbonization of India's power sector will require policy measures beyond efforts related to accelerating renewables deployment. © 2023","Decarbonization; Emerging markets; Energy storage; Space cooling","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153317238"

At its core, electrification relies on integrating insights that span the supply and demand side of power systems, resolving operational characteristics and long-term climate change, and the integration of previously independent engineered systems. However, our modeling landscape consists of a suite of models that focus on distinct sectors (power, buildings, transport) and spatial–temporal scales (municipal, provincial, federal). This paper probes whether the existing suite of energy system models, which span sectors, disciplines, and jurisdictions, is up to the task of charting net-zero pathways, specifically in the Canadian context. To do so, we analyze an inventory of energy system models that are being used in practice using a recently assembled model database. Next, we supplement our analysis with a web-based search and literature review. For each model category, we describe the key modeling approaches, strengths and weaknesses, and typical ways and areas in which these models are applied. We find that by focusing on a specific scale and sector, these models by their very definition, omit out-of-scope interactions leaving critical information gaps. Many of the most imperative areas for future research straddle multiple sectors or multiple scales—electric vehicle charging, carbon policy coordination, regional electricity trading, to name a few. Future research should focus on identifying ways in which different models could be used together to produce policy-related conclusions that are as detailed but more holistic than conclusions that can be gleaned from an individual model. © 2023 The Author(s)","Decarbonization pathways; Electrification; Energy system modeling; Energy systems integration","Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Electric utilities; Building systems; Decarbonisation; Decarbonization pathway; Electrification; Energy system integration; Energy systems; Energy-system models; Power; System integration; Zero-emission energy systems; Decarbonization","We would like to thank Normand Mousseau, Louis Beaumier and the Energy Modelling Initiative team for their invaluable work developing the model inventory and supporting this work.

The impact of EVs cannot be decoupled from the power generation. Therefore, in this study, New Zealand's energy system (transport and national power generation) is modelled in LEAP and the impacts of a 40% transition to EVs assessed with a multiple-scenario 2019-based retro-analysis. Two charging scenarios are simulated, modelling “Optimistic” and “Concentrated” charging. Two methods of generation expansion are modelled: “Mixed Renewables” and “Non-Renewables”. Results show existing generation can support a 16% EV transition with Concentrated charging, and a 43% transition with Optimistic charging, without decreasing the reserve margin. It is expected a 40% EV transition with a Non-Renewable power system expansion will reduce energy sector GHG emissions by 2% and costs by 7%, and a Mixed Renewables expansion will reduce emissions by 17%–18% and costs by 4%–5%. These results suggest an EV transition is an effective method for New Zealand to meet GHG emission targets, particularly with renewable generation expansion.

The enormous energy demands of FCEVS, as well as the inclusion of renewable energy resources (RES) into utility grids, may have a significant influence on system reliability and pose challenges owing to uncertainty. Therefore, a new reliability-oriented analysis-based two-stage planning framework for optimal deployment of solar photovoltaic (SPV) powered FCEVS and battery energy storage systems (BESS) in coupled transportation and distribution networks is proposed in this article, while encapsulating the complex interactions between EVs, SPVs, and BESS. A novel composite metric, the average voltage deviation reliability index (AVDRI), has been developed for the deployment of FCEVS infrastructure considering the goals and limitations of both distribution and transportation networks. Models such as the demand for charging electric vehicles, the reliability evaluation system, and the economic analysis model are offered to provide essential inputs for the study of distribution network reliability and profitability. In the first stage, AVDRI, active power loss, captured EV flow, and capital, along with operating and maintenance costs of the FEVCS and SPV system, are all taken into consideration as objectives when optimizing the placement and sizing of SPV assisted FCEVS using Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and a fuzzy satisfaction-based hybrid technique. Then, the optimal resource sizing, such as the count of charging spaces, the capacity of the SPV system at each optimal FCEVS, and captured EV flow, are estimated. In the second step, a bi-section approach is used to compute the capacity of the BESS and the extra SPV rating necessary to power it at each optimal FCEVS location, taking into account the irradiance profile for all conceivable seasons within a planning year. A 25-node transportation network coupled to an IEEE 33 bus distribution system is used to validate the proposed methodology under a range of seasonal scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Battery electric storage system; Electric vehicle charging station; MOPSO; Optimization; Power distribution system; Reliability indices; Solar PV system","Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Economic analysis; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Multiobjective optimization; Reliability analysis; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Battery electric storage system; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Optimisations; Power-distribution system; Reliability Index; Solar PV systems; Storage systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169781893"

Reducing pollution can be realized through optimal planning of charging and discharging of electric vehicles as consumers and storage of electric energy. Also, vehicles connected to the network increase the reliability of the network during power outages. However, the connection of electric vehicles to the grid can also bring limitations. The uncoordinated and unmanaged presence of electric vehicles as an additional load in the network can aggravate problems such as voltage drop, voltage stability and increase in network losses. Consequently, these problems will have economic costs. In this way, the management of charging and discharging of electric vehicles will be of special importance in the future of control and operation of distribution networks. In this article, electric vehicle charging and discharging management has been done in order to minimize the amount of active power loss, bus voltage deviation, increase the stability of the network voltage, and as a result, reduce the costs of the distribution company. For this purpose, a 33-bus distribution network that absorbed its required energy only through the connection point to the network was studied with different scenarios in which the objective function of the problem was different. The proposed algorithm was implemented to calculate the best state of charging and discharging of cars. In choosing these vehicles, it has been tried to examine all charging modes.

Here, an innovative scenario-based energy hub energy management system (EH-EMS) is proposed for simultaneous cost and emission reduction considering the abovementioned uncertainties. Moreover, a multi objective hybrid heuristic algorithm, the so-called hBES-MOGWO, is introduced for solving the proposed EH-EMS, which is a combination of bald eagle search (BES) and multi objective gray wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithms. The proposed EH consists of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), boiler, heat storage (HS),combined heat and power (CHP) and multi-carrier energy storage technology such as power to gas (PtG) technology, electric vehicles and heat storages. Flexible loads are also taken into account for reducing cost and emission by participation in demand response programs (DRPs). The optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hBES-MOGWO algorithm. The simulation results illustrated that the total cost of EH-EMS can be effectively reduced by installing energy storage systems and implementing DRPs. The results emphasize that considering uncertainties can lead to increase the operating costs and emission, while flexible loads participation in DRPs and PtG can reduce the aforementioned ones. © 2023 The Authors.

Renewable fluctuations in the supply side and EV charging burden in the demand side propose higher requirements for the system flexibility. Optimized station layout and charging schedule could coordinate the load curve, provide system flexibility and accommodate the variable renewables. However, previous work only focuses on maximizing the profit of station holders and vehicle owners, lacking the consideration of the broader impact on power system. Here, we propose an EV charging station layout optimization methodology considering not only the EV charging behavior, sequential charging demand, but also its further impact on power system. The station layout and charging schedule are co-optimized with an integrated power system model. Applying the proposed methodology to Jiangxi in 2025, a cumulative charging station capacity of 1412, 1092, and 1415 MW is recommended in workplaces, residences, and shopping centers, respectively. Increased renewable energy integration and decreased thermal power generation are realized, achieving reduced carbon emissions of 800 kilotons.

However, in cities with different travel patterns for electric vehicle drivers, such consideration may result in charging equipment serving few electric vehicles during high recharging demand. Thus, planning by zone can determine more chargers per station with greater utilization during the operation of charging stations. For this, this work presents a methodology that uses the concept of a charging zone, defined as a circular geographic space with charging equipment that will satisfy the charging demand of electric vehicles in their surroundings. Identifying the centroids of these zones is formulated as a p-median problem, solved by the Teitz-Bart algorithm to provide more coverage to the demands for electric charging in large urban areas. The proposed methodology was applied in a Brazilian city with approximately 3 million inhabitants to find the spatial distribution of public charging zones, considering six scenarios of the global penetration of electric vehicles. Furthermore, we compared the allocation of the centroids in these zones with the solution determined by commercial geoprocessing software. This comparison shows that the proposal determines a spatial distribution of 10% more of these zones with a load factor closer to 0.5 than the results of the commercial geoprocessing software. More zones with this load factor value contribute to better use of the power distribution network installations. In addition, the proposed methodology finds an average reduction of 319 kW of peak demand in regions with a low flow of electric vehicles to meet their charging needs in each analyzed scenario. This peak-demand reduction may allow less investment in connecting future charging stations to the power distribution network. Therefore, the proposed methodology can help public and private agents to disseminate electric mobility, finding public charging areas with greater utilization of chargers per station during the operation of charging stations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","charging infrastructure planning; Location-allocation; Optimization; Power distribution system planning; Public charging station","Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric network analysis; Electric vehicles; Investments; Urban planning; Charging infrastructure planning; Charging infrastructures; Charging station; Geoprocessing; Infrastructure planning; Location-allocation; Optimisations; Power distribution system planning; Public charging station; Urban areas; Electric power distribution; algorithm; distribution system; electric vehicle; equipment; optimization; p-median; penetration; spatial distribution","The authors would like to thank ANEEL, and the NEOENERGIA group for the financial and technical support provided in the scope of the ANEEL P&D project “Green Corridor and Charging Stations for Performance Evaluation of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles.” Process: 23006.001802/2019–09.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166284251"

This paper proposes a two-stage EV coordination framework for MPDN smart restoration. The first stage is to introduce a novel proactive EV prepositioning model to optimize planning prior to a rare event, and thereby enhance the MPDN survivability in its immediate aftermath. The second stage involves creating an advanced spatial–temporal EV dispatch model to maximize the number of available EVs for discharging, thereby improving the MPDN recovery after a rare event. The proposed framework also includes an information system to further enhance MPDN resilience by effectively organizing data exchange among intelligent transportation system and smart charging system, and EV users. In addition, a novel bidirectional geographic graph is proposed to optimize travel plans, covering a large penetration of EVs and considering variations in traffic conditions. The effectiveness is assessed on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder with real-world transportation and charging infrastructure.

Nevertheless, the increased utilization of EVs poses challenges for the distribution system's efficiency. The strategic placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) is crucial in maintaining the reliability of the radial distribution system (RDS). The improper allocation of EVCS can result in degradation and affect the distribution system. To overcome this issue, a potential solution involves integrating the charging stations with the RDS by utilizing distribution static compensators (DSTATCOMs) and distributed generation (DG) to mitigate the adverse effects of EVCS on the RDS. The appropriate sizing of DG/DSTATCOM depends on variations in load stages, as it impacts the stability of the RDS. Additionally, the uncertainty of distribution loads can lead to an underestimation of power within the system, posing a primary challenge. In this proposed work, two studies were examined: (i) DG and DSTATCOM allocation considering load uncertainty without EVCS impact, and (ii) DG and DSTATCOM allocation considering load uncertainty with EVCS impact. To address this multi-objective problem, an objective function was developed to reduce real power loss while adhering to system equality and inequality constraints. To tackle the challenge, the researchers used the bald eagle search algorithm (BESA), a revolutionary metaheuristic optimization methodology. The efficacy of the proposed approach was validated using two test systems: a 34-bus system and a 118-bus system. The results obtained from these test cases demonstrate that the BESA-based solution is highly exact in reducing real power loss, increasing bus voltage, and enhancing system stability with a significantly high convergence rate. Hence, the proposed approach presents a promising solution for optimizing RDS with multiple objectives. © 2023 The Authors","Bald Eagle Search Algorithm (BESA); Curve Fitting Technique (CFT); Distributed generation (DG); Distribution network operators (DNOs); Distribution STATicCOMpensator (DSTATCOM); Electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs); Electrical vehicles (EVs); Radial distribution system (RDS); Uncertainty in load; Voltage stability index (VSI)","Constraint theory; Convergence of numerical methods; Curve fitting; Electric loads; Electric vehicles; Learning algorithms; Optimization; System stability; Bald eagle search algorithm; Bald eagles; Charging station; Curve fitting technique; Distributed generation; Distribution network operator; Distribution network operators; Distribution staticcompensator; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Electrical vehicle; Electrical vehicles; Radial distribution system; Radial distribution systems; Search Algorithms; Uncertainty; Uncertainty in load; Voltage stability index; Voltage-stability index; Distributed power generation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169000862"

This device can inject active power from DC side and also compensate var on AC side to maintain voltage stability of the network. The DC side of the PV-DSTATCOM is also utilized for an EVCS, drawing power from PV source or the distribution grid based on PV availability and demand at a given time. The point of common coupling (PCC) of the PV-DSTATCOM is determined by the proposed method for IEEE-38 bus system. It uses modal analysis with sensitivity indices to assess the voltage stability and find critical buses where PV-DSTATCOMs can be placed to improve the overall network stability. The method also combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) for optimal sizing of the PV-DSTATCOM with EVCS provision. In addition, this work proposes a dynamic pricing scheme using an adaptively trained artificial neural network (ANN) for EVCSs to effectively manage demands during peak hours (thereby improving network stability) and benefit EV users in terms of charge per kWh of electricity depending upon the present state of charge (SOC) of their vehicle battery and the level of congestion at EVCS.

However, integrating the XFCS with a high-capacity power converter into the power distribution network (PDN) is difficult and uneconomical due to the restrictions regarding urban planning and high investment in PDN expansion. Considering the fluctuation in the EV charging demand and the limited capacity of the power converter, a collaborative policy for real-time EV charging power allocation and BES discharging power control is proposed based on Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is solved by the constraint deep deterministic policy gradient (CDDPG). The proposed model makes it possible to integrate the XFCS with reduced capacity power converter into the PDN with a minimal negative impact on the quality of service (QoS) of EV owners.

To enhance the security of the coupled network and ensure the reliability of the charging/refueling services of EVs, a vulnerability assessment is required to assist in system contingency planning as well as post-contingency measures. In this paper, a vulnerability assessment strategy is formulated for coupled transportation and multi-energy networks. First, a novel graph representation for the coupled transportation and multi-energy networks is proposed. Then, a critical asset identification tool is applied to find the vulnerability point of the coupled networks, and the transfer margin ratio (TMR) is put forward to assess the dynamic vulnerability level under cascading contingencies. Finally, a vulnerability envelope (the lower bound and upper bound of vulnerability) is found based on a bi-level optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, case studies are performed on the IEEE 39-bus electricity network coupled with a 25-node transportation network and a 50-node hydrogen/gas network. It is verified that the vulnerable point of the coupled network can be found.

However, a continuous increase in the penetration of such elements would bring more complexities to the distribution network. Accordingly, this paper presents a unified planning model comprising renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG), ESS, and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). In this regard, a Latin Hypercube Sampling method is utilized to generate multi-scenario for describing the uncertainty of renewable energy and load demand. The stochastic EV charging behaviors are represented by various probability density functions (PDF). In addition, an exploitable capacity loss of ESS and EV batteries is calculated by the battery degradation model based on the depth of discharge (DOD). Furthermore, the battery degradation cost is incorporated into the objective of the planning model to identify the optimal decision for candidate assets. A piecewise linearization approach is introduced to convert the problem into a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Numerical results demonstrate that the exploitable capacity loss of batteries plays a key role in asset planning and provides potential contributions to the optimal decisions of the distribution network.

Their travel and charging behaviors have an impact on both the power grid and the road network. In order to address the potential impacts of a large-scale deployment of EVs on the power grid and the exacerbation of traffic congestion, this paper first establishes a dynamic road network model based on graph theory and time-varying traffic data combined with a road impedance model. Then, the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of EV travel are modeled. Furthermore, by incorporating real-time road network data, the traditional Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the optimal path is improved. At each node, the current real-time road impedance is used as the objective for EV path updates, thus accurately capturing the energy consumption of the EVs. Finally, using a standard testing problem on a typical working day based on data from a real case, the impacts of EV travel and charging behaviors on power distribution network operation and traffic congestion are analyzed under scenarios with no guidance and guidance for the shortest travel time. The results show that this method can significantly reduce the time cost by approximately 18% in travel time, which is of particular concern to users. This method balances the load of the charging stations, elevates the voltage level within the safety requirement of 7%, and simultaneously alleviates traffic congestion near the stations. © 2023 by the authors.","electric vehicles; power–traffic coupling network; route planning; traffic impedance","","This research was funded by the Jiebangguashuai project of Inner Mongolia, grant number 2022JBGS0043.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187294416"

Due to the diminishing availability of fossil fuels and the carbon emissions produced by cars, electric vehicles (EV) have become a need for mobility in the near future. Electric car charging stations were established as a consequence of the increase in EVs. Electric car charging lowers voltage and increases real power loss in the radial distribution network. In order to mitigate real power loss and provide a stable voltage profile, the charging station has to be placed as efficiently as possible. The current research examines and elucidates the influence of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) on the balanced radial distribution network (BRDN) using particle swarm optimization (PSO). There are two steps involved in the planning process. The optimal placement for EVCS [1] in BRDN is identified in the first stage using PSO. The second stage uses reconfiguration to ensure higher EVCS stability. This two-step technique's main goal is to decrease the real power loss due to the placement of charging stations in the radial distribution network (RDN). The correctness of the suggested approach is expounded upon in four different cases. The second, third, and fourth cases use a two-step procedure, which is then compared to the base case. In the base case EVCS is ideally located in BRDN using PSO. The fourth case employs a concurrent two-step optimization approach and demonstrates superior performance compared to other cases. The suggested approach is implemented and evaluated on the IEEE 69 bus BRDN using the MATLAB software. © 2023 by the Dandu Srinivas and Dr. M.

A smart grid achieves such aforementioned power supply by ensuring resilient energy delivery, which presents opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of power supply and minimize environmental impacts. A systematic evaluation of the comprehensive benefits brought by smart grid to smart cities can provide necessary theoretical fundamentals for urban planning and construction towards a sustainable energy future. However, most of the present methods of assessing smart cities do not fully take into account the benefits expected from the smart grid. To comprehensively evaluate the development levels of smart cities while revealing the supporting roles of smart grids, this article proposes a model of smart city development needs from the perspective of residents’ needs based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory, which serves the primary purpose of building a smart city. By classifying and reintegrating the needs, an evaluation index system of smart grids supporting smart cities was further constructed. A case analysis concluded that smart grids, as an essential foundation and objective requirement for smart cities, are important in promoting scientific urban management, intelligent infrastructure, refined public services, efficient energy utilization, and industrial development and modernization. Further optimization suggestions were given to the city analyzed in the case include strengthening urban management and infrastructure constructions, such as electric vehicle charging facilities and wireless coverage. © 2023","Benefits of smart grid; Evaluation index system; Hierarchy of needs; Smart city; Smart grid","Cost effectiveness; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Smart city; Urban growth; Benefit of smart grid; Clean power; Evaluation indices system; Evaluation models; Hierarchy of need; Intelligent electrical network; Power supply; Smart grid; Urban management; Smart power grids","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175578149"

However, energy storage is challenging for prosumers due to high investment costs and long payback periods. The second use of batteries has been evaluated as an alternative energy storage after the first service in electric vehicles with the remaining 80% capacity. This study investigates the feasibility of using secondary-use batteries as shared storage for prosumers. Financial and technical break-even points regarding the gradually increasing carbon limit on the way to 100% renewable have been determined. The proposed method's performance has been verified by conducting sensitivity analyses regarding various environmental and economic characteristics. The self-consumption rates have been achieved by 65.9% in Spain (Madrid) and 49.9% in England (London), and 48.5% in Türkiye (Antalya) without incentive. Increasing the carbon tax by 1 $/t for high and low energy tariffs can reduce carbon emissions by 181.3 and 1607 kg/yr. The optimum sizes remain until the carbon tax threshold is 60 $/tCO<inf>2</inf>eq for high energy tariffs. After 60 $/tCO<inf>2</inf>eq, it is tended to enlarge the hybrid power system. However, severe carbon emission restriction for zero carbon targets prevents the optimum system design since the carbon reduction cost increases to 232.7–304.8 $/kg.

While their over-sizing is an unfortunate waste, their under-utilization creates the major hurdle for the integration of renewables into these grids due to the lack of a base load. Therefore, integrating smart grid loads such as EV chargers is not only an opportunity but a necessity for the sustainable transport grid of the future. This paper examines six methods for increasing the potential of EV chargers in three case studies of a trolleygrid, namely a higher substation no-load voltage, a higher substation power capacity, a smart charging method, adding a third overheard parallel line, adding a bilateral connection, and installing a multi-port converter between two substations. From the case studies, the most promising and cost-effective method seems to be introducing a bilateral connection, bringing a charging capacity for up to 175 electric cars per day. Meanwhile, other costly and complex methods, such as smart charging with grid state sensors and communication, can offer charging room for over 200 electric cars per day. Furthermore, using solar PV systems to power the grid showed a more than doubling of the directly utilized energy by installing a 150kW charger, from 19% to 41%. This reduces the power mismatch between the trolleygrid and the PV system from 81% to 59% and thereby reduces the severe economic need for storage, AC grid power exchange, or PV power curtailment while allowing a high penetration of renewables. © 2023 The Author(s)","DC grids; EV chargers; PV system; Transportation; Trolleygrids","Electric loads; Electric substations; Electric traction; Smart power grids; Urban transportation; Case-studies; DC grid; Electric cars; Electric transport; EV charger; Power; PV system; Smart charging; Traction substation; Trolleygrid; Cost effectiveness","This research was funded by the Trolley2.0 project of Electric Mobility Europe .","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167521822"

In this article, the problem of planning the flexibility of electric vehicle charging and discharging to coordinate with wind and solar production and to compensate for the uncertainty of these resources has been solved using the CPLEX solver. Also, in this article, the flexibility of charging and discharging of electric vehicles has been used to coordinate with wind and solar production and compensate for the uncertainty of these sources. In addition, the EVs (Electric Vehicles) are planned in such a way that the operating cost of the microgrid is minimized. To consider the uncertainty related to loading, wind, and solar production, different scenarios have been considered and programming in R language has been done. These scenarios have been considered using the time series method of data determination and correlation. Due to the high number of scenarios and the increase in the volume of calculations, the scenario reduction method is used, then several scenarios with the highest probability of occurrence are selected and optimization is done. The simulation is done using GAMS software. The optimization problem is solved by integer linear programming. The results indicate that the cost is reduced by considering the uncertainties, through optimal planning for the EVs, and it is also profitable for the operator. © 2023","Consumption management; Electric vehicle; Optimization; Smart grid","Computer software; Integer programming; Solar cells; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Co-ordinated control; Consumption management; Coordinated control; New energies; Optimisations; Smart grid; Solar production; Uncertainty; Wind farm; Winds blowing; Electric vehicles; control system; electric vehicle; exploitation; optimization; uncertainty analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167437719"

Electric vehicles are slowly but surely gaining a foothold in India's rapidly expanding market. With more EVs on the road, there will be more demand for charging and more energy use in some places, which can put a lot of stress on the power grid. In the absence of sufficient planning, there is a risk of power system interruption and failure. Therefore, the need for energy in cities will shift in light of the advent of EVs in the next decade or two. Accordingly, Surat has been chosen as the research region for the planning of charging infrastructure in the current study. After reviewing the literature, primary data was acquired to estimate citizen travel demands. Vehicle registration statistics were compiled from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for the purpose of EV forecasting. After collecting data, the EV population and demand for public charging stations by 2025 and 2030 were calculated. This study aims to meet the public charging demand in the city of Surat by analyzing the electric vehicle growth rate and vehicle forecast. This anticipated data was then utilized to compute the energy demand consumption for Surat city by calculating vehicle kilometers traveled. The demand for public charging comes out to be 42.4 MWh/day in 2025 and 358.05 MWh/day in 2030, respectively.

The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), behind-the-meter (BTM) solar, and heat pumps will significantly change the amount and variability of loads. Electrification adoption and load forecasting in arctic regions and Alaska is limited. This paper provides the first load and electrification adoption forecast for the Alaska Railbelt transmission system, including yearly adoption rates of EVs, BTM solar, and heat pumps and hourly load data for the forecasted year of 2050. The adoption rates were based on the available historical data and compared to other regional and national trends. Two forecasts were created: (1) a moderate adoption forecast based on projections from current adoption rates and comparisons to other regional and national projections and (2) an aggressive forecast, which provides an illustrative comparison of a high adoption rate of 90% for all technologies. The results of these forecasts demonstrate a significant increase in both energy, 80% and 116%, and peak load demand, 113% and 219%, for the moderate and aggressive electrification adoption scenarios, respectively. These findings highlight a need for resource planning and demand management in this region due to the adoption of EVs, BTM solar, and heat pumps. © 2023 by the authors.","Alaska; electric vehicles; electrification; heat pumps; load forecast; Railbelt; solar","Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Resource allocation; Alaska; Electrification; Heat pumps; Load forecast; Load forecasting; Railbelt; Resource planning; Solar; Solar pumps; Transmission systems; Electric vehicles","This project is part of the Arctic Regional Collaboration for Technology Innovation and Commercialization (ARCTIC) 2 Program—Innovation Network, an initiative supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Award #N00014-22-1-2049.

The TVPP exploits diverse distributed energy resources’ (DERs) flexibility capabilities in order to offer flexibility services to wholesale flexibility market as well as preserving the distribution network's operational constraints in the presence of DER uncertainties. The TVPP aims at maximizing its profit in energy and flexibility markets considering the worst-case uncertainty realization. In the proposed framework, the first stage models the TVPP's participation strategy in day-ahead energy market and determines the DERs’ optimal energy dispatch. The second stage addresses the TVPP's strategy in intra-day flexibility market to determine the DERs’ optimal flexibility capability provision by adjusting their energy dispatch for the worst-case realization of uncertainties. The uncertainty characteristics associated with photovoltaic units, electric vehicles, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and other responsive loads as well as the transmission network's flexibility capability requests are considered using an adaptive robust approach. Adopting the duality theory, the model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and is solved using a column-and-constraint generation algorithm.

The method employs multi-objective optimization to address the commercial interests of the utility and the EVCS owner separately. In this manner, the utility makes investment decisions for network assets, such as replacing overloaded conductors and installing capacitor banks and voltage regulators, whereas the EVCS owner decides on the purchase of land and infrastructure for the EVCS installation. Furthermore, as an outstanding feature, the proposed formulation incorporates network reconfiguration within the planning options. The proposed model aims to minimize the total expected cost for both owners. A travel simulation algorithm provides the EVCS load profiles. At the same time, scenario-based optimization addresses uncertainties related to substation energy prices, wind speed, solar irradiance, electricity demand, adoption rate, and loading profile of plug-in electric vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been demonstrated in a 69-node network. The findings show that when deciding where to install the EVCS (network node), the objectives of both owner's clash. This discrepancy, however, can be reduced through network reconfiguration.

Uncontrolled EV charging can reduce electric grid efficiency and increase greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). This occurs when EV charging aligns with peak demand, requiring the activation of fossil fuel-powered plants to meet the electricity demand. The time-of-use (TOU) price is a traditional management strategy for smoothing the demand power curve, but it does not consider carbon emissions. This study proposes a smart charging strategy based on an improved local search genetic algorithm (LS-GA) that considers both the TOU price and marginal emission factors (MEF). Over 47,000 charging events from 45 charging stations in Tianjin, a major city in North China, were used to simulate the charging pattern and demand. Four different charging strategies are considered in the study. The results indicate that the proposed smart charging strategy can reduce the cost and carbon emissions by up to 27% and 16% compared with uncontrolled charging, respectively. This study demonstrates the significant potential of using optimization methods in the EV smart charging problem. © 2023","Electric vehicle; Marginal carbon emission factor; Smart charging; Time-of-use price","Carbon; Charging (batteries); Curve fitting; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Carbon emission factors; Carbon emissions; Charging strategies; Electric grids; Electric vehicle charging; Emission time; Grid efficiency; Marginal carbon emission factor; Smart charging; Time-of-use prices; Genetic algorithms; carbon emission; demand-side management; efficiency measurement; electric vehicle; energy resource; genetic algorithm; infrastructural development; price determination; strategic approach; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning","The funding supports from the State Key Laboratory of Reliability and Intelligence of Electrical Equipment (no.

Inappropriate installation of EV charging stations (EVCS) degrades the distribution network's power quality, affecting smooth functioning. This article proposes a novel strategy for properly allocating EVCS in a distribution system by analyzing the impact of power quality issues, namely harmonics and loss of life of the distribution transformer. The analysis is carried out in a standard IEEE-33 bus radial distribution system and a real-time distribution system in Kerala, India. The impact of power quality issues is highlighted by perceiving the effect of slow/moderate and fast chargers in the system under study. The results substantiate the potency of the reliability index (RI) strategy. The severity level for planning the charging station (CS) in numerous buses in the distribution network without infrastructural upgrades is determined by employing a modified novel EV placement index (EVPI m ). The novelty of the index lies in the fact that it incorporates all of the operational parameters with a specific focus on the power quality issues in the distribution network. The severity level of the EVPI m maintains the power quality without increasing the rating of the components used or any infrastructural upgrades. The sensitivity analysis results prove the robustness of the modified EVPI-based strategy. Moreover, the proposed strategy is validated using real-time experiments on a hardware-in-loop real-time simulator, OPAL-RT OP4510. The results substantiate the efficacy of the strategy and the modified index. © 1975-2012 IEEE.","","Charging (batteries); Electric transformers; Electric vehicles; Interactive computer systems; Quality control; Real time systems; Sensitivity analysis; Adverse effect; Charging station; Distribution network operation; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Large-scale deployment; Proper allocations; Quality issues; Real - Time system; Transformer; Power quality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159641690"

The model presents a plan for enhancing the interconnection of renewable energy sources (RESs), stationary battery energy storage systems (SBESSs), and power electric vehicles parking lots (PEV-PLs), which are used in the distribution system (DS), to get the optimal planning under normal and resilient operation. The stochastic optimization technique is used to model the influence of upstream grid pricing uncertainty on the optimal scheduling of (DS). Other major uncertainties, such as wind power, photovoltaic (PV), and active/reactive power for different types of electrical loads, are also simulated using stochastic optimization. In addition, demand response programs (DRP) and interruptible loads are introduced to enhance the resilient operation of the DS.

In addition, EVs can be employed as a temporary energy storage system (ESS) in electrical power systems using the grid-to-vehicle (G2V), charging phase, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G), discharging phase, technologies. Renewable energy resources (RERs) are a clean and sustainable form of energy but are often intermittent in nature. Integrating ESS with RERs can mitigate the unpredictable fluctuations of the electrical power generated from RERs, but the investment cost of installing ESS is often high. In this article, we investigate the financial benefit obtained from using EVs as a temporary ESS in a microgrid (MG) integrated with a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The problem formulation considers the capital cost of the EV charging stations (EVCSs), feed-in tariff (FIT), and incentives given to the EVs' owners. A planning algorithm is developed to find the required number of EVCSs needed to maximize the profit of the suggested system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using the Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) MG. Four different final state of charge (SC) of EV scenarios are considered.

EVs can participate as a manufacturer in the electricity market through Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technology. This greatly improves the reliability of distribution systems. Therefore, it is necessary to plan the charging and discharging processes in the parking lot. This paper investigated di erent strategies for planning the charging and discharging processes of EVs considering the random and unpredictable nature of various parameters, as well as the limitation of the power exchange between the distribution system and parking, to evaluate the impact of V2G-equipped parking lots on reliability. An appropriate strategy is the strategy that increases the owner's interest in the parking. Therefore, the strategies are designed independent of the duration of EVs presence in the parking and considering the limitations of power exchange with the distribution system. In addition, the improvement of the reliability of the distribution system and the economic bene ts of V2G are examined simultaneously. The results indicate that V2G and charge-discharge strategies increase the parking revenue by an average of 21.6% and improve reliability (System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), Average Service Availability Index (ASAI), and Energy Not Supplied (ENS) indices) of the distribution network by 8.8%. © 2023 Sharif University of Technology.

The battery swapping station (BSS) is transferred seasonally and integrated to different buses in various seasons in order to defer the investment on the new lines. The BSS is as well integrated with rooftop solar panels. The uncertainties of loads and renewable energies are taken into account and handled by stochastic programming. The charging scheduling is optimized for all the batteries inside the BSS. A comparative study is presented for 3 cases including expansion planning without BSS, planning with a fixed location of BSS, and the proposed method (i.e., planning with seasonally transferred BSS). The numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed model transfers the BSS every six months, where, it is installed on bus 25 in seasons 1 and 2, and on bus 17 in seasons 3 and 4. The congested lines such as lines 2 to 19, 16 to 17, and 6 to 7 are expanded by installing new lines in years 2, 4, and 5, respectively. The BSS sends power to the external grid in on-peak loading times such as hours 12 to 15 and 18 to 21.

This study proposed a heterogeneous spatial–temporal graph convolutional network to predict the EV charging demand at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Specifically, we first learned the spatial correlations between charging regions by constructing heterogeneous graphs, i.e., a geographic graph and a demand graph. Then, we used graph convolutional layers and gated recurrent units to extract spatio-temporal features in the observations. Further, we designed a region-specific prediction module that grouped regions based on graph embedding and point of interest (POI) data for prediction. We used a large real-world GPS dataset which contained over 76,000 private EVs in Beijing for model training and validation. The results showed that, compared with recently popular spatio-temporal prediction methods, the proposed model had superior prediction accuracy and steady performance at different scales of regions.

The mentioned phenomenon will intensify by high WP penetration into the power system. In addition, incorporating plugged-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the power system along with the WP intermittent will increase the vagueness rating of the problem. Due to the expansion and development of battery energy storage (BES), the possibility of power shortage compensating and accumulating additional power produced by wind farms (WFs) has been engendered. Providing a stochastic scenario-based structure with different correlation levels can increase the robustness of the model. Here, a two-stage model has been proposed to overcome such a high-dimensioned problem. The first stage determined the scheduled power output of thermal generators (TGs) as the unit commitment (UC) problem to minimize operational costs. Next, by reckoning the supplementary constraints, the scheduled WP, which is re-optimized, will be obtained. The second stage has employed to detect the BES capacity. In this stage, the intelligent parking lots (IPLs) assign price-based signal impetus to the PHEVs to participate in economic dispatch. Due to the prominence of being equipped with the supreme decision-making facility for the intelligent decision-maker operator (IDMO), the augmented epsilon-constraint method has been employed to capture the Pareto sets of some multi-objective functions. The optimum solution has been selected by the decision-making method (DMM) according to the operator's preferences. The results of proposed Multi-Objective Decision-Support (MODS) model show that the total operation cost and BES sizing have dropped by 68 and 6.1 percent, respectively.

Firstly, this paper establishes a hybrid electric vehicle power system model. Secondly, a hierarchical energy optimization control architecture based on networked information is designed, and a traffic signal timing model is used for vehicle target speed range planning in the upper system. More specifically, the optimal vehicle speed is optimized by a model predictive control algorithm. Thirdly, a mathematical model of vehicle speed variation in connected and unconnected states is established to analyze the effect of vehicle speed planning on fuel economy. Finally, three learning-based energy optimization control strategies, namely Q-learning, deep Q network (DQN), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, are designed under the hierarchical energy optimization control architecture. It is shown that the Q-learning algorithm is able to optimize energy control; however, the agent will meet the ”dimension disaster” once it faces a high-dimensional state space issue.

To solve the above problems, this study provides an optimization solution for entire-trip charging and navigation of EVs, which balances charging resources, protects the travel time of EV drivers, and prioritizes renewable energy. The communication scheme of an EV charging network is designed, including real-time communication between the CSs, EV drivers, road condition monitoring center, power grid company, and the charging control center distributed in every parking lot. CSs in each road segment sort vehicles arriving at stations, allocate charging time slots, provide charging start times, and adjust those times for EVs with reservations that have not yet arrived. EV drivers can plan vehicle charging on their smart devices. The optimization of electric navigation can reduce the travel time or cost for drivers, ensure safe electricity usage, calculate vehicle routes, select CSs, and provide charging time intervals. The effectiveness of the method is verified on a regional road network in China, and the results show that it can balance the charging resource distribution of a CS, guarantee EV state of charge level, greatly reduce travel cost or travel time, provide precise waiting time, and prioritize renewable energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Entire-trip charging navigation; EV-based decentralized optimization; High-speed communication network","Charging (batteries); Condition monitoring; Cost reduction; Electric power system control; Motor transportation; Navigation; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Charging station; Decentralized optimization; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle-based decentralized optimization; Entire-trip charging navigation; High speed communication networks; Renewable energies; Travel-time; Vehicle drivers; Waiting time; Electric vehicles","This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Fundation of China under Grant 52077083 and 52177085 .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149879300"

Besides, EV Charging stations (EVCSs) located in inadequate places exacerbate these issues, causing charging demand to concentrate on a few EVCSs. Therefore, the charging demand estimation for EVCSs and their strategic placement is essential for the system operators and charging station owner. The paper proposes a method for optimal EVCS placement to achieve charging demand dispersion considering not only installation cost but also drivers’ preferences and existing charging stations. To optimally place EVCSs, this work first estimates the charging demand of existing EVCSs based on kernel density estimation. The charging demand for new and existing EVCSs is modeled using the nearest neighbor search to consider drivers’ preference for the nearer station. Next, the EVCS placement problem is formulated to minimize the peak charging demand using integer nonlinear programming, a non-convex problem. To tackle this non-convex problem, a minimax genetic algorithm is proposed, which is genetic algorithm combined with game theory. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulations based on real data from Jeju Island. After applying the proposed method, new EVCS placement is determined by analyzing the tradeoff between the degree of charging demand dispersion and installation cost. As a result, the charging demand concentrated on a particular EVCS is suitably dispersed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Charging station; Electric vehicle; Metaheuristic optimization; Power system planning","Charging (batteries); Dispersion (waves); Dispersions; Electric loads; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Membership functions; Nearest neighbor search; Nonlinear programming; Charging demands; Charging station; EV Charging; Expansion planning; Fast charging stations; Installation costs; Metaheuristic optimization; Nonconvex problem; Penetration rates; Power systems planning; Genetic algorithms; algorithm; electric vehicle; genetic algorithm; heuristics; installation; optimization; penetration; Cheju [Cheju (PRVISL)]","This research was supported in part by the Basic Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the MSIT (No. 2020R1A4A1019405 ) and in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2022R1A2C2011522 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154532119"

Furthermore, exploiting emerging data from distribution networks to provide decision support for adapting planning and operational strategies with system transitions presents a challenge. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel application of digital twins based reinforcement learning to improve decision making by a distribution system operator, with key metrics of predictability, responsiveness, interoperability, and automation. The power system states, i.e., network configurations, technological combinations, and load patterns, are captured via a convolutional neural network, chosen for its pattern recognition capability with high-dimensional inputs. The convolutional neural networks are iteratively trained through the fitted Q-iteration algorithm, as a batch mode reinforcement learning, to adapt the planning and operational decisions with the dynamic system transitions. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by reducing 50% of the investment cost when the system transitions towards the winter and maintaining the power loss and loss of load within 5% compared to the benchmark optimisation. Doubled power consumption was observed in winter under future energy scenarios due to the electrification of heat. The trained model can accurately adapt optimal decisions according to the system changes while reducing the computational time of solving optimisation problems, for a range of scales of distribution systems, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment by a system operator. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Digital twin; Distribution network; Fitted Q-iteration; Load pattern; Network configuration; Reinforcement learning","Convolution; Decision making; Decision support systems; Digital storage; E-learning; Electric loads; Interoperability; Investments; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Reinforcement learning; Convolutional neural network; Distribution systems; Fitted Q-iteration; Load patterns; Network configuration; Network load; Power; Reinforcement learnings; System operator; System transitions; Electric power distribution; decision making; distribution system; electrification; investment; pattern recognition","This work was supported by the EPSRC, UK through the project of “Analytical Middleware for Informed Distribution Networks (AMIDiNe)” ( EP/S030131/1 ).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153237136"

In order to predict the BEVs charging demand, an application that takes into account the random user’s arrival time and the initial battery state of charge (SOC) was developed using the C++ programming language and the Qt toolkit. The network analysis was then carried out using the Quasi-Dynamic Simulation (QDS) toolbox in DIgSILENT PowerFactory on a typical German LV grid for a metropolitan urban area. The simulation findings indicate that the value of simultaneity factor (SF) plays an important role in identifying the most robust and weakest grid’s bottlenecks. There is currently no immediate threat of electromobility pushing the parameters of the grid to their unacceptable limits; however, it is essential to examine the LV grid’s bottlenecks and gradually prepare them for the ramp-up of BEVs. In the short term, the bottlenecks can be removed using conservative planning and operating principles; however, employing novel approaches will be crucial in the longer term. © 2023 by the authors.","charging station; distribution network; electric vehicle; simultaneity factor","C++ (programming language); Charging (batteries); Computer software; Electric lines; Electric loads; Electric vehicles; Secondary batteries; Urban planning; Battery-electric vehicles; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Load hours; Low-voltage grid; Peak load; Power; Simultaneity factor; Urban residential areas; Voltage drop; Electric power distribution","This paper was developed as part of the accompanying scientific research of the project “Electric City Russelsheim: Development of a low-energy charging infrastructure for the city of Rus-selsheim am Main” and thus funded by the “Immediate Clean Air Program 2017–2020” of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action [grants number FKZ: 01MZ18008B].","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166373454"

Therefore, the EV spatial–temporal approach for load mobility forecasting is presented in this article. Furthermore, the reliability indicators of large-scale EV distribution network penetration are analyzed. The Markov decision process (MDP) theory and Monte Carlo simulation are applied to efficiently forecast the charging load and stochastic path planning. A spatial–temporal model is established to robustly forecast the load demand, stochastic path planning, traffic conditions, and temperatures under different scenarios to evaluate the charging load mobility and EV drivers’ behavior. In addition, the distribution network performance indicators are explicitly evaluated. A Monte Carlo simulation is adopted to examine system stability considering various charging scenarios. Urban coupled traffic-distribution networks comprising 30-node transportation and 33-bus distribution networks are considered as a test case to illustrate the proposed study. The results analysis reveals that the proposed method can robustly estimate the charging load mobility.

One of the main problems related to hydrogen FCs is the current weak network of infrastructure’s need to supply the hydrogen itself. An alternative may be the development of FC vehicles powered by methane, or biomethane, to exploit a renewable energy source. The type of Fuel Cells that lends itself to a methane (or biomethane) power supply is the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).

Constraints include harmonic power flow (HPA) equations, operation and power quality limits, and operation model of the IUEE. This scheme has uncertainties of load, energy price, and energy demand of EVs, which are modelled here using stochastic programming.

This paper presents a stochastic bi-level model for the optimal allocation of fast charging stations (FCSs) and distribution network expansion planning (DNEP). First, a sequential capacitated flow-capturing location-allocation model (SCFCLM) is proposed at the lower level to optimize the allocation of FCSs on the transportation network. Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) is utilized to estimate daily charging load requirements. Then, we propose an economic model for DNEP at the upper level, and the chance constrained method is employed to relax power flow constraints to address the uncertainties of loads. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the proposed planning method. The influences of the flow capturing sequence and relaxed confidence level on the PEV charging load, FCS planning strategies and DNEP schemes are analyzed. © 2015 CSEE.","Coordinated planning; fast charging station; flow-capturing model; plug-in electric vehicle; stochastic bi-level model","Charging (batteries); Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Numerical methods; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Bi-level models; Charging loads; Coordinated planning; Distribution network expansion planning; Fast charging stations; Flow-capturing model; Location modeling; Network-based; Stochastic bi-level model; Stochastics; Plug-in electric vehicles","This work is supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation China (No. 51877181) and in part by the Innovation Fund of Postgraduate, Xihua University (No. YCJJ2020050).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159165599"

Accordingly, metaheuristics – top-level algorithms inspired by various natural and physical processes – can be utilised to determine the near optimality in designing MGs. However, a comprehensive review of the mainstream literature has shown that the performance of several metaheuristics has not yet been evaluated. In response, this paper first systematically benchmarks the efficiencies of previously unexplored metaheuristics in MG sizing applications against the well-established metaheuristic in the literature, namely the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. To this end, the metaheuristics are separately integrated into a novel MG sizing method, which is aware of the optimal demand response capacity procured from electric vehicle (EV)-charging loads. Two grid-independent, 100%-renewable MGs are modelled, which enable the reliable and robust supply of electrical loads in areas far removed from the grid. Furthermore, an advanced EV-charging demand response program is integrated into the overall method, whilst quantifying various sources of time-series data uncertainty and considering specific resilience constraints. The simulation results yielded from three real-world isolated community case studies in Aotearoa-New Zealand confirm the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic, resilience-oriented, EV-charging demand response-addressable MG sizing method. Importantly, the comprehensive statistics-based performance evaluations indicate that new metaheuristics have the potential to outperform the PSO by up to ∼6% in MG sizing applications. This indicates the potentially significant implications of using advanced metaheuristics for improving the economics – and, therefore, rolling out – capital-intensive grid-isolated 100%-renewable MGs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Metaheuristics; Microgrids; Optimal sizing; Renewable energy sources; Resilience","Benchmarking; Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric vehicles; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Polynomial approximation; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Charging demands; Demand response; Electric vehicle charging; Metaheuristic; Microgrid; Off-grids; Optimal sizing; Renewable energy source; Resilience; Stochastics; Heuristic algorithms; alternative energy; comparative study; demand analysis; electric vehicle; performance assessment; simulation; smart grid; stochasticity; New Zealand","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153068486"

The OSB is considered to support the grid under fast charging loads. By the proposed approach, the impact of operational planning on reliability is identified. The main operational parameters considered in the reliability analysis include the charging load power and the charging- and discharging scheduling of the OSB. A hierarchical reliability framework is established where the failure rates of the components are estimated based on the FIDES methodology for physics-of-failure-based reliability prediction. Then, a dynamic failure threshold is introduced to translate the component failure consequences to the system performance into three states - failed, normal, and de-rated operation. Hence, the failure threshold is obtained for a specific set of operational and system design parameters. Additionally, to benchmark the characteristics of the SoC profiles of the OSB, an operation-based battery lifetime analysis is conducted. The evaluation of system-level reliability and on-shore battery lifetime is carried out for a 4MW dc S2SC system with a specified range of operation parameters. The results show that batteries and the IGBTs in the power electronics converters are the most reliability-critical elements. Moreover, it is apparent from the results that adjustments to the OSB power profile planning can potentially improve the reliability of the system for specific system sizing. It is also found that the OSB lifetime can be extended up to 2.5 times by increasing the capacity by 50% and keeping the SoC close to around 50%. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Battery-electric ship; marine electrification; reliability assessment; shipboard power systems; shore-to-ship charging","Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric vehicles; Failure analysis; Outages; Reliability analysis; Secondary batteries; Ships; Battery; Battery-electric ship; Electric ships; Marine electrification; Marine vehicles; Power systems reliability; Power-electronics; Reliability (engineering); Reliability assessments; Shipboard power system; Shore-to-ship charging; Power electronics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151525698"

To accommodate the increasing number of EVs, the co-planning of electrical distribution networks and the charging infrastructure, such as fast-charging stations (FCSs), becomes an emergent task. Both the charging demand of EVs and the stability of the electricity network should be satisfied. In this paper, we proposed a data-driven agent-based planning strategy for FCSs. Different from the conventional planning strategy, we utilized machine learning tools to consider EV behaviors at the microscopic level in a planning problem. First, a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process of EVs is established, and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is utilized to learn the charging and driving decisions of EVs under different transportation network typologies and FCSs planning schemes. Second, a data-driven agent-based traffic assignment model (DA-TAM) is proposed to aggregate the atomic behaviors of EVs, which can present the sensitivity of the traffic flow and EV charging demand to the FCS planning schemes. Third, the DA-TAM is adapted to the proposed planning model to ensure the quality of service and prevent unbalanced traffic flow. Through the proposed method, microscopic behaviors of EVs can be reflected, and the impact of the planning scheme on the traffic condition can be revealed. The proposed methodologies are verified in the case studies. The presented agent-based planning strategy can serve more EV charging demands, cause less waiting time in FCSs to enhance the quality of service, and encounter less severe traffic unbalance problems. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Fast charging station; Markov decision process; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; traffic assignment model","Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Deep learning; Electric loads; Electric vehicles; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Multi agent systems; Power quality; Quality of service; Agent based; Behavioral science; Electric vehicle charging; Fast charging stations; Load modeling; Markov Decision Processes; Multi agent; Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Traffic assignment models; Reinforcement learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146256610"

It is expected that a range of grid transportation solutions that complement one another and considerable transmission infrastructure changes will be needed to achieve this goal. Strategic planning and control, including economic models and strategies to engage and reward users, can reduce energy loss on the power network. This would eliminate grid upgrades. Bidirectional charging of EVs can help transmission systems cope with EV allocation. Power loss and voltage instability are the transmission network’s biggest issues. Adding EV units to the transmission network usually solves these problems. Therefore, EVs need the right layout and proportions. This study determined where and how many radial transmission network EVs there should be before and after the adjustment. To discover the best EV position and size before and after the dial network modification, a hybrid genetic algorithm for particle swarm optimization (HGAIPSO) was utilized. Electric vehicles coordinated in an active transmission network reduce power losses, raise voltage profiles, and improve system stability. Electric vehicles are responsible for these benefits. The simulation showed that adding EVs to the testing system reduced power waste. The system’s minimum bus voltage likewise increased. The proposed technology reduced transmission system voltage fluctuations and power losses, according to the comparison analysis. The IEEE-30 bus test system reduced real power loss by 40.70%, 36.24%, and 42.94% for the type A, type B, and type C EV allocations, respectively.

The impact was studied from a reliability perspective on Saudi Arabia’s total generation system capacity as one source supplying the expected load for the year 2030. The EV load profile was then added. The outcomes were examined considering the gradual penetration percentage to the total load. The reliability indices measured are the loss of load probability (LOLP) and the expected energy not supplied (EENS). The results show that the estimated generation system of Saudi Vision 2030 will not withstand the estimated number of EVs without negatively impacting reliability. Similarly, the reliability assessment was conducted for the central region considering EVs in Riyadh City to verify Saudi Vision 2030. The results show that EV integration will greatly affect the electrical network’s reliability. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for Saudi Arabia and the central region to assess the generation system better. The study shows that investing in the generation infrastructure is essential to handle EV growth for the upcoming years. The work introduced in this paper will also help decision-makers make appropriate planning decisions in the future. © 2023 by the authors.","EENS; EVs; LOLP; Reliability; Riyadh City; Saudi Arabia; Saudi Vision 2030","Decision making; Electric loads; Electric losses; Sensitivity analysis; Electric vehicle integrations; Expected energy not supplied; Generation systems; Load profiles; Loss-of-load probabilities; Power; Riyadh city; Saudi Arabia; Saudi vision 2030; System Capacity; Reliability","The authors would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research at Umm Al-Qura University for supporting this work by Grant Code: (23UQU44380238DSR001).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163875259"

Therefore, it is crucial to predetermine a maximum loadability limit for voltage collapse analysis and a practical allowable extra load for safe and secure operation, keeping the bus voltage within the security limits. To mitigate the problems, unique and innovative formulae such as the maximum load multiplier (MLM) and practical load multiplier (PLM) have been developed to consider line resistance. The determination of actual permissible extra load for a bus enables quick assessment of bus-wise suitable capacities and the number of EVs that can be charged simultaneously in the charging station. The planning engineers can easily settle on the extra load demand by domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers, while maintaining the voltage security constraint. The proposed technique is simple, non-iterative, computationally inexpensive, and applicable to both transmission and distribution systems. The proposed work is tested on a 57-bus transmission system and 69-bus radial distribution system, and the obtained results from the developed formulae are verified by comparing with conventional iterative methods. © 2023 by the authors.","maximum load multiplier; non-iterative unique logical formula; practical load multiplier; transmission and distribution systems; voltage limit","Commercial vehicles; Electric loads; Electric losses; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission; Vehicle transmissions; Load multipliers; Logical formulas; Maximum load; Maximum load multiplier; Non-iterative; Non-iterative unique logical formula; Practical load multiplier; Transmission and distribution systems; Voltage limits; Iterative methods","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163843877"

First, based on the load density method and occupancy rate to predict the base electricity load in the community, the Bass model and charging probability are used to predict the community’s electric vehicle charging load. Taking the minimum annual construction and operation costs of the community distribution network as the objective function, the power supply topology of the distribution network for a new community is optimized by using Prim and single-parent genetic algorithms.

It allows for accomplishing electricity requirements in periods of high demand and additional storage in case of surplus generation from the grid. Electric vehicles also earn reward points for energy trading. The significant trading data volume processed by the underlying Vehicle-to-Grid infrastructure results in numerous security, privacy and scalability challenges. Researchers suggested various energy trading schemes but suffered from anonymity, large overheads, and dependency on a centralized system, which may cause single-point failure. As a solution, new design principles are desirable to enable the next generation of Vehicle-to-Grid networks. Decentralized energy information networks are a crucial aspect of future power grids, and blockchain technology offers promising potential to support local energy trading and decentralized power generation. Thus, a proposed framework uses the blockchain-based decentralized, secure, and privacy vehicle-to-grid network mutual authentication and energy trading system using elliptic curve cryptography with a scheduling feature. The Proposed scheme is divided into four steps (1) Registration, (2) Scheduling, (3) Mutual authentication and (4) Consensus and energy trading. Distributed ledger blockchain technology makes every transaction valid and authentic, possibly minimizing or eliminating mediators in energy trading, while lightweight elliptical curve cryptography is used for mutual authentication. Further, the performance of our scheme is justified by using the popular AVISPA simulation tool.

Microgrids appear to be the solution for large-scale renewable energy integration in these sectors. The microgrid components must be optimally planned and operated to prevent high costs, technical issues, and emissions. Existing approaches for optimal microgrid planning and operation in the literature do not include a solution for e-mobility infrastructure development. Consequently, the authors provide a compact new methodology that considers the placement and the stochastic evolution of e-mobility infrastructure. In this new methodology, a retropolation approach to forecast the rise in the number of electric vehicles, a monte-carlo simulation for electric vehicle (EV) charging behaviors, a method for the definition of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) numbers based on occupancy time, and public EVCS placement based on monte-carlo simulation have been developed. A deterministic optimization strategy for the planning and operation of microgrids is created using the abovementioned methodologies, which additionally consider technical power system issues. As the future development of e-mobility infrastructure has high associated uncertainties, a new stochastic method referred to as the information gap decision method (IGDM) is proposed. This method provides a risk-averse strategy for microgrid planning and operation by including long-term uncertainty related to e-mobility. Finally, the deterministic and stochastic methodologies are combined in a novel holistic approach for microgrid design and operation in terms of cost, emission, and robustness. The proposed method has been tested in a new settlement area in Magdeburg, Germany, under three different EV development scenarios (negative, trend, and positive). EVs are expected to reach 31 percent of the total number of cars in the investigated settlement area. Due to this, three public electric vehicle charging stations will be required in the 2031 trend scenario. Thus, the investigated settlement area requires a total cost of 127,029 €. In association with possible uncertainties, the cost of the microgrid must be raised by 80 percent to gain complete robustness against long-term risks in the development of EVCS. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","E-mobility infrastructure; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging station; Holistic approach; Information gap decision method; Monte-Carlo simulation; Optimizations; Sector coupling","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Charging station; Decision method; E mobilities; E-mobility infrastructure; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Holistic approach; Information gap decision method; Information-gap; Mobility infrastructure; Monte Carlo's simulation; Optimisations; Sector coupling; Optimization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161342936"

This paper sought an optimal coordinated generation scheduling for day-ahead power system operation considering RESs and energy storage units. Renewable power generation, particularly, wind and photovoltaic are uncontrollable, whereas can be predicted using forecasting models. Within the proposed framework, a hyperparameter-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) regression model is employed to forecast the day-ahead weather from the historical time-series weather data. Eventually, an empirical formula is used to estimate the power conversion from the day-ahead weather forecasts for a selected PV module and wind turbine. The objective of the scheduling framework is to keep a delicate supply-demand balance at the lowest possible cost of generation while maintaining the prevailing generation and system constraints. A variance measure uncertainty handling-based grey wolf optimizer (GWO) technique is used to find the optimal day-ahead generation schedules and dispatches under RESs forecast uncertainty. The proposed generation scheduling framework is examined on the IEEE 6 and 30-bus systems. In the studied scenarios, the coordinated operation of generators can decrease the total day-ahead operating cost for the modified IEEE 6-bus system by 2.57% compared to supplying electricity generation with conventional generators alone. Likewise, the total operating cost from the coordinated operation of all generation portfolios was reduced by 6.93% from the operating cost of generation during base case simulation (supply only from dispatchable thermal units) on the modified IEEE 30-bus system. Moreover, the case studies show that coordinated generation scheduling can mitigate the RESs power variability problem, provide secure supply-demand operation, and minimize the operating cost of electricity generation. © 2023 The Authors.

Therefore, the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) requires reliable fast-charging stations (FCSs). However, random allocation of FCSs and PV adversely impacts the performance and operation of the traffic flow and power networks. Thus, this paper proposes a new planning approach for the optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs in large-scale smart grids and transportation networks. Unlike existing approaches, the well-known Dynamic Network Assignment Simulation for Road Telematics (DYNASMART) is updated and employed in the proposed planning approach to accurately simulate the EVs within the traffic stream. The average waiting time of the EVs at the charging stations (including charging time) and the total annual costs are utilized as conflicting objective functions to be minimized. To effectively solve this comprehensive model with conflicting objectives, a bi-layer multiobjective optimization based on metaheuristic (NSGA-II) and deterministic (GAMS) algorithms is established. The outer layer optimizes the allocation of FCSs and PV accurately, while the inner one optimally dispatches the generated power of the conventional generation units. The proposed planning approach is tested on a 26-bus electrical transmission network and 92-node transportation system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs with 80% EVs penetration increases the net profit by 85.36% while maintaining a maximum of 30 minutes for both charging and waiting time. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Fast-charging stations; Multiobjective optimization; Photovoltaics; Transmission systems","Charging (batteries); Electric load dispatching; Electric network parameters; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging time; Conflicting objectives; Fast charging stations; Generation dispatch; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimal allocation; Photovoltaics; Smart grid; Transmission systems; Transportation electrifications; Multiobjective optimization","This publication was made possible by grant # FRG19-L-E73 from the American University of Sharjah .

A careful coordination of the grid operations and charging schedules is needed to alleviate these challenges, and turn them into opportunities. For this purpose, we study the Multi-Period Optimal Power Flow problem (MOPF) with electric vehicles under emission considerations. We integrate three different real-world datasets: household electricity consumption, marginal emission factors, and EV driving profiles. We present a systematic solution approach based on second-order cone programming to find globally optimal solutions for the resulting nonconvex optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose such a comprehensive model integrating multiple real datasets and a promising solution method for the EV-aware MOPF Problem. Our computational experiments on various instances with up to 2000 buses demonstrate that our solution approach leads to high-quality feasible solutions with provably small optimality gaps. In addition, we show the importance of coordinated EV charging to achieve significant emission savings and reductions in cost.

Due to insulation degradations, this issue ends in transformers’ loss of life (LOL) and early aging. The notion of cloud energy storage system (CESS) with larger power and energy capacities enables consumers to have access to cheaper energy storage facilities. Thanks to CESS installation, semi-smart, controlled, and low-cost charging of PHEVs could be realized to relieve the transformer's peak loads and reduce the peak-to-average (PAR) ratio of load curve. To do so, this paper develops an optimal planning model for siting and sizing of a CESS to accommodate the charge/discharge requirements of consumers who are willing to collaborate with CESS and hence, implementing a controlled charging of PHEVs. The proposed model considers the investment and operation costs of both CESS and distribution network. It also models the transformer LOL costs. The PHEVs, in private garages, are supposed to be connected to the grid through a smart module whose connection time and status is optimally scheduled and controlled through the operator of the CESS. The CESS charging/discharging is regulated such that the previously determined time targets of PHEV owners are satisfied. To assess performance of the proposed model, extensive numerical studies are carried out in terms of techno-economic indices say as PAR reduction, conducting energy arbitrage, power losses reduction, and etc. Results are discussed in depth. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud energy storage system (CESS); Optimal siting and sizing; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV); Semi-smart charging of PHEVs; Transformer loss of life (LOL)","Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric loads; Electric losses; Electric power distribution; Electric transformers; Investments; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Voltage distribution measurement; Cloud energy storage system; Optimal siting and sizing; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Semi-smart charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle; Siting and sizings; Smart charging; Storage systems; Transformer loss of life; Transformer loss of lives; Energy storage","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158161476"

The primary motivation is to find the optimal sizing and siting of NWAs while considering WAs such that the ADN's dynamically growing electrical load and EV demand are met while maintaining network limits. Given the flexibility of NWA resources, they can provide the support needed to the ADN (e.g., congestion relief and voltage support) while providing ASs to the grid. The proposed model is posed as a mixed-integer linear program to maximize the overall profits of the DSO. WAs considered include adding/upgrading lines and upgrading the substation by installing transformers, while NWAs include sizing and siting of distributed RESs, TGs, and BESSs with considering EVCSs supply the EVs. Simulation results demonstrate the financial benefits of simultaneously considering WAs and NWAs. They also verify the feasibility of having the DSO participate in the ASs market utilizing its flexible resources.

Therefore, accurate spatial–temporal distribution prediction of EV charging load is vital for both power system and coupled power-transportation system studies. This paper proposes a novel method based on stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) for predicting the accurate spatial–temporal distribution of EV charging load synchronized with traffic states. A prediction framework of EV charging load based on SUE and trip chain is proposed, which can effectively reflect the actual behavior of EVs in synchronous traffic states. Then, the extended logit-based SUE and equivalent mathematical model are proposed to obtain more detailed traffic states with intersection turning flows and delays. Meanwhile, the unified reachability and charging models are established to ensure that the trip chain is reachable and the charging characteristics are suitable for different EV types. Finally, the method of the successive averages (MSA) and the Dijkstra-based K-shortest paths algorithms are integrated to solve the proposed framework iteratively with stable convergence. Test results on a realistic traffic network show that the proposed method can effectively reflect the charging and trip characteristics of different EV types while ensuring reachability. And it can also accurately predict the overall and individual EV travel costs and total charging loads in detailed synchronous traffic states. In particular, even in the case of high EV penetration with higher peak-to-valley differences and charging demand, the convergence of the prediction is still stable with even more remarkable prediction effectiveness, especially during peak load hours. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis based on proposed criticality indexes reveals that traffic network failures will affect the network-wide traffic states and EV charging loads with different node-level impact characteristics, which should be considered in joint power-transportation restoration scheduling. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Intersection delay; Spatial-temporal distribution; Stochastic user equilibrium","Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric power system planning; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Spatial distribution; Stochastic systems; Charging loads; Electric vehicle charging; Intersection delays; Power; Reachability; Spatial-temporal distribution; Stochastic user equilibrium; Traffic state; Transportation system; Trip chains; Electric vehicles; algorithm; electric vehicle; electricity; energy planning; quantitative analysis; stochasticity","This work was funded in part by the National Key R&D Program of China ( 2020YFB0905900 ), and in part by science and technology project of SGCC (State Grid Corporation of China): The key technologies for electric internet of things ( SGTJDK00DWJS2100223 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150286256"

In this context, a multistage low-carbon EV CFs planning model is proposed in this paper for the coupled transportation and power systems. This model not only takes into account the construction costs of newly-built CFs and their adverse impacts on the distribution system, but also considers the carbon emissions of CFs and the penalty due to the inconvenience for EVs to be recharged. In addition, a rational travel route choice model is significantly important to accurately evaluate the service capability of CFs to be constructed and thereby to obtain an optimal CF planning result. Therefore, a novel travel route choice model developed in this work allows EV drivers to take detours according to the CF locations to charge their EVs multiple times and then finish their trips. Carbon emission flow (CEF) model is innovatively employed to precisely calculate CFs' carbon emission amount from the perspective of consumption side. Subsequently, uncertainties involved in CF planning, i.e., distribution and growth rate of traffic flow and electric load, popularity of different types of EVs, as well as location of the connected node of clean electricity, are fully considered to obtain a robust CF planning scheme that can achieve a good performance in the current stage and exhibit robustness for the uncertainties in the future stage. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The impacts of future carbon price and EV cruising range on the planning results are also comprehensively evaluated. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Carbon emission flow; charging facility; coupled transportation and power system; robust planning","Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; Transportation routes; Carbon emission flows; Charging facilities; Coupled transportation and power system; Electric vehicle charging; Facilities planning; Power; Robust planning; Route choice model; Travel route choices; Uncertainty; Carbon dioxide","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 72271068, Grant 72171155, Grant 72001058, and Grant 51907126; in part by the Foundations of Shenzhen and Technology Committee under Grant GJHZ20210705141811036, Grant GXWD20220811151845006, Grant JCYJ20200109105204077, and Grant GXWD20201230155427003- 20200822103658001; in part by the General Program of Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under Grant 2023A1515010724; in part by the Major Science and Technology Special Projects in Xinjiang Autonomous Region under Grant 2022A01007; and in part by the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Key Research and Development Task Special Project under Grant 2022B01016.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149402162"

This necessitates the identification of potential solutions that can restrict high Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF). Electric vehicles (EVs), due to their fast response capability and instantaneous power delivery, are a viable source for the Fast Frequency Response (FFR) service. Potential assessment of EVs for FFR service is required to restrict high RoCoF and maintain secure and reliable system operation in real-time. The main contribution of this work is to assess the potential of EVs for FFR support through both Grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) modes.

An electric vehicle charging navigation strategy that takes into account the idle rate and dynamic tariff is proposed in this paper, which improves the load characteristics and reduce traffic congestion. Firstly, the electric vehicle charging navigation model with the integration of “four networks and four flows” is established. The interaction effect between the charging demand of electric vehicle users and the information network, traffic network, power grid is analyzed. Secondly, the multi-dimensional spatial and temporal characteristics of the empty-loading ratio of the electric taxi are studied. The optimal charging period for electric vehicle users is determined by the intelligent charging navigation terminal based on real-time road condition information. The path planning is carried out with the goal of minimizing the comprehensive cost of charging time and dynamic charging cost, and the electric taxi is guided to the optimal charging station to achieve orderly charging in space. Finally, taking the coupling system of traffic network and power grid in an urban area as an example, the proposed strategy is simulated and analyzed. The results show that this strategy can effectively balance the load of each charging station, improve the load characteristics of distribution network, which can effectively divert traffic flow, alleviate traffic congestion, and improve the operating income of electric taxi. © 2022","Charging navigation; Dynamic electricity price; Empty-loading ratio; Spatial and temporal characteristics","Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Information services; Loading; Motion planning; Navigation; Taxicabs; Urban planning; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging navigation; Dynamic electricity price; Electricity prices; Empty-loading ratio; Loading ratio; Navigation strategies; Power grids; Spatial characteristics; Temporal characteristics; Vehicle users; Traffic congestion","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 6187023566 ]; Colleges and Universities in Hebei Province Science and Technology Research Project [grant number ZD2020129 ].","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146436025"

The uncertainties of EV availability (arrival and departure times) and its initial state of charge, when arrives home, are incorporated using stochastic functions. The effect of popular EV models in the market is investigated on the optimal sizing and electricity cost of the customers.

The first stage determines the locations and sizes of the DGs with locations of EVCSs in grid-connected scenario, whereas the second stage planning identifies the optimal islands under the islanded microgrid scenario. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is applied to solve the first stage planning problem; in this stage, the algorithm minimizes two objective functions: the system-losses and total cost. In the second stage, another single objective optimization problem is designed which minimizes supply voltage variations to find optimal islands for the DGs and EVCSs to ensure a secure supply of power for EVs. The proposed framework is implemented on the IEEE 33-bus system and verified with four test cases.

This study aimed to assess the energy transition of an island towards a 100% renewable energy system for power generation, inland transport, and potable water provision. Linking various fossil-fuel-consuming sectors, such as transport and potable water supply systems, may strongly assist in reducing the possible mismatch between renewable energy source production and demand and contribute to fulfilling other system requirements. The use of energy storage technologies is vital and unlike traditional power systems; as the number of components in the system increases, their proper capacity needs to be accurately determined. This work employs a multi-objective optimization assessment using a modified NSGA-II algorithm to depict the energy transition for Porto Santo Island. To evaluate the solutions, we considered the main criteria of energy cost, avoided environmental impacts (CO<inf>2</inf>-equivalent emissions) of the proposed system, and loss of power supply. The Pareto front contains various solutions under different system configurations. Results indicate that full inland transport electrification (introducing 3000 EVs) can account for 18% of the avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the island while sharing 28–40% of the up-front cost of the system, depending on the proposed system’s components. The EV’s costs incorporate subsidies and their battery replacement. Another interesting finding from the optimization process is that the solution with the highest avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions involves keeping a diesel generator for supplying 4% of the island’s total demand and using an underwater compressed air energy storage with a capacity of 280 MWh.

The approach involves optimising the system under multi-physical constraints, where the number of cells in the interleaved converters is considered as a key modular parameter. The methodology uses analytical models to strike a balance between computation time and result accuracy. This compromise is indispensable to the construction of a smart design approach under multi-physical constraints, such as electric, efficiency, volume, and thermal constraints. The proposed approach has been applied to a hybrid fuel cell and battery power system for automotive applications; the goal is to obtain a global optimal architecture chain by optimising the number of interleaved converter cells and by determining appropriate power electronics components and the optimal sizing of sources. This constitutes the primary step for providing an effective pre-design support tool for considering architecture modularity, facilitating the use of new technologies in the early design stage. The results showed that the interleaving concept allows for better flexibility in respecting the design constraints to improve the design of hybrid power systems. The analysis also highlights the current limitations and performance of the optimisation method and suggests new areas for future work. © 2023 by the authors.","conception approach; fuel cell electric vehicle; interleaved converters; modular architecture; multi-physical optimisation","Secondary batteries; Conception approach; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Hybrid power; Interleaved converters; Modular architectures; Modulars; Multi-physical optimization; Optimisations; Physical constraints; Pre-sizing; Fuel cells","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160603678"

However, the electric power distribution networks are congested, which lowers the accommodation of PEVs and produces higher power losses. Therefore, the study proposes an effective deterministic methodology to maximize the accommodation of PEVs and percentage power loss reduction (%PLR) in radial distribution networks (RDNs). In the first stage, the PEVs are allocated to the best bus, which is chosen based on the loading capacity to power loss index (LCPLI), and the accommodation profile of PEVs is developed based on varying states of charge (SoC) and battery capacities (BCs). In the second stage, the power losses are minimized in PEV integrated networks with the allocation of DG units using a recently developed parallel-operated arithmetic optimization algorithm salp swarm algorithm (AOASSA). In the third stage, the charging and discharging ratios of PEVs are optimized analytically to minimize power losses after planning PEVs and DGs. The outcomes reveal that bus-2 is the most optimal bus for accommodation of PEVs, as it has the highest level of LCPLI, which is 9.81 in the 33-bus system and 28.24 in the 69-bus system. The optimal bus can safely accommodate the largest number of electric vehicles, with a capacity of 31,988 units in the 33-bus system and 92,519 units in the 69-bus system. Additionally, the parallel-operated AOASSA mechanism leads to a reduction in power losses of at least 0.09% and 0.25% compared with other algorithms that have been previously applied to the 33-bus and 69-bus systems, respectively. Moreover, with an optimal charging and discharging ratio of PEVs in the IEEE-33-bus radial distribution network (RDN), the %PLR further improved by 3.08%, 4.19%, and 2.29% in the presence of the optimal allocation of one, two and three DG units, respectively. In the IEEE-69-bus RDN, the %PLR further improved by 0.09%, 0.09%, and 0.08% with optimal charge and discharge ratios in the presence of one, two, and three DG units, respectively.

The aim of implementing these techniques is to optimize allocation of renewable energy distributed generation (RE-DG) for reducing active power losses, reactive power losses, and total voltage deviation, and to improve the voltage stability index in radial distribution networks (RDNs).

Integrating photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) with fast charging station (FCS) can alleviate the negative impacts and bring benefits to both power system operation and charging service provider. In this paper, an integrated procedure is proposed for the charging service provider to optimally plan fast charging stations integrated with PV and ESS in urban area, while taking the influence of its competitors, EV users' decision-making psychology, the uncertainties of charging demand and PV power output into consideration. Firstly, a charging demand estimation method based on average travel speed is presented. Secondly, a stochastic dynamic user choice equilibrium (SDUCE) model and its solution algorithm based on method of successive averages (MSA) are proposed. The model considers the key factors influencing the charging decision of EV users as well as the uncertainty of their perceptions of utility values. In addition, the time-varying queuing time and the temporal coupling among EVs arriving at a charging station in different time periods are also considered. Thirdly, based on the equilibrium model, a multi-scenario benefit maximization model is built from the perspective of charging service provider, and solved by genetic algorithm. Finally, a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) planning model based on the Wasserstein-metric is formulated to determine the capacities of PV and ESS.

This paper proposes a collaborative planning method for low-carbon DES with networks, which is focusing on the characteristics of EV charging behavior. First of all, based on the quantitative analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of charging load of four typical types of EV, including private vehicle, public vehicle, taxi and bus, the Monte Carlo method is used to construct the charging load modeling of EV in the region area. In addition, the low-carbon DES is modeled equipped with photovoltaic (PV) and power to gas (P2G) devices, and the Prim algorithm is adopted to search for the optimal network layout of energy transmission pipelines in the region area. Under carbon trading mechanism, aiming at the lowest annualized total cost of the regional station-network, a station-network collaborative planning modeling strategy for the capacity allocation of low-carbon DES with networks is established. Finally, the case study for a project in Beijing China is implemented on MATLAB, to prove the effectiveness of the method proposed in the paper. The time-of-use electricity price scheme changes the temporal and spatial characteristics of EV load. For example, more than 2 MW the EV load can be brought into the valley price range, which reduces the carbon transaction cost and energy purchase cost of DES by 50 thousand yuan almost when peak-valley electricity price difference is close to 1.2 yuan.

Operating a mobile charging service system involves scheduling mobile charging vehicles (MCVs) and batteries owned by the mobile charging service operator (MCSO), which is important to improve its economic efficiency and has a nonnegligible impact on the power system. In this paper, a bilevel optimization framework for logistics and electricity is developed for MCSOs to achieve joint optimization of planning and operation of the mobile charging service system. For transportation logistics, the upper level plans the size of the MCV fleet and routes MCVs in the dynamic traffic network, which can accommodate dynamic changes in the traffic network and make a reasonable route arrangement. For battery energy management, the lower level plans the battery number and optimizes battery charging and discharging at energy service stations, which can track the electric quantity and the state of each battery during the whole process and accurately describe the matching relationship between batteries in a battery swapping scenario. The upper and lower levels are coupled through the battery swapping behavior between MCVs and energy service stations. Through the iteration and adjustment of the two levels, the results optimize the MCSO's total net profit as much as possible and provide assistance to the power system using service capacity margins.

Also, the operation centers for fuel-cell electric buses can be upgraded as the hydrogen-based microgrids to achieve higher economic benefits and resilience levels. To support the low-carbon and resilience-oriented planning of microgrid-aided bus centers, this paper presents a two-stage robust optimization formulation with integer corrective decisions. In particular, the first-stage problem is to optimize the microgrid siting decisions as well as the capacity configuration of renewable-powered electrolyzers, fuel-cell stacks and hydrogen refueling stations for maximizing the annualized benefits. Then, a min–max problem is introduced in the second-stage to improve the load survival value subject to the planning decisions and the worst-case contingency scenario. Also, various corrective actions, e.g., the emergency response of fuel-cell electric buses using vehicle-to-grid functionality, the energy scheduling of stationary equipment in hydrogen refueling stations and the adaptive network reconfiguration, are considered for resilience enhancement of the local power network. As the resulting robust optimization formulation is with a challenging mixed-integer recourse structure, the nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is designed. Numerical results on exemplary power network and public transportation system validate the effectiveness of the proposed planning methodology, which has the potential to be profitable under normal operations while improving the load survivability under severe disastrous occasions.

Uncontrolled renewable energy generation and storage, and EV charging can cause over/under voltage problems. Recently, there has been much effort, from control and scheduling of BESSs and EVs to PV curtailment, to address these issues. However, the knowledge about how much penetration of these technologies can be well-tolerated by the grid when all charging/discharging are uncontrolled, would still be of interest to DNOs. There are many depending factors such as customer consumption profiles, grid conditions and network constraints. In this paper, we propose a framework to determine the critical balance between PV, BESS and EV in a distribution grid. Using real data from 4000 customers in Victoria, Australia, we find that in the absence of advanced control and scheduling algorithms, the best approach to prevent voltage violation in the grid is to keep the installation of PV and BESS balanced with the EV penetration. We also show that power export to the grid by EVs using the vehicle-to-home (V2H) technology may contribute to keeping the grid voltage in the standard range if 40%–80% of EVs are in the discharge mode in critical peak times. While complete coordination of PV, EV and BESS has not yet been fully realized in many networks, our methodology provides a framework for DNOs to perform optimised planning. © 2023","Electric vehicles; Household battery energy storage system; Overvoltage; Photovoltaics; Power distribution networks","Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric discharges; Electric network analysis; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling algorithms; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery energy storage systems; Case-studies; Distribution grid; Distribution network operators; Household battery energy storage system; Over-voltages; Photovoltaic solar systems; Photovoltaics; Power distribution network; Renewable energy storages; Battery storage; algorithm; electric vehicle; energy storage; equipment; photovoltaic system; Australia; Victoria [Australia]","This work is supported by the Australian Research Council through the project no LP180101309 , and by the Victorian Government through Victorian Higher Education State Investment Fund.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149071109"

One of the key challenges facing power companies operating within this context is effectively planning power production across multiple production technologies. To address this challenge, this study employs fuzzy set theory and proposes a combinatorial optimisation approach for the problem of power generation planning. The planning process is considered as a multi-period optimisation task where uncertain factors in each period are considered as fuzzy variables. The credibility expected value and the lower semi-variance in the final production value are considered as the return and risk objectives of the problem, respectively. Then, a bi-objective optimisation model with complex constraints under the influence of political factors is proposed. A hybrid intelligent algorithm based on fuzzy simulation, artificial neural network and multi-objective genetic algorithm is developed to solve the model. A numerical example in the Chinese energy market is tested to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results highlight seasonal variation in the profits and risks of each production technology. From a practical perspective, the proposed approach can help decision-makers to establish multi-period production planning. Additionally, this study analyses the optimal production planning for companies under different levels of renewable energy and carbon emission standards. The results show that the proposed approach can reflect the influence of these policy factors on utilities’ production decisions, which provides certain guidance for regulators to formulate appropriate policies. © 2023 The Author(s)","Combinatorial optimisation; Energy policy factor; Fuzzy set theory; Hybrid intelligent approach; Power generation planning; Renewable energy","Decision making; Electric power system planning; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Genetic algorithms; Power generation; Production control; Renewable energy resources; Energy policy factor; Fuzzy-set theory; Hybrid intelligent approach; Multi-period; Policy factors; Power company; Power generation planning; Production Planning; Production technology; Renewable energies; Combinatorial optimization","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 9222002 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72140001 ) and National Social Science Fund Major Project ( 22&ZD145 ).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147700281"

Therefore, distribution utilities must carry out anticipated operational planning to achieve appropriate and efficient network management. Then, it is necessary to obtain more accurate load forecasts on higher granularity levels than those commonly supervised by the SCADA system, for instance, at distribution transformers. Furthermore, as medium/low voltage profiles are more volatile and uncertain than high voltage profiles and, therefore, more difficult to predict, there is an opportunity to improve their performance at this level. This work proposes a short-term net load forecast model that considers load consumption and PV distributed generation behind the meter. This model is based on an efficient deep learning network that uses novel techniques and architectures implemented in other tasks adapted to the net electric load forecasting problem at an individual and/or low-aggregated level. At the same time, the model can consider information provided by exogenous variables of time and meteorological ones to improve the forecast accuracy. Additionally, the proposed model is extended to a probabilistic approach through Monte Carlo Dropout and kernel density estimation to obtain probability density forecasts. To evaluate the model performance, a dataset from the “Caucete Smart Grid” located in Argentina is used.

The first part of this study presents the design and sizing of a battery energy storage system (BESS), made from retired LIBs, to store a portion of the PV generation for a typical home in Ohio. The home is connected to the grid, but the net electricity usage from the grid in one year is zero. The purpose of the BESS is to peak shaving, power arbitrage, reduce the home dependency on the grid, and increase the economic benefits. The sizing is determined based on the hourly data of the PV system generation, ambient temperature, irradiation, and home demand electricity. In the second part of this study, the retired LIB degradation rate and its remaining useful life in the BESS are estimated using an adopted empirical LIB model. The model includes the capacity-fade for both first-life and second-life of the LIB under various duty cycles. It is shown that the retired LIB from its first-life is still suitable to be used in the PV grid-tied battery (PVGB) system for another 10 years.

This article investigates the impacts of bidirectional EVs on power quality, voltage profile, and frequency stability of the power grid. For this purpose, a detailed model of practical bidirectional onboard charger is presented to measure the total harmonic distortion (THD) in the grid current caused by the EVs.

The effects of bidirectional EVs on the voltage profile is also explored by implementing current summation method (CSM)-derived power flow analysis for IEEE 33-Bus radial distribution system.

Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can cause difficulties in the electrical grid and system operation. To circumvent this issue, an efficacious stochastic optimization model is developed in this paper to enable the control entity to manage generation and storage assets by controlling the charging behavior of PEVs. To achieve the lowest total cost, a new strategy for reducing reliability costs is proposed. In this regard, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) tool is used to reduce the overall system cost. The presented energy management model for the MG in the grid-connected mode takes into consideration the uncertainty of output power of the wind turbine (WT) and the photovoltaic (PV), as well as the PEVs’ charging and discharging. In this study, an innovative and effective optimization algorithm known as the modified fluid search optimization algorithm (MFSO) is utilized to optimize the MG operation problem. The results show that the suggested model incorporating electric vehicles (EVs) can enable MG operation at the minimum cost and reliability. As can be observed, the amount of time required by the presented method to solve the first case problem is 6.64s, which is significantly less than the amount of time required by the other methods. In a similar vein, the MFSO method is noticeably quicker than both GA and PSO when applied to case studies 2 and 3. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Electric vehicle; Energy systems; Fuel cell; MG model; Optimal planning","Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Fuel cells; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Plug-in electric vehicles; Proven reserves; Vehicle-to-grid; Energy systems; Fuel cell system; Integrated energy systems; MG model; Microgrid; Optimal design; Optimal planning; Optimization algorithms; Planning and design; Search optimization; Fossil fuels","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.61862051), the Science and Technology Foundation of Guizhou Province (No.[2019]1299, No.ZK[2022]449), the Top-notch Talent Program of Guizhou province (No.KY[2018]080), the Natural Science Foundation of Education of Guizhou province(No.[2019]203) and the Funds of Qiannan Normal University for Nationalities (No. qnsy2019rc09).

However, conventional distribution network schedulers were not designed with these variables in mind. Furthermore, the increased use of EVs for environmental reasons mandates the planning of EV parking spaces. As a result, distribution network designers must examine network technical difficulties, design approaches, and changing consumer needs. The placement of dispersed manufacturing resources and EV parking without sufficient planning and ideal location leads in economic challenges for investors and technical concerns for the network. As a result, future distribution networks should prioritize the ideal placement of EV parking lots and distributed production resources in order to maximize network capabilities and meet the needs of companies and power applications in the digital society. According to the findings, the rate of EV parking installations is very high. When power consumers remain connected to the grid during peak hours, distribution businesses benefit significantly, and the overall voltage profile improves. Variations in electric vehicle (EV) battery capacity, power cost, EV adoption, and the weighting coefficients required for optimization will all have different outcomes. It is critical to precisely determine the battery capacity of electric vehicles (EVs) as well as the efficiency of inverters in order to produce more accurate results. According to the findings, increasing the number of parking lot for EVs in a network enhances the benefit from minimizing losses, and providing peak load significantly. So that using 2 parking lot for EVs in a network can increase the overall profit to 129%. © 2024 University of Mohaghegh Ardabili.

Two scenarios are addressed: (1) a ‘‘business-as-usual’’ (BAU) scenario with modest ZEV adoption, and (2) a ‘‘carbon neutral’’ scenario that achieves carbon neutrality by 2045 with proactive ZEV adoption. Electricity load for fueling ZEVs is projected, including electricity fuel for battery electric vehicles and electrolytic hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicles. This electric load was input into an electric grid dispatch model and electric grid and air quality analyses were conducted. The results revealed that although medium-and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) are projected to have lower total electric load associated with fueling, they will require roughly double the electricity for hydrogen production of light-duty vehicles. For the electric grid scenarios examined, ZEV loads increased peak electricity demand by 3% to 6% in 2030 and 22% to 31% in 2045. MHDV time-of-use and smart charging strategies were equally able to shift charging demand to off-peak times. Higher ZEV loads under the carbon neutral scenario increased natural gas use up to 6% in 2030 and energy storage requirements up to 45% in 2045 compared with the BAU scenario. The analyses also found that achieving carbon neutrality through ZEV adoption had the cobenefit of significantly reducing ground-level ozone and PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations in key regions of California, providing health savings of approximately $28 billion annually in 2045. © National Academy of Sciences.","electric and hybrid-electric vehicles; electricity grid; hydrogen/fuel cells; regional and state planning; transportation and sustainability","Air quality; Carbon; Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Hydrogen production; Natural gas vehicles; Power generation; Roads and streets; Vehicle-to-grid; Business-as-usual; California; Carbon neutrals; Electric and hybrid-electric vehicle; Electric grids; Electricity grids; Hydrogen fuel cells; Regional and state planning; Transportation and sustainability; Zero emission vehicles; Gas emissions","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153374422"

In this paper, the scheduling and management framework of an energy hub (EH) is presented with the aim of energy profit maximization in partnership with electricity, natural gas, and district heating networks (EGHNs) considering the coordinated multi-energy management based on the day-ahead market. The optimum capacity of EH equipment, including photovoltaic and wind renewable energy sources, a combined heat and power system (CHP), a boiler, energy storage, and electric vehicles is determined in the day-ahead market using the improved Fick’s law algorithm (IFLA), considering the energy profit maximization and also satisfying the linear network and hub constraints. The conventional FLA is inspired by the concept of Fick’s diffusion law, and, in this study, its performance against premature convergence is improved by using Rosenbrock’s direct rotational method. The performance of the IFLA when applied to EH coordinated scheduling and management problems with the aim of profit maximization is compared with the conventional FLA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) methods. The results show that the proposed scheduling and multi-energy management framework achieves more energy profit in the day-ahead electricity, gas, and heating markets by satisfying the operation and EH constraints compared to other methods. Furthermore, according to the findings, the increased (decreased) demand and the forced outage rate caused a decrease (increase) in the EH profit.

The lack of widespread public charging infrastructure hinders this electric vehicle (EV) transition. Extreme fast charging along interstates and highway corridors is a potential solution. However, the legacy power grid based on alternating current (AC) beckons for costly upgrades that will be necessary to sustain sporadic fast charging loads. The primary goal of this paper is to propose a sustainable, low-loss, extremely fast charging infrastructure based on photovoltaics (PV) and co-located lithium-ion battery storage (BESS). Lithium-ion BESS plays a pivotal role in our proposed design by mitigating demand charges and operating as an independent 16–18 h power source. An end-to-end direct current power network with high voltage direct current interconnection is also incorporated. The design methodology focuses on comprehensive hourly EV-load models generated for different types of passenger vehicles and heavy-duty fleet charging. Appropriate PV-BESS sizing, optimum tilt, and temperature compensation techniques based on 15 years of irradiation data were utilized in the design. The proposed grid-independent DC power networks can significantly improve well-to-wheels efficiency by minimizing total system losses for fast charging networks. The network power savings for low, medium, and high voltage use cases were evaluated. Our results demonstrate 17% to 25% power savings compared to the traditional AC case. © 2023 by the authors.","electric vehicles; extreme fast charging; high voltage direct current; lithium-ion battery storage; photovoltaics","Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric impedance measurement; Electric loads; Electric network analysis; Electric power system interconnection; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Ions; Alternating current; Battery storage; Charging infrastructures; End to end; Extreme fast charging; Fast charging; Heavy duty; High-Voltage Direct Current; Lithium-ion battery storage; Photovoltaics; Lithium-ion batteries","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151249955"

The cooperation of related stakeholders, especially institutions, distribution companies and new technology developers is of great importance in terms of foreseeing and preventing the problems to be encountered and of benefiting together. As it becomes more challenging to maintain the balance between energy supply and demand in electric power systems due to the stochasticity of both load demands and renewable power generation, Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries can play a critical role in supporting this balance for a given period. In this study, an optimization algorithm based on mixed integer linear programming is used to evaluate the economic and technical benefits of EVs when they are used as mobile energy storage systems by system operators, which is called the concept of “Vehicle for Grid” (VfG). It is particularly aimed to alleviate the load demand on grid during the peak energy periods.

The suggested methodology was used to answer the problem of optimal dynamic generation scheduling for the thermal generation unit along with thermal unit integrated with renewable sources such as wind, solar, and electric vehicles. The problem is solved using a unique hybrid CSMA-SCA optimizer in three steps: first, the units are prioritized based on the average full load cost, and the unit scheduling solution is used without consideration of the many constraints that have an impact on the solutions. The second step is the establishment of a heuristic constraints repair mechanism, which forces previous solutions to comply with inescapable constraints. The third step is the implementation of an optimal power generation share allocation for all participating units. To model the stochastic behavior of wind speed and solar radiation, the Weibull probability distribution and Beta PDF functions are used. To avoid the algorithm from slipping into local minima and achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation, a novel chaotic position updating method called Singer map-based position updating is proposed. The suggested method has proven effective in small-, medium-, and large-scale thermal power systems as well as thermal systems that integrate wind power. The extensive studies demonstrate that the CSMA-SCA methodology presented in this research outperforms most current methods in terms of producing high-quality solutions around global minima.

Due to the stochastic nature of RES generation and electric vehicles (EVs), risky operational challenges might impact the grid. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective planning framework to optimally allocate EVCSs in conjunction with RESs. Specifically, the proposed RESs and EVCSs planning framework considers three sub-objectives to be minimized, i.e., voltage deviations, energy losses, and EVs owners'dissatisfaction. Further, active power curtailment of RESs is precluded while considering the diverse operational constraints of the grid, RESs, and EVCSs. To provide further benefits, advanced control schemes of the interconnecting RES inverters, grid-To-vehicle (G2V), and vehicle-To-grid (V2G) schemes are considered in the proposed framework. A two-level approach is developed to solve this holistic framework with competing sub-functions to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. The outer optimization level precisely optimizes the RES locations and sizes, along with the optimal places of the EVCS. On the other hand, the inner level determines the optimal EVCS charging considering stochastic EV power, RES inverter reactive power, and the time-of-use energy tariff. The proposed framework has been tested on the 69-bus distribution system. The simulation results reveal the efficacy of the proposed RES and EVCS planning framework. The total voltage deviation and energy losses achieved by the proposed framework are reduced by 96% and 74%, respectively, with respect to the uncontrolled charging of EVs, while the owners' satisfactions are met. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","charging stations; Electric vehicles; planning framework; renewable energy","Charging (batteries); Electric inverters; Electric losses; Electric machine control; Electric power distribution; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Linear programming; Pareto principle; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Charging station; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Inverter; Linear-programming; Optimisations; Planning framework; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141636052"

In addition, the increasing complexity of power grids, growing demand, and environmental and energy sustainability concerns intensify the need for energy management solutions and energy demand reduction strategies. Hence, integration strategies for energy efficiency in the building and transport sector are increasingly important. The present study considers key parameters leading to Electric Vehicle adoption, utilizing background data from countries where Electric Vehicles have already been introduced and adopted in everyday living. The study also presents a case study of an energy management scheme in Greece, where the penetration rate is still low.

In this regard, this work employs mobile edge computing (MEC) to design a decentralized hierarchical algorithm for finding an optimal path to the nearby A-EV parking lots (PLs), selecting the best PL, and executing an optimal charging scheduling. The proposed model makes use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist edge servers in trajectory planning by surveying road traffic flow in real time. Furthermore, the target PLs are selected using a user-driven multiobjective problem to minimize the cost and waiting time of A-EVs. To tackle the complexity of the optimization problem, a greedy-based algorithm has been developed. Finally, charging/discharging power is scheduled using a local optimizer based on the PLs' real-time loads, which minimizes the deviation of the charging/discharging power from the average load. The obtained results show that the proposed model can handle charging/discharging requests of on-move A-EVs and bring fiscal and nonfiscal benefits for A-EVs and the power grid, respectively. Moreover, it observed that user satisfaction in terms of traveling time and traveling distance is increased by using the edge-UAV model. © 2015 IEEE.","Autonomous electric vehicle (A-EV); greedy algorithm; mobile edge computing (MEC); trajectory planning; vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Electric power transmission networks; Hierarchical systems; Interactive computer systems; Mobile edge computing; Scheduling; Surveys; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle-to-grid; Autonomous electric vehicle; Greedy algorithms; Optimisations; Processor scheduling; Real - Time system; Road; Trajectory Planning; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G); Real time systems","This work was supported in part by the PGR Scholarship (RDF Studentship) at Northumbria University and in part by DTE Network+ funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under Grant EP/S032053/1.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135742432"

Electricity distributors require full visibility on the EV distribution to better manage operation planning of their distribution grid. However, they often have incomplete knowledge of EV presence in their network. Identifying EV customers (charging at home) using smart meter data is a nontrivial task for the grid network and energy scheduling. The difficulties include recognizing charging patterns, balancing the number of EV and non-EV customers during modeling, and building an efficient classification model. In this article, we propose a periodic pattern recognition method to extract useful EV charging patterns. Real world smart meter datasets are unbalanced with few EVs and majority of energy customers are those without EVs. We improve Kmedoids evaluated by dynamic time warping to obtain the representative non-EV training samples so that balanced samples over EV and non-EV customers can be obtained.

Most countries are witnessing a rapid development of the necessary charging infrastructure and a consequent increase in EV energy demand. In this context, power demand forecasting is an essential tool for planning and integrating EV charging as much as possible with the electric grid, renewable sources, storage systems, and their management systems. However, this forecasting is still challenging due to several reasons: the still not statistically significant number of circulating EVs, the different users’ behavior based on the car parking scenario, the strong heterogeneity of both charging infrastructure and EV population, and the uncertainty about the initial state of charge (SOC) distribution at the beginning of the charge. This paper aims to provide a forecasting method that considers all the main factors that may affect each charging event. The users’ behavior in different urban scenarios is predicted through their statistical pattern. A similar approach is used to forecast the EV’s initial SOC. A machine learning approach is adopted to develop a battery-charging behavioral model that takes into account the different EV model charging profiles. The final algorithm combines the different approaches providing a forecasting of the power absorbed by each single charging session and the total power absorbed by charging hubs. The algorithm is applied to different parking scenarios and the results highlight the strong difference in power demand among the different analyzed cases. © 2023 by the authors.","charging hub; electric vehicles; EV power demand forecasting; machine learning; urban scenarios","Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Forecasting; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging hub; Charging infrastructures; Demand forecasting; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle power demand forecasting; Machine-learning; Power demands; Urban scenarios; User behaviors; Vehicle power demand; Machine learning","This study was carried out within the MOST–Sustainable Mobility Center and received funding from the European Union Next-GenerationEU (PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR)–MISSIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.4–D.D. 1033 17/06/2022, CN00000023).

The appropriate sizing and positioning of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) are concurrently determined to curtail the negative impact of their placement on the distribution network’s operational parameters. The charging station location problem is presented in a multi-objective context comprising voltage stability, reliability, the power loss (VRP) index and cost as objective functions. RES and EVCS location and capacity are chosen as the objective variables. The objective functions are tested on modified IEEE 33 and 123-bus radial distribution systems. The minimum value of cost obtained is USD 2.0250 × 106 for the proposed case. The minimum value of the VRP index is obtained by innovative scheme 6, i.e., 9.6985 and 17.34 on 33-bus and 123-bus test systems, respectively.

The smart grids become more complicated due to the presence of small-scale low inertia generators and the implementation of electric vehicles (EVs), which are mainly based on intermittent and variable renewable energy resources. Optimal and reliable operation of this environment using conventional model-based approaches is very difficult. Advancements in measurement and communication technologies have brought the opportunity of collecting temporal or real-time data from prosumers through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Smart metering brings the potential of applying data-driven algorithms for different power system operations and planning services, such as infrastructure sizing and upgrade and generation forecasting. It can also be used for demand-side management, especially in the presence of new technologies such as EVs, 5G/6G networks and cloud computing. These algorithms face privacy-preserving and cybersecurity challenges that need to be well addressed. This article surveys the state-of-the-art of each of these topics, reviewing applications, challenges and opportunities of using smart meters to address them. It also stipulates the challenges that smart grids present to smart meters and the benefits that smart meters can bring to smart grids.

Four cases are investigated to study the impacts of EV integration on environmental and economic requirements. In order to facilitate the installation of EV charging stations, the proposed model is formulated to combine the planning models of renewable energy systems, energy storage systems (ESSs), thyristor-controlled series compensators, and transmission lines into the EV-based planning problem. The first objective function aims to maximize EVs’ penetration by increasing the networks’ capacity to supply charging stations throughout the day, whereas the second objective, on the other hand, emphasizes lowering the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-based generation units in order to benefit the environment. The third objective is to meet the financial requirements by lowering the initial investment and operating costs of the installed devices. The proposed model is written as a multi-objective optimization problem that is solved using the multi-objective version of the Gazelle optimization algorithm (MGOA). The efficiency of the MGOA was tested by solving a set of four benchmark test functions and the proposed problem. The obtained results demonstrated the MGOA’s superiority in solving multi-objective optimization problems when compared to some well-known optimization algorithms in terms of robustness and solution quality. The MGOA’s robustness was between 20% and 30% and outperformed other algorithms by 5%. The MGO was successful in outperforming the other algorithms in providing a better solution. The Egyptian West Delta Network simulations revealed a 250 MWh increase in the energy supplied to EVs when energy storage was not used. However, storage systems were necessary for shifting EV charging periods away from high solar radiation scenarios. The use of ESS increased greenhouse gas emissions. When ESS was installed with a capacity of 1116.4 MWh, the carbon emissions increased by approximately 208.29 million metric tons. ESS’s role in improving the EV’s hosting capacity grows as more renewables are added to the network.

This paper examines the impacts of a microgrid system considering Electric Vehicle Grid Integration (EVGI) based on stochastic metaheuristic methods. One of the biggest challenges to slowing down global climate change is the transition to sustainable mobility. Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) integrated with Evs are considered a solution for the power and environmental issues needed to achieve Sustainable Development Goal Seven (SDG7) and Climate Action Goal 13 (CAG13). The aforementioned goals can be achieved by coupling Evs with the utility grid and other RESs using Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology to form a hybrid system. Overloading is a challenge due to the unknown number of loads (unknown number of Evs). Thus, this study helps to establish the system impact of the uncertainties (arrival and departure Evs) by proposing Stochastic Monte Carlo Method (SMCM) to be addressed. The main objective of this research is to size the system configurations using a metaheuristic algorithm and analyze the impact of an uncertain number of Evs on the distribution of residential power in Tripoli-Libya to gain a cost-effective, reliable, and renewable system. The Improved Antlion Optimization (IALO) algorithm is an optimization technique used for determining the optimal number of configurations of the hybrid system considering multiple sources, while the Rule-Based Energy Management Strategy (RB-EMS) controlling algorithm is used to control the flow of power in the electric power system. The sensitivity analysis of the effect parameters has been taken into account to assess the expected impact in the future.

In this mode, the batteries are charged at a central charging station (CCS). Then they will be distributed among BSSs. Moreover, there is no charging equipment at BSSs, and depleted batteries are returned to the CCS to recharge. In this context, firstly, a probabilistic model is developed to estimate the power consumption profile of the CCS. Then, a planning framework comprised of linear and nonlinear parts is introduced to minimize the total investment and operation costs. In the linear part, a binary integer linear programing (BILP) model is proposed to determine the optimal place and grade of BSSs, considering the investment cost of BSSs as well as the batteries transportation costs. In the nonlinear part, which is solved by genetic algorithm (GA), a model is developed to find out which branches of the distribution network need to be reinforced to minimize the network reinforcement and energy loss costs.

In view of the coordinated charging of EVs under the photovoltaic (PV) energy connected to the power grid, a collaborative charging control strategy is proposed based on a double deep q-network with Prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER). Specifically, Long–Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is utilized to capture the uncertainties caused by power requirement, PV power, and real-time electricity price. Then, a modified DDQN approach and the corresponding reward function are applied to solve the cooperative charging problem. In addition, the introduction of a PER mechanism based on TD bias sampling in reinforcement learning alleviates the problem of reward sparsity in learning scenarios and improves the training stability and efficiency. The proposed approach can achieve collaborative scheduling of EVs, which helps reduce the charging cost, promote the consumption of PV energy and avoid transformer overload. Simulation case studies based on real data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the charging cost by 30% and increase the PV power utilization by 10% compared to the DDQN algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Charging scheduling; Deep reinforcement learning; Electric vehicles; Smart grid","Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Electric power distribution; Electric power system control; Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Long short-term memory; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging scheduling; Deep reinforcement learning; Electric vehicle charging; Experience replay; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic power; Reinforcement learnings; Scheduling strategies; Smart grid; Transformer overloads; Reinforcement learning","This study has been funded by Key Research and Promotion Project of Henan Province, China ( 212102210412 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 62176088 ), and Postgraduate Cultivating Innovation and Quality Improvement Action Plan of Henan University, China ( SYLYC2022194 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143507311"

In the proposed methodology, a realistic and stochastic charging demand distribution was obtained with the travel chain of an EV and the associated probability density function. Based on the charging demand of EV owners and a multi-operator scenario, a two-stage effective and practical charging station planning model was established. The first stage of the planning model optimized the location of charging stations to decrease the total deadhead mileage of the EVs with the cooperation of the charging station operators. In the second stage, the operators were committed to increasing their economic benefits by developing a charging station capacity strategy in the framework of the non-cooperative game. Furthermore, the combination of an adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization algorithm (AMPSO) and approximate Nash equilibrium had a better effect in reducing the difficulty of solving the game model and obtaining an optimal planning strategy.

However, their growth poses significant challenges to system operation, such as bidirectional power flow, intermittent power generation, increased peak demand, and unexpected frequency/voltage fluctuation. To tackle these challenges, we developed a vehicle-to-grid model, which incorporated dynamic electric vehicles usages, such as driving times, driving distance, and charging/discharging locations. The machine learning method of principal component analysis and XGBoost were used to develop the solar energy prediction model. We also developed a novel unit commitment model to coordinate and aggregate the distributed energy resources in power generation economic dispatch. Electric vehicle charging was used as elastic demand and electric vehicle discharging was used as power generation sources. The solar energy was considered as a negative load. Simulation results showed that uncontrolled electric vehicle charging and solar energy could negatively impact the power systems. For example, the load ramping rate was increased by 384%. Simulation results also showed that the proposed models could mitigate the negative impact and improve energy efficiency. For example, the peak demand, load ramping rate and average generation cost were reduced by 21%, 79%, and 27%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Distributed energy resources; Electric vehicle; Solar energy; Unit commitment; Vehicle to grid","Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Scheduling; Vehicle-to-grid; Demand response; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric vehicle charging; Peak demand; Power-distribution system; Ramping rate; Solar panels; Systems operation; Unit Commitment; Vehicle to grids; Solar energy","The authors would like to thank Mitacs and the University of Regina for providing funding for this study.

With the proliferation of novel DC loads (e.g., e-bikes and electric vehicles), DC loads will dominate the loads in buildings. It is necessary to develop a DC power distribution method that better accommodates renewable energy, effectively improves the working efficiency of loads, and significantly enhances energy utilization efficiency. However, there is not yet a unified design for the multi-port converter of DC microgrids. The experience is severely lacking in the overall energy planning for buildings from the perspectives of economy and environmental friendliness. To solve the problems, this paper explores the intelligent decision optimization for energy control in DC power distribution system with multi-port access for intelligent buildings. Firstly, a feature analysis was carried out on the multi-port converter of the DC power distribution system for intelligent buildings. With economy and environmental friendliness as the goals, the authors designed constraints related to energy output power, power balance, and distribution node voltage, and established an intelligent decision optimization model for the energy control of the DC microgrid for intelligent buildings. The model was combined with the multi-attribute decision-making framework into a decision-making framework for the coordinated operation of distributed energy supply units, which is based on the interval evidential reasoning (IER). Finally, the authors proposed an evaluation method for the decision-making of the energy control of DC power distribution for intelligent buildings, based on the Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operator, and the IER-based decision-making framework. The proposed method was proved effective through experiments. © 2022","Direct current (DC) power distribution; Energy control; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent decision optimization; Multi-port access","Decision making; Electric impedance measurement; Electric power system control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Direct current power distribution; Direct current power; Direct-current; Intelligent decision optimization; Intelligent decisions; Multi-port; Multi-port access; Optimisations; Power distributions; Power-distribution system; Power control","Project Supported by Qinglan Project for the University Key Teacher from Jiangsu Education Department (2020); The Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (Grant No.: 19KJB470018); The Science and Technology Project of Jiangsu Province Construction System (Grant No.: 2018ZD065); The Key Research and Development Program of the XuZhou Municipal (Grant No.: KC19224).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136759051"

It helps in reducing the carbon footprints in the environment. However, security and privacy of the information exchange between different entities are significant concerns keeping in view of the information exchange via an open channel, i.e., Internet among different entities such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), charging stations (CSs), and controllers in V2G environment. With an exponential rise in Electric vehicles (EVs) usage across the globe, there is a requirement of developing a seamless charging infrastructure for charging and billing. Moreover, secure information flow needs to be maintained at different levels in such an environment. Hence, this paper proposes a blockchain-based demand response management for efficient energy trading between EVs and CSs. In this proposal, miner nodes and block verifiers are selected using their power consumption and processing power. These nodes are responsible for the authentication of various transactions in the proposal. We also proposed a game theory-based solution to support energy management and peak load control off-peak and peak conditions.

Despite its challenges, e-carsharing has an opportunity to still profit in periods of low rental demand compared to traditional carsharing. The purpose of this paper is to assess the profitability of an e–carsharing company based on distribution local marginal price (DLMP) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) that cooperates with the distribution system operator (DSO) through a two-stage stochastic model. The AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) is modeled using second-order cone programming (SOCP) linearized by the global polyhedral approximation. The IEEE 33 bus test system and a real Kernel distribution for the EV rental demands are used in four planning cases in the GAMS environment. The results indicate that the proposed methodology does not affect EV user satisfaction. Moreover, the planning disregarding the power grid perspective is the most profitable, but the operation may not be possible in real applications due to the high-power flows via V2G. Finally, the e–carsharing planning considering the DSO perspective increased the charging cost by 1.66 % but also reduced the DLMP peak, losses, and peak demand by 2.5 %, 1.5 %, and 5.1 %, respectively. One important conclusion is that the technical benefits brought to the DSO by the e–carsharing company could be turned into services and advantages for both agents, increasing profit and mitigating negative impacts, such as higher operational costs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carsharing; Electric vehicles; Locational marginal price; Siting and sizing; Two-stage stochastic optimization","Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Second-order cone programming; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Carsharing; Demand uncertainty; Distribution systems; Locational marginal prices; Marginal prices; Price-based; Siting and sizings; Stochastic optimizations; System operator; Two-stage stochastic optimization; Profitability; distribution system; electric vehicle; optimization; profitability; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis","This research was supported in part by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) under Grant 001, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) under grants 404068/2020-0, Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) under grant APQ-03609-17, and Instituto Nacional de Energia Elétrica (INERGE).

It is necessary to consider it as a significant charging method in future urban scenarios. The development of EVs and charging facilities has brought about the electrification of transportation, forming a power-traffic system. To maximize the comprehensive performance of the system, this paper proposes a planning strategy for the coexistence of static and dynamic charging facilities. First, considering the response of vehicle users in the transportation network to the planned results, we design a bi-level optimization framework. Then, in the lower-level optimization model, taking into account the charging demands of different vehicles, we construct a multi-class user equilibrium model and adopt a modified adaptive path generation algorithm and a variable update factor algorithm to solve the traffic assignment problem. In the upper level, we utilize an evaluation indicator to indicate the comprehensive performance of the system, and the evaluation indicator is minimized under constraints on the capacities, charging prices, and usage prices of hybrid charging facilities. Then, an algorithm based on the surrogate model is introduced to solve the bi-level programming. Finally, the case studies demonstrate the advantages of hybrid charging facilities as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of the solution algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic wireless charging; Electric vehicles; Power distribution network; Traffic assignment problem; Transportation network; User equilibrium","Charging (batteries); Combinatorial optimization; Costs; Electric power distribution; Inductive power transmission; Planning; Charging facilities; Comprehensive performance; Dynamic wireless charging; Evaluation indicators; Power distribution network; Statics and dynamics; Traffic assignment problem; Transportation network; User equilibrium; Wireless charging; Electric vehicles; algorithm; electric vehicle; electrification; network analysis; optimization; performance assessment; planning process; planning system","This work was partially supported by National Key R&D Program of China (Grant NO. 2021YFB3301000 ); Science Fund for Creative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant NO. 61621002 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC: 62173297 ), Zhejiang Key R&D Program, China (Grant NO. 2022C01035 ), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (NO. 226-2022-00086 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142365569"

The natural resource of fossil fuels, have been exploited for many years, such resources have also been depleted dramatically. The above-mentioned facts determine the need to conduct research that will demonstrate the technological and socio-economical possibilities of transforming energy systems and parts of transport systems from fossil fuels to renewable energy. This paper presents the idea of supplying a selected region, 100% with RES, accounting for costs and environmental efficiencies, for the entire energy system. Further, the analysis of the subject indicated a need to conduct research on correlations derived from integrating collective heating, transport systems with high V2G energy storage capacity and power systems, in order to optimize the functioning of the entire energy market. Furthermore, the above considerations suggest that there is a need to propose a new model for electrical systems, different than the one based on the classical concept of producer-recipient. This research was carried out through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative analysis applied agent-based modelling; A method supported by extensive qualitative research. The conducted research indicates that renewable energy systems demonstrate greater cost and environmental competitiveness, than conventional energy systems. Furthermore, it has been shown that the integration of collective heating and transport systems, with the energy system has a positive impact on the efficiency of the entire system, by reducing primary energy demand and decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. Finally, the conducted research revealed that the reduction of energy demand, has a positive effect on the transformation of a conventional energy system, into a RES system. © 2023, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

Planning for radial PDNs is essential to enhance redundancy resilience, reduce disruptions, and improve overall efficiency. However, traditional PDN planning methods have become obsolete due to the proliferation of Distributed Generation (DG) resources and energy storage systems. Additionally, the rise of Electric Vehicles (EVs) demands sophisticated charging infrastructure planning. This article presents a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for joint expansion planning of PDN and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs). The model takes into account the construction or reinforcement of substations and circuits, along with the integration of EVs, the installation of DGs, and the placement of capacitor banks, all regarded as traditional conventional expansion options alternatives. To address uncertainties associated with DG generation, conventional loads, and EV demand, our model identifies optimal installation and asset locations. We formulate this as a stochastic scenario-based program with chance constraints for Power Distribution Network Expansion Planning (PDNEP), minimizing investment, operational, and energy loss cost costs over a planning horizon. Through two deterministic and stochastic approaches, encompassing six case studies on an 18-node test system, we evaluate the effectiveness of our model. Results are further validated on a 54-node system, confirming the model’s robustness. Notably, the numerical findings underscore the substantial cost reduction achieved by including EVCSs in the stochastic expansion planning approach, demonstrating its cost-effectiveness. In case study I, where all EVs charge at home during peak hours, it’s the worst case for the PDN. The 54-node system, more complex, demands longer computational time. In the 18-node system, costs improve from 9.97% (case study II) to 3.96% (case study VI) versus the worst-case (case I). In the 54-node system, improvements range from 10.47% (case study II) to 1.40% (case study VI). As a result, In comparative analyses against deterministic and stochastic approaches, our model consistently outperforms in diverse test case studies. The proposed model’s adaptability to address uncertainties underscores its suitability for solving the PDNEP problem in PND. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Chance-Constraint Programming; electric vehicle charging stations; expansion planning; mixed-integer linear programming; power distribution systems; stochastic model; uncertainty","Charging (batteries); Constraint programming; Constraint theory; Cost reduction; Electric loads; Electric network analysis; Electric power distribution; Electric substations; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Investments; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Chance constraint programming; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Expansion planning; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear; Mixed-integer linear programming; Power-distribution system; Stochastic-modeling; Uncertainty; Cost effectiveness","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180897828"

This adversely affects network flows. The situation can further worsen, causing congestion in the distribution network and a rise in energy prices. In this paper, an attempt is made to resolve this issue through Distributed generators (DGs) placed in a grid-connected microgrid. The authors propose a methodology based on “Distribution Locational Marginal pricing (DLMP)” and the use of “Hybrid optimal Firefly Particle Swarm Optimization” with “TOPSIS” (HFPSO-TOPSIS) approach for optimal DG sizing in this methodology. The methodology consists of two stages. The first stage is locating DGs on the bus, and the second stage is sizing DGs and their participation in providing ancillary service of congestion management through a grid-connected microgrid. The method is tested on a “modified IEEE 33 bus radial active distribution system”. Two different system conditions in which congestion can occur are analyzed and congestion is successfully removed by this proposed method. Power Loss reduction of more than 75% is achieved in each case after the implementation of the proposed methodology.

In order to improve the understanding of EV charging behaviour, we present the open access EV Charging Profiles and Waveforms (EV-CPW) dataset for AC charging. The dataset comprises of charging profiles and high-resolution current/voltage AC waveforms for 12 different EV's, including popular battery EV's and plug-in hybrid EV's. A power quality analysis is carried out to compare the EV charging behaviours to new standards recommendations proposed by standards agencies. This includes evaluating power factor, current and voltage distortion, harmonic content and load behaviour in relation to grid voltage and frequency. The preliminary data analysis presented reveals that each EV has distinctive charging characteristics and the power quality analysis indicates variation in the on-board charger circuits employed by the EV's. The EV-CPW dataset can be used for many more applications and studies, including EV charging infrastructure planning, demand management, EV charging coupled with renewable energy studies, power quality analysis, equipment lifetime studies and power electronics design.

Accurate EV charging load prediction is essential for the efficiency of electric system planning and economic operation of electric system. This paper proposes an electric vehicle charging load predicting method based on variational mode decomposition and Prophet-LSTM. Firstly, the variational mode decomposition algorithm is used to decompose the charging load into several intrinsic mode functions in order to explore the characteristics of EV charging load data. Secondly, in order to make full use of the advantages of various forecasting methods, the intrinsic mode functions are classified into low and high frequency sequences based on their over-zero rates. The high and low frequency sequences are reconstructed to obtain two frequency sequences. Then the LSTM neural network and Prophet model are used to predict the high and low frequency sequences, respectively. Finally, the prediction results obtained from the prediction of high frequency and low frequency sequences are combined to obtain the final prediction result. The assessment of the prediction results shows that the prediction accuracy of the prediction method proposed in this paper is improved compared to the traditional prediction methods, and the average absolute error is lower than that of ARIMA, LSTM and Prophet respectively by 7.57%, 8.73%, and 46.02%.

This places significant strain on distribution networks (DNs). To address this issue, this paper proposes a promising method that harnesses the untapped potential of electric railway systems (ERSs) and wasted regenerative braking energy (RBE) of trains in combination with a battery energy storage system (BESS) to supply EV charging station and participate in the FCS energy supply chain (FCS-ESCH). The proposed integrated approach, as the intermodal sustainable electric transportation system (SETS), aims to reduce the peak power demand of FCSs especially at strategic locations, such as parking areas close to electric railway stations and park-And-ride areas. To achieve this goal, an operation-Aware optimization model is developed that determines the optimal sizes of the interfacing converter and the BESS, while also proceeding with optimal energy exchange planning. A generic model for trains' RBE production is proposed, as well, and adapted to the operation-Aware optimization model to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting simulations of a real case study that accurately replicates system behavior with the desired level of precision. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are performed to explore the impact of varying the power rating of the interfacing converter responsible for transmitting RBE to the FCS-ESCH, as well as the per-unit price of BESS energy capacity. The results showcase the potential of employing SETS as an efficient means to mitigate the challenges associated with FCSs, especially peak shaving and cost reductions, paving the way for a more sustainable electric transportation system. © 2013 IEEE.","Electric railway system; fast-charging station; optimal planning; optimal sizing; regenerative braking energy","Charging (batteries); Electric potential; Electric power distribution; Electric power utilization; Electric railroads; Optimization; Railroads; Rails; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Electric railway system; Electric railways; Fast charging stations; Force; Index; Optimal planning; Optimal sizing; Power demands; Rail transportation; Railway electrifications; Railway system; Regenerative braking energies; Cost reduction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176336123"

The energy hub concept is used to meet the demands of different energy carriers in these sections. In this paper, a new method for energy management of a microgrid is presented in an intelligent network based on three types of commercial, residential, and industrial energy hubs. In the energy hubs, a wide range of components, including renewable and nonrenewable generation units, converters, storage devices, intelligent parking lots consisting of electric vehicles, P2G units, and cogeneration units, are used to supply electrical, heating, cooling, and natural gas energies. Some parameters like renewable generations, energy demands, and arriving and departure time of electric vehicles are considered to be uncertain, and a relevant method is applied to provide a near-realistic profile for them. In addition, a demand response paradigm has also been proposed for three types of electrical, heating, and cooling demands at the hub output side. Therefore, in this method, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed based on benefit and reduction of emission caused by the activity of gas-burning units for short-term planning and obtaining an optimal solution for generation and sending loads in a distribution network containing energy hubs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed modeling and structure, the presented approach is applied on a modified 33-bus IEEE test network. According to the results of the energy management model, it is possible to significantly increase benefits and also obtain a smoother consumption pattern in consumption with financial incentives. © 2023 Majid Abbasi Gharai et al.","","Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Housing; Integer programming; Microgrids; Uncertainty analysis; Virtual storage; Community activities; Demand response; Eco-environmental; Electrical heating; Energy carriers; Energy hubs; Microgrid; On demands; Parking lots; Power; Energy management","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173247851"

Thus, it is crucial to comprehensively assess the influence of EV charging load on the distribution system. To mitigate the operational risks and optimize control measures of the power network, a two-stage time series decomposition and BiLSTM deep learning architecture is proposed for accurately predicting EV charging load series. In the first stage, a Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) evaluation method is introduced for assessing the decomposition loss, and the Lion Swarm Optimization (LSO) is employed to determine the optimal combination of decomposition parameters, thereby reducing the empirical parameter randomness and minimizing the signal loss during the decomposition process. Then, Bidirectional Short and Long-term Memory Network model (BiLSTM) is established for forecasting each sub-sequence obtained through the decomposition process. In the second stage, a DeepBiLSTM model is built to realize the accurate prediction of residual series from the first stage.

Therefore, to support investment decision making there is a requirement to understand the impact LCTs will have on low voltage (LV) distribution network infrastructure across diverse geographical areas. However, LV networks are not only radically different in terms of topology and physical asset characteristics, but also in terms of the demand they serve which is sensitive to the diversity of local conditions such as climate, consumer demographic and building stock. As such, there is an increasing requirement to capture elements of this diversity in the development of LV network and LCT modeling approaches to better quantify place-based LCT impact and to inform the quantification of local area flexibility.

The methodology is demonstrated on LV networks in Scotland through quantification of LCT network impact against key network assessment metrics.

The uncontrolled charging of the battery can cause issues such as overvoltage, overload, unbalanced load, instability, harmonics, and increased loss. Hence, efficient charging methodologies need to be developed for the power grid. The objective of this article is to maximize the total revenue of the charging stations and schedule the charging stations for PEV charging with reduced cost. First, the system model with its objectives such as demand, constraints, and fitness values are computed. Next, efficient charging path planning is proposed using the deep Q network, which is a reinforcement learning model. This can assist the PEV user in selecting the charging station and planning its path. Lastly, the particle sailfish optimization from our previous research work has been used to solve the charging station optimal solution.

Long waiting times at charging stations are a major barrier to the widespread adoption of EVs. Therefore, battery swapping stations (BSSs) are an efficient solution that considers short waiting times and healthy recharging cycles for battery systems. Moreover, swapping stations have emerged as a great opportunity not only for EVs, but also for power systems, with regulation services that can be provided to the grid particularly for small networks, such as microgrid (MG) systems. In this study, the optimum location and size that maximize the revenue of a swap station in an MG system are investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this study is first to solve the placing and sizing problem in the MG from the perspective of a BSS. The results indicate that bus 23 is the BSS's optimal location and is crucial for maximizing revenue and addressing issues like the provision of ancillary services in microgrid system.

High-level EVs integration into the electricity grid will introduce many challenges for the power grid planning, operation, stability, standards, and safety. Therefore, the wide-scale adoption of EVs imposes research and development of charging systems and EV supply equipment (EVSE) to achieve expected charging solutions for EV batteries as well as to improve ancillary services.

An electric vehicle navigation and cluster dispatch model is proposed for improving the overall charging efficiency of EVs on the transportation network and increasing the voltage level of the distribution network. First, a simplified model of vehicles and traffic road network is established, and a cell transmission model (CTM) is used to simulate the real traffic network. The traffic system takes into account charging EVs, discharging EVs, and other vehicles, and traffic congestion is considered. Then, a coupled model of the traffic–power system is built for the orderly charging of electric vehicles upon arrival at a charging station. The model considers the coupling of the two systems on a time scale, and the charging/discharging power at each charging station node is controlled. The validity of the model is verified in a coupled system of 357 cell traffic network and modified IEEE33 nodes.

There is also significant increase in load that may come in the form of electric vehicles (EV) charging and hydrogen requirement for decarbonization of other sectors. While there is a growing literature around long-term decarbonization strategies, there is still ample room for a practical methodology to rigorously test capacity plans to include a range of options inter alia re- optimization of the mix of renewable technologies, better coordination of the (EV) load from a system perspective, or augmenting the plan with battery energy storage (BESS) and hydrogen. This paper presents our research on EV load and green hydrogen modeling including how they can be integrated into long-term electricity models. We also present a methodology that allows planners to undertake a rigorous assessment that can be readily implemented using the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM). The application of the model is illustrated through a case study for Turkey (Türkiye) for 2050. The case study shows how an incumbent policy-driven capacity plan for 2050 that included 33% contribution from variable renewable energy (VRE) may be prone to unserved energy risk during winter months due to seasonal variability of VRE. The analysis goes on to demonstrate how the plan can be reinforced with additional peaking gas turbines, re- optimization of wind and solar, BESS and hydrogen.

Our methodology utilises a particle swarm optimization, coupled with a range of energy scenarios as to fully evaluate the varying interdependences and importance of economic and reliability indices, for the standalone HGPS. Our analysis indicates that EV charging with peak loading can have significant impact on the HGPS, resulting in significant reductions in the reliability indices of the HGPS, therefore enhance the operation of HGPS and reduces the overall cost.

Moreover, e-mobility can significantly contribute to achieving very high renewable energy source (RES) penetration levels in islands, allowing a reduction both in the emissions due to the conventional generation and the system’s cost. Ιncreased RES penetration, however, can pose technical challenges for an island’s system. In order to overcome these challenges, new technologies like grid-forming converters are important. Moreover, the provision of new ancillary services in relation to battery storage systems might be considered, while novel control and protection schemes are needed to ensure secure operation. E-mobility can also contribute to solving technical problems that arise from very high RES penetration by providing frequency containment reserves or reactive power compensation. Since EV charging demand introduces modifications in the system’s load curve, e-mobility may affect the power grid for long-term planning and short-term operation, i.e., line loading and voltages. The application of specifically developed smart charging methodologies can mitigate the relevant grid impact, while effective exploitation of EV–RES synergies can achieve higher RES penetration levels. This paper examines how e-mobility can contribute to increasing RES penetration in islands while considering the technical issues caused. In particular, this paper takes into account the distinct characteristics of NIIs towards the identification of solutions that will achieve very high RES penetration while also addressing the relevant technical challenges (voltage control, frequency control, short circuit protection, etc.).

The city charging demands are aggregated from individual charging prediction results at a spatial resolution of 0.46 km and time resolution of 15 min quantitatively; the spatiotemporal aggregation results show that the proposed model can realize high accuracy prediction for real-world charging demands. The results are expected to provide the foundation for research on charging infrastructure planning and the impact of charging behaviors on the grid load. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Charging demand; Electric vehicle; Trip chain; User clustering","Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; K-means clustering; Accurate prediction; Characteristics parameters; Charging characteristics; Charging demands; Charging infrastructures; Demand prediction; Infrastructure planning; Real-world; Trip chains; User clustering; Forecasting","The authors would like to acknowledge the funding support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U21A20170 and Grant No. 52072040 ) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFB2501600 ).

A microgrid is an energy system that supplies electricity to customers with renewable and fossil generation sources. Therefore, the main goal of this work in optimal planning of energy hubs includes how to distribute products such as combined energy and heat sources, hydrogen storage systems, electric vehicles, and controllable loads to examine the role of demand side management and renewables. This research study also aimed at minimizing the cost of power generation in the following hours or days, as well as the spread of environmental pollution. Since various sources of uncertainty such as load, energy price in the wind turbine, and solar cell output power market affect the microgrid's economic optimization, this research study is covered by probabilistic modeling. The hydrogen storage system includes an electrolyzer, hydrogen tanks, and a fuel cell. We apply the load-side response program to flatten the load diagram and optimize the microgrid use. As this model has different objective functions, a multi-objective random algorithm was proposed to solve it. Finally, the proposed model and method for a sample system in different scenarios are discussed. Based on obtained results from all scenarios, the first case reduced the operating cost by 20.75 % and 15.17 % compared to the second and third cases.

In other words, reasonably planning the location and capacity of charging stations is important for development of the EV industry and the safe and stable operation of the power system. Considering the construction and maintenance of the charging station, the distribution network loss of the charging station, and the economic loss on the user side of the EV, this paper takes the node and capacity of charging station planning as control variables and the minimum cost of system comprehensive planning as objective function, and thus proposes a location and capacity planning model for the EV charging station. Based on the problems of low efficiency and insufficient global optimization ability of the current algorithm, the simulated annealing immune particle swarm optimization algorithm (SA-IPSO) is adopted in this paper. The simulated annealing algorithm is used in the global update of the particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the immune mechanism is introduced to participate in the iterative update of the particles, so as to improve the speed and efficiency of PSO. Voronoi diagram is used to divide service area of the charging station, and a joint solution process of Voronoi diagram and SA-IPSO is proposed. By example analysis, the results show that the optimal solution corresponding to the optimisation method proposed in this paper has a low overall cost, while the average charging waiting time is only 1.8 min and the charging pile utilisation rate is 75.5%. The simulation comparison verifies that the improved algorithm improves the operational efficiency by 18.1% and basically does not fall into local convergence. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Accordingly, the development of a home energy management system (HEMS) is urgently required to support residential consumers in consuming energy efficiently, achieving high satisfaction levels, and meeting grid specifications. Previous studies have only suggested simple HEMS models with one or two optimized objectives. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming paradigm for a comprehensive HEMS model which fully utilizes the vehicle-to-home and home-to-grid capabilities, while optimizing the energy cost, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), and discomfort index (DI). Also, an integration method of the augmented ɛ-constraint with lexicographic optimization is presented for effectively addressing any multi-objective HEMS problems. The proposed approach is validated across different simulations using both deterministic and stochastic models. The simulation results reveal that the energy costs and PAR can be reduced by 47.96% and 55.24%, respectively, whereas the DI is maintained at a minimum value. Extensive simulations related to the storage capacity, solar photovoltaic sizing, and uncertainty parameters are also analyzed.

The proposed solution was implemented and assessed using the Guangdong energy market as a case study through extensive simulation experiments.

A fuel cell system sub-model, a one-dimensional transient Li-ion battery sub-model, two direct current/direct current (DC/DC) sub-models as well as a vehicle load sub-model are integrated. The coupled heat and mass transfer processes are considered inside fuel cell system and Li-ion battery. After rigorous model validation, the overall performances under several typical China standard vehicle road conditions are investigated, including power distribution between different power units, battery state of charge (SOC), battery charge/discharge rate, fuel cell operating duration, temperature, and other key parameters. During the 100 km h−1 acceleration processes under the preliminary rule-based energy management strategy (EMS), the accelerated speed is found to be the largest in the beginning, resulting in the fact that the discharge power for battery increases sharply. The shorter the acceleration time, the larger the maximum power demand for Li-ion battery. During the combined 1300 s high-speed operating conditions under the on-off switch EMS, the total operating duration of fuel cell system is calculated to be about 531 s, and the total output power is calculated to be 11,556 kJ. In comparison, the vehicle saves about 1044 kJ energy and increases the fuel cell operation duration by 333.7% under the power-following EMS.

However, the increasing charging demand of EVs also brings challenges to future smart grids. To cope with the EV diffusion, this paper presents an adaptive fast charging station (FCS) strategy that considers the integrated network planning and quality of service (QoS) guarantee. First, based on the EV diffusion model and the proposed EV-integrated traffic assignment model, the charging demands at different regions and stages are forecasted. Based on the predicted spatial and temporal EV charging demand, a multistage stochastic distribution expansion planning model is presented, where the distribution network assets and FCSs are jointly considered. To guarantee the quality of the fast-charging services under EV diffusion, a QoS assessment is conducted based on the average waiting time and the average number of dissatisfied leaves. Finally, the proposed planning model allows several alternatives at both the distribution and transmission levels. The cost of electricity network expansion planning is considered as the adaptive cost arisen from the EV diffusion and the increase of the other electrical loads. We aim to find a planning strategy that can adapt to different penetration levels of EVs. The proposed framework and methodology are verified on the IEEE 24-bus power system encompassing 6 IEEE 33-bus distribution networks.

The cost function was considered as the sum of the investment, charging station electri cation, electric vehicle energy loss, and travel time costs. An intelligent algorithm-based approach was then employed to solve the planning problem of EVCS.

The paper investigates a novel approach of a convolutional neural network-based modeling method for estimating the spatial distribution of electric vehicles. The proposed model extracts features from multilayer socioeconomic input raster data that are sequenced in strides and outputs a spatial estimation of EV distribution. Spatial forecasting or area forecasting is at the core of the distribution system operators’ planning and development process as it provides a solid foundation for stochastic load modeling and load development analysis. Present models mostly focus on stochastic load modeling, lacking the spatial forecasting aspect of EV distribution. The proposed model aims to enhance EV load modeling by providing a more accurate spatial approach to the models. The study uses large actual socioeconomic and vehicle registration data sets to tackle the modeling challenge. In comparison with previous studies on similar topics, the present study benefits from more samples resulting from an increase in the adoption of electric vehicles. The proposed model architecture performs adequately in predicting a spatial electric vehicle distribution; the CNN model reached a weighted average precision score of 0.91. The proposed methodology greatly enhances stochastic EV load modeling by providing a good spatial forecast of the initial EV locations, and the results can be further aggregated to support the electricity distribution system planning process. An energy-, material-, and cost-efficient electricity distribution system is the backbone of the modern energy system. © 2022 The Author(s)","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Electric vehicle; Electricity distribution; Socioeconomics","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Electric vehicles; Forecasting; Spatial distribution; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Convolutional neural network; Electricity distribution; Electricity distribution systems; Energy systems; EVs loads; Load modeling; Planning process; Socio-economics; Stochastic load models; Convolution; algorithm; artificial neural network; distribution system; electric vehicle; energy planning; socioeconomic conditions; spatial distribution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140320073"

A model of an energy district and an optimization algorithm based on the economic parameters are presented and validated leveraging an existing energy district, simulating several scenarios depending on different economic conditions and technical parameters. The model of the energy district evaluates energy balances, distinguishing hydrogen and electrical energy flows; the districts can include an FCEV fleet, electrical loads, energy generators, storage system and an electrolyser for producing hydrogen from the green energy surplus produced in the district as well as drawing energy from the power distribution network. The algorithm, based on MILP, is used for optimizing the flows in the district; indeed, it evaluates all the technical and economic constraints at a certain timestamp and provides optimal scheduling of the energy units. Model and algorithm have been used to evaluate different scenarios that were identified by varying the economic parameters (i.e., prices of electrical energy and hydrogen) as well as district design (i.e., upgrading sizes of the generators and electrolysers). Energy district parameters have been identified exploiting real data collected in an existing district located in Terni (Italy) owned by the local multi-utility ASM Terni S.p.A. It already includes a fleet for waste management, PV plants, office buildings and warehouses. Through parameters combination, 1125 OPEX and 729 CAPEX simulated scenarios have been evaluated and reported; each scenario assesses the daily variation of variables' economic trends covering the timeframe from 2030 to 2050. Results of simulations highlight the most convenient economic contexts as well as the envisioned amount of expenditures for adopting FCEV in the presented district or similar ones.

This paper solves a stochastic multi-agent simulation-based model with the objective of minimizing the total cost of interdependent TN and PDN systems. Capturing the temporally dynamic inter-dependencies between the coupled networks, an equilibrium solution results in optimized system cost. In addition, the impact of large-scale EV integration into the PDN is assessed through the mutual coupling of both networks by solving the optimization problems, i.e., optimal EV routing using traffic assignment problem and optimal power flow using branch flow model. Previous works in the area of joint operation of TN and PDN networks fall short in considering the time-varying and dynamic nature of all effective parameters in the coupled TN and PDN system. In this paper, a Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE) network model is proposed to capture the optimal traffic distribution in TN as well as optimal power flow in PDN. A modified IEEE 30 bus system is adapted to a low voltage power network to examine the EV charging impact on the power grid. Our case study demonstrates the enhanced operation of the joint networks incorporating heterogeneous EV characteristics such as battery State of Charge (SoC), charging requests as well as PDN network’s marginal prices. The results of our simulations show how solving our defined coupled optimization problem reduces the total cost of the defined case study by 36% compared to the baseline scenario.

However, there are some constraints on operating the EV fleets as flexible energy storage for buildings, including (i) stochastic and limited availability of EVs for building energy management; and (ii) necessity of bi-directional flow of EVs to operate in both V2B and building-to-vehicle (B2V) modes. Hence, these constraints and the changing degree of electric energy exchange provided by the different numbers of EVs could affect the building energy management system and the dynamic energy usage. The main objectives of this paper are to study the optimal configurations of the number of EVs interacting with a building by examining (1) the impact of different numbers of EVs on the daily electricity bills in a grid-connected commercial building microgrid, (2) the range of allowable EV numbers that enable optimal V2B capacity and reasonable charging loads for enhancing the cost-effectiveness of building energy management; (3) the role of different EV numbers in affecting the required stationary battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity in an isolated commercial building microgrid. It is observed that optimal building connected EV numbers are determined by EV driving patterns, seasonal solar output, building demand profiles, and the price of grid electricity. Thus, a scenario analysis is conducted to determine a range of suitable EV numbers in each scenario. Simulation results indicate that the optimal number of EVs varies greatly between summer and winter, as well as across different solar irradiance scenarios. In a case study where a building's peak electric consumption is 30 kW and the PV system's rated capacity is 50 kW, the allowable EV number, depending on the amount of available solar energy, varies from 8 to 29 in summer and changes from 2 to 15 in winter. These results could be used to suggest the optimal EV numbers based on the day-ahead solar energy forecasting, enabling day-ahead planning to either attract more vehicle owners to boost V2B capacity or to limit the number of integrated EVs in order to avoid a spike in total EV charging demand. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage system; Electric vehicle; Energy management system; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-Building","Charging (batteries); Commercial vehicles; Cost effectiveness; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Office buildings; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery energy storage systems; Building energy managements; Commercial building; Day-ahead; Electric demand; Microgrid; Optimal integration; Renewable energies; Vehicle numbers; Vehicle-to-building; Energy management systems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138827565"

Therefore, in this paper, the cost model of EV DR and incremental cost rate (ICR) model of load response are established at first for solving the problems. Then, the ICR update criteria of agents are designed. Based on the criteria, an improved discrete-time leader-following consensus (IDTLFC) algorithm based on ICR is proposed. Also, the cooperative control method of EVs participating in DR based on the algorithm was presented. By employing the proposed algorithm, the method can calculate the ICR and response load value of agents. Likewise, the quick reduction of total system power offset and the completion of response load indicator can be achieved by utilizing the EV response layer to execute the response instructions. In the simulation experiments, the simulation model of multi-agent system based on EVs is established. The two system working modes of ”peak shaving and valley filling” (PSVF), plug-and-play characteristic of agents and so on are simulated. The results have shown that, when EV are linked to the grid and generate the power fluctuation, the total power balance and the stabilization of VCS could be kept with the method.

However, if EVs are used to assist the utility according to its demands, the scenario turns profitable. In this paper, a new methodology to schedule the EVs and distributed generation (DG) according to the DN system demand is proposed. The proposed method is a hybrid of the intelligent Q-learning algorithm, Loss Sensitivity factor (LSF), and Enhanced Grasshopper Optimization (EGOA) techniques. The main objective of this work is to encourage peak shaving, minimize the power loss and improve the voltage profile of overall DN in presence of EVs. The modelling of EVs is done by considering the most significant parameters such as EV State of Charge (EV SoC), travel itinerary, capacity of EV battery, and charging/discharging levels. Initially the location of EV charging stations and DGs are determined using LSF technique. Further peak shaving of DN considering EVs behaviour is implemented using Q-learning based smart charging method. Later the sizes of DGs are determined using EGOA technique. EGOA is an enhancement in the already existing grasshopper optimization technique that improves the algorithm's exploring capability. The hybrid approach helped in identifying the strong buses for EV charging station and DG placement. Further a peak shave of overall DN demand is achieved using Q-learning technique. Later using EGOA the DG sizing along with optimal EV placement helped in reduction of power loss by around 67% compared to base case. The voltage profile of DN is enhanced with the proposed hybrid approach without using compensation devices. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Distributed generation (DG); Electric vehicles (EVs); Enhanced grasshopper optimization (EGOA); Loss sensitivity factor (LSF)","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric losses; Electric vehicles; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Distributed generation; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging; Enhanced grasshopper optimization; Loss sensitivity factor; Optimisations; Optimization techniques; Powerloss; Q-learning; Sensitivity factors; Distributed power generation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137565789"

In this paper, a model based non-cooperative game theory is developed to optimize the capacity configuration problem with wind power, PV power, and electric vehicles (EVs). The model is integrated with economic factors, such as electricity sales income, investments, and power supply reliability costs. An iterative search algorithm is used to solve the proposed game model, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to optimize the income of each player. Mixed integer multi-objective linear programming (MIMLP) is used to establish the representative days selection model of resources and load demands. To verify the rationality of the model, the grid-connected hybrid power generation system with different game participants and line transmission capacities was studied. Furthermore, the representative days results of the daily load rate and peak valley ratio generated by MIMLP are compared with those obtained using k-means clustering and a scenario reduction method. The results reveal that the proposed model and related strategies can realize a reasonable allocation of resources and effectively improve the operation economy of power systems. © 2022","Capacity configuration; Game theory; Hybrid power systems; Representative days","Economics; Electric power systems; Game theory; Integer programming; Iterative methods; K-means clustering; Linear programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Wind power; Capacity configuration; Game-theoretic; Hybrid power; Hybrid power system; Mixed integer; Multi-objective linear programming; Photovoltaic power; Photovoltaics; Representative days; Sizing optimization; Investments","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61873292 , in part by the Key Scientific Research Projects in Colleges and Universities of Henan Province under Grant 22ZX011 and 20A470019 , and in part by the Young Backbone Teacher in Colleges and Universities of Henan Province under Grant 2018GGJS104 .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135502945"

This research presents a two-stage optimization strategy, for improving the economic and environment-friendly operation of MG considering EVs integration. In Stage 1, model of EVs under coordinate charging/discharging stimulated by time-of-use incentive mechanism is established, and the peak–valley hours are dynamically divided to obtain a load curve with minimized peak-to-valley difference (PVD). In Stage 2, aiming for the best tradeoff between the generation cost and pollutant emission, daily optimal scheduling of the MG generators is efficiently calculated according to the varying power demand. For enhancing the convergence, an advanced genetic algorithm with elite preservation strategy is employed. Two cases from a residential MG system is exploited to validate the proposed method, and the results show that firstly the power supply pressure could be obviously relieved owing to the load shifting effect of the coordinated vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service reflected by the decreased PVD (Case 1: from 76.16 to 54.35 kW, Case 2: from 76.25 to 46.19 kW); simultaneously, via applicable power planning of the MG components, cost saving and emission reduction can be both achieved (Case 1: ¥190.12 under V2G management compared to ¥281.66 under basic load, Case 2: ¥177.28 compared to ¥350.24), ensuring the feasibility of the control strategy, which promotes the economic-environmental and reliable operation of the MG system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Economic-environmental dispatch; Electric vehicles; Load shifting; Microgrid; Vehicle-to-grid","Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Genetic algorithms; Scheduling; Economic/environmental dispatches; Electric vehicle integrations; Energy internet; Large-scales; Load shifting; Microgrid; Microgrid systems; Scheduling problem; Two stage optimizations; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle-to-grid","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China ( 2017JJ5044 ), Scientific Research Foundation of Hunan Provincial Education Department, China ( 20C0613 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 51404103 , 51574117 and 61376073 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135417339"

Traditional user behavior analysis methods based on model-driven and causal analysis have the disadvantages of strong subjectivity and physical models that are difficult to deal with the randomness and uncertainty of user behavior in complex grid environments. In this paper, we use unsupervised learning methods to analyze user behavior in complex power grid environments, and propose user behavior analysis methods based on stacked autoencoder and clustering. We first reduce the complexity of user behavior data by proposing adaptive feature selection algorithm of user behavior based on stacked autoencoder and unsupervised learning (AFS-SAEUL). Finally, we build a user behavior analysis model based on adaptive feature selection and improved clustering (UBA-AFSIC). The model improved the performance of unsupervised classification of user behavior by fusing the adaptive generation strategy of the initial cluster centers. The simulation experiment results on two real electricity datasets and one public electric vehicle charging dataset show that compared with the existing feature selection algorithm and clustering algorithm, the algorithms proposed in this paper have higher feature selection rate and better clustering performance. © 2022 IEEE.","electric vehicle charging behavior analysis; Feature selection; power consumption behavior analysis; stacked autoencoder; unsupervised learning","Behavioral research; Clustering algorithms; Coordination reactions; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Feature extraction; Smart power grids; Uncertainty analysis; Unsupervised learning; Auto encoders; Behavior analysis; Correlation; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging behavior analyse.; Features extraction; Features selection; Load modeling; Power consumption behavior analyse; Power demands; Power grids; Stacked autoencoder; Electric power utilization","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51977113, Grant 91746209, and Grant 61972212; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20190089; in part by the BAGUI Scholar Program of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China under Grant 201979; and in part by the Science Foundation of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunication (NUPTSF), China under Grant NY219095.

For this reason, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained more significance in the transportation sector owing to their efficient and clean operation chance. These improvements, however, bring new challenges such as installation costs, infrastructure renovation, and loading of the existing power system. Here, optimal sizing and siting of EV charging stations (CSs) are examined in a mixed-integer linear programming framework with the aim of minimizing the number of EVCSs in the distribution system (which in turn means to minimize CS-related investment while satisfying EV owners' needs) while satisfying constraints. The proposed optimization model considers EVCS types with different charging rate capabilities to provide opportunities for demand-side management. Moreover, the model takes the actual behaviour of the battery charging pattern into account by using real measured EV charging data together with the consideration of an actual distribution system belonging to a region in Turkey. Lastly, a bunch of case studies is conducted in order to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the devised model. © 2022 The Authors.

The electric vehicle’s load impacts the distribution system’s performance as the electric vehicle’s adoption rises. As a result, the distribution system’s dependability depends on the precise location of the electric vehicle charging station (EVCS). The main challenge is the deteriorating impact of the distribution system caused by the incorrect placement of the charging station. The distribution system is integrated with the charging station in conjunction with the distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) and distributed generation (DG) to reduce the impact of the EVCS. This paper presents a fuzzy classified method for optimal sizings and placements of EVCSs, DGs, and DSTATCOMs for 69-bus radial distribution systems using the RAO-3 algorithm. The characteristic curves of Li-ion batteries were utilized for the load flow analysis to develop models for EV battery charging loads. The prime objective of the proposed method is to (1) Reduce real power loss; (2) Enhance the substation (SS) power factor (pf); (3) Enhance the distribution network’s voltage profile; and (4) Allocate the optimum number of vehicles at the charging stations. The proposed fuzzified RAO-3 algorithm improves the substation pf in the distribution system. The fuzzy multi-objective function is utilized for the two stages and simultaneous placements of the EVCS, DG, and DSTATCOM. The simulation results reveal that the simultaneous placement method performs better, due to the significant reduction in real power loss, improved voltage profile, and the optimum number of EVs. Moreover, the existing system performances for increased EV and distribution system loads are presented. © 2022 by the authors.","distributed generators; distribution static compensator; distribution system; electric vehicles; power factor","Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Lithium-ion batteries; Static synchronous compensators; Vehicle performance; Charging station; Distributed generators; Distribution static compensator; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Optimal placements; Optimum number; Power factors; Real power loss; Voltage profile; Electric vehicles","Woosong University’s Academic Research Funding—2022.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142713372"

This paper goes beyond existing literature by investigating the impact of planning mechanisms in smart grid planning frameworks when considering the allocation of PV distributed generation units, battery energy storage systems, capacitor banks, and electric vehicle charging station facilities. First, a single- and multi-objective planning problem is formulated. Then, we propose a novel adaptive-dynamic planning mechanism that uses a recombination technique to find optimal allocation variables of multiple DER and FACTS types. To cope with the additional complexity resulting from the expanded solution space, we develop a hybrid stochastic optimizer, named cooperative spiral genetic algorithm with differential evolution (CoSGADE) optimization scheme, to produce optimal allocation solution variables.

The optimal RES sizing is revisited to examine the influence of EV penetration percentages and charging rates (normal, medium, and fast) and optimize the charging periods to reduce system capacity. The results showed that for typical nighttime charging and relatively smaller EV penetrations, the RES system capacity remains the same, but the size of ESS must be increased by up to 16.67% for 25% EV penetration. As EV penetration increases, the required ESS capacity drops slightly, but the RES capacity increases by up to 24.53% for 100% EV penetration. Optimal charging periods were found to be during morning hours (6:00 to 9:00 a.m.). Adopting these early charging hours and compared to 0% EV, the required ESS capacity remained nearly the same, except for smaller EV penetration percentages. However, for 100% EV penetration, the increase in required capacity ranged from 24.5% for fast charging to 50.01% for normal charging. For lower penetration percentages, the three modes of charging resulted in comparable capacities of ESS and RES. As the penetration percentage increased to 100%, the fast charging mode required considerably lower RES capacity (by 17.0%) and the same ESS capacity of the 0% EV penetration. © 2022 The Authors.","Electric vehicles; Energy transition plan; Green transportation; Jordan; Renewable energy system; Techno-economic feasibility","Charging (batteries); Developing countries; Electric power transmission networks; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; Energy systems; Energy transition plan; Energy transitions; Green transportations; Jordan; Renewable energies; Renewable energy system; Techno-economic feasibility; Transition plan; Vehicle penetration; Renewable energy resources","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141167336"

As electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs; e.g., wind and solar power) have become integrated into the power system, the UC problem has become increasingly complex. With the continuous growth of the proportion of renewable energy based on wind and solar energy in the power supply structure on the supply side in the future, the random characteristics of the supply and demand sides of the power system will become more obvious, which will inevitably bring about the safety, stability and economic operation of the power system.The system. The study of UC not only has great academic value, but also has important practical significance.The significance. The optimal scheduling of UC, including thermal, wind, solar, and EV power units was investigated. The objective function of optimal scheduling was to minimize the operating cost of the unit and optimize the charging and discharging costs of EVs. In view of power generation characteristics of RESs, an interval number was introduced to describe the uncertainties in the outputs of wind and solar power generation. The enhanced-interval linear programming is introduced to deal with the UC problem including EVs and uncertainty of RES. For better accuracy, wind power was considered for each of the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) and solar power was divided into sunny, cloudy, and rainy conditions. To reflect the influence of EV charging and discharging on UC, three different charging and discharging pricing schemes were considered. Various scenarios were simulated using the CPLEX solver. The results showed that costs can be affected by season and climate. The interval number solution sets of the total cost and of the charging and unit costs were obtained by using interval number theory to describe the uncertainty of output in RESs; this provides a new approach for solving the UC optimization problem by integrating RESs. The charging and discharging of EVs can also affect costs. By encouraging the orderly charging and discharging of EVs, power load fluctuations could be reduced and peak-load shifting could be achieved. Different pricing schemes had different impacts on cost. The pricing scheme can not only effectively reduce the charging cost borne by EV owners, but could also make EVs profitable. This discovery provides a theoretical basis for guidance on the charging and discharging of EVs through charge and discharge price schemes. The simulation results reflect the relationship between economic cost and seasons/climate and confirm the suitability of using an interval number to describe uncertainty in energy generation. © 2022 The Author(s)","Electric vehicles; Enhanced-interval linear programming; Interval number; Renewable energy sources","Cost reduction; Integer programming; Linear programming; Natural resources; Number theory; Scheduling; Solar energy; Solar energy conversion; Solar power generation; Wind power; Enhanced-interval linear programming; Interval linear programming; Interval number; Optimal scheduling; Power; Pricing scheme; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty; Unit Commitment; Unit-commitment problems; Electric vehicles","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Pan jian reports financial support was provided by Huai’an Municipal Science and Technology Bureau.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140142916"

However, they require advanced off-grid microgrid capacity planning optimisation models to achieve the globally optimum sizing results. In this context, while considerable attention has been devoted to a range of off-grid microgrid sizing methods, leveraging the potential of metaheuristic optimisation algorithms is less well-explored. Furthermore, there is a general lack of electrified transportation interventions considered during long-term grid-independent microgrid planning phases. In response, this paper introduces a novel metaheuristic-based strategic off-grid microgrid capacity planning optimisation model that is applicable to associated integrated energy and e-mobility resource planning problems. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, three independent microgrid development projects have been considered for three communities residing on Aotea–Great Barrier Island in Aotearoa–New Zealand. The sites of interest have different demand profiles and renewable energy potentials – with consequent changes in the technologies considered in the associate candidate pools. Moreover, to generate key insights into the impact of the forecast uncertainty of different variables on the costing and configuration of the associated microgrids, a number of scenario analyses have been performed. In addition, the numeric simulation results and the associated capital budgeting analyses have demonstrated the economic viability of the project proposals formulated based on the proposed off-grid microgrid planning method, especially with controlling the charging of electric vehicles. Particularly, the potential of the artificial hummingbird algorithm in reducing the total discounted costs of off-grid microgrids by at least ∼6% has been shown. Also, the importance of electric vehicle charging coordination in reducing the off-grid microgrid costs (by at least ∼9%) has been substantiated. © 2022 The Authors","Metaheuristics; Microgrids; Off-grid; Optimal planning; Optimal sizing; Optimisation","Budget control; Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Microgrids; Renewable energy resources; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Capacity planning; Metaheuristic; Micro-grid planning; Microgrid; Off-grids; Optimal planning; Optimal sizing; Optimisations; Optimization models; Uncertainty quantifications; Optimization","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137337942"

Therefore, it is significant to predict the charging load of EVs to solve the challenges of power system planning and operation. The Monte Carlo (MC) method is preferred by many scholars in EV charging load prediction because it is very suitable for describing random characteristics with a good prediction effect. To obtain more reliable and efficient prediction results, this paper analyzes the application of parallel computing technology in MC simulation. Firstly, EVs in the region are classified according to their battery capacity. Based on the voltage change curve of lithium-ion power batteries in the process of constant current charging under different capacities, the charging power, charging time, and state of charge (SOC) of EVs are investigated. Secondly, the behavior characteristics of users and the driving parameter characteristics of EVs are studied respectively, and the probability distribution model of multi-source information is established. Thirdly, parallel computing technology in the computer field is introduced, and an improved MC method is proposed based on the multi-core CPU architecture. After fully considering the complex constant current charging process after fitting, the charging load of EVs in a region of East China is simulated. Finally, the time cost and the load forecasting results of serial and parallel methods are compared and analyzed, and the progressiveness and effectiveness of the parallel method are verified. Results show that the charging load has four peaks in a day, taxis are the main source of the peak load of the power grid, the charging load of buses fluctuates the most, and private cars are the main backup capacity to participate in V2G dispatching in the future. In addition, under the experimental conditions set in this paper, compared with the traditional serial MC method, the improved MC method based on parallel computing shows good performance with the acceleration effect improved by 7 to 12 times. © 2022 The Author(s)","Constant current charging process; Electric vehicle; Load forecasting; Monte Carlo method; Parallel computing","Charging (batteries); Electric load dispatching; Electric power plant loads; Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Lithium-ion batteries; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging loads; Charging process; Computing technology; Constant current charging; Constant current charging process; Electric vehicle charging; Load forecasting; MonteCarlo methods; Parallel com- puting; Parallel method; Electric vehicles","This work is supported by the Jiangsu Province Postgraduate Practice Innovation Program, China : “Regional electric vehicle load forecasting based on parallel computing and multi-source information” (No. SJCX22_1079 ).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136262881"

The first stage of the suggested framework focuses on the economic operation planning of EHS. The operator of EHS handles the uncertainty of market prices and renewable resources to provide the primary scheduling from the economic point of view. In the second stage, the primary scheduling of EHS has been modified to enhance the thermal and electrical flexibility in order to cover the existing uncertainties. Increasing system flexibility is achieved by increasing system reservation, but maximizing flexibility should not lead to a lack of energy for consumers. Therefore, the third stage evaluates the operation scheduling of EHS from the electrical and thermal energy not supplied perspective. Also, the plug-in electric vehicle, electric storage, thermal storage, ice storage, electrical and thermal demand response programs are integrated into EHS to enhance the system flexibility.

Planning at the distribution level is limited by the complexities of optimizing unbalanced systems. In this paper we develop a three-phase infeasibility analysis that identifies weak locations in a distribution network. This optimization is formulated by adding slack current sources at nodes in the system and minimizing their norm subject to distribution power flow constraints. Through this analysis we solve instances of power flow that would otherwise be infeasible and diverge. Under conditions when power flow is feasible, our approach is equivalent to standard three-phase power flow; however, for cases where power flow fails, the nonzero slack injection currents compensate for missing power to make the grid feasible. Since an uncountable number of injected currents can provide feasibility, we further explore the optimization formulation that best fits the solution objective through use of both a least squares and an L1 norm objective. Our L1 norm formulation localizes power deficient locations through its inherent sparsity. We show the efficacy of this approach on realistic unbalanced testcases up to 8500 nodes and for a scenario with a high penetration of electric vehicles. © 2022","Distribution system; Equivalent circuit approach; L1-norm sparse solution; Nonlinear optimization; Three-phase unbalanced networks","Electric load flow; Energy resources; Nonlinear programming; Timing circuits; Distribution systems; Equivalent circuit approach; L1 norm; L1-norm sparse solution; Non-linear optimization; Power flows; Sparse solutions; Three phase; Three phasis; Three-phase unbalanced network; Equivalent circuits","This work was sponsored in part by the National Science Foundation under contract ECCS-1800812 .","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134774553"

New forms of power generation coupled with storage and the presence of new, increasingly flexible loads such as electric vehicles enable the development of multi-agent planning systems based on new forms of interaction. For instance, consumers can take advantage of flexibility by interacting directly with the grid or through aggregators that bridge the gap between these end-users and traditional centralised markets. This paper aims to provide insight into the benefits for aggregators and end-users from a financial perspective by proposing a methodology that can be applied to different scenarios. End-users may provide flexibility services related to private vehicle charging stations or battery storage systems. The paper will analyse different remuneration levels for end-users by highlighting the most beneficial scenarios for aggregators and end-users and providing evidence on potential conflict of interests. The numerical results show that some consumers may benefit more from aggregation. This is because if taken individually, consumption habits do not allow the same flexibility when considering clusters of consumers with different behaviour. It is also shown that there are cases in which consumers do not seem to benefit from the presence of intermediate parties.

In distributed systems, DGs and utility-owned electric vehicle (EV) to grid aggregators have to be efficiently scaled for cost-effective network operation. Accordingly, with the penetration of power systems, demand response (DR) is considered an advanced step towards a smart grid. To cope with these advancements, this study aims to develop an innovative solution for the day-ahead sizing approach of energy storage systems of EVs parking lots and DGs in smart distribution systems complying with DR and minimizing the pertinent costs. The unique feature of the proposed approach is to allow interactive customers to participate effectively in power systems. To accurately solve this optimization model, two probabilistic self-adjusted modified particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) algorithms are developed and compared for minimizing the total operational costs addressing all constraints of the distribution system, DG units, and energy storage systems of EV parking lots. The K-means clustering and the Naive Bayes approach are utilized to determine the EVs that are ready to participate efficiently in the DR program. The obtained results on the IEEE-24 reliability test system are compared to the genetic algorithm and the conventional PSO to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithms. The results show that the first SAPSO algorithm outperforms the algorithms in terms of minimizing the total running costs. The finding demonstrates that the proposed near-optimal day-ahead scheduling approach of DG units and EV energy storage systems in a simultaneous manner can effectively minimize the total operational costs subjected to generation constraints complying with DR. © 2022 The Authors.

However, smart management of PEVs in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system can result in benefits to the grid such as load leveling, and cost reduction. This paper proposes a unit commitment model for a V2G system connected to a smart power grid. The model considers different penetration levels of PEVs and investigates the economic and technical effects of using PEVs to support the grid. The proposed methodology incorporates controlled charging and discharging as well as accounting for battery degradation in the unit commitment problem. The model is tested using an IEEE 24 bus network to determine the impact of high PEV penetration on generation cost. A comparison between a system without V2G and a system with V2G is presented to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach. The results show that the optimal scheduling of PEVs leads to reduction in generation cost and is effective in leveling the load profile through valley filling and peak load reduction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Economic dispatch; Plug-in electric vehicles; Power systems; Unit commitment; Vehicle-to-grid","Cost reduction; Electric load dispatching; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Plug-in electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Economic Dispatch; Generation cost; Grid operation; Optimal vehicles; Power; Power system; Smart grid; Unit Commitment; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle to grids; Scheduling","This work was partially funded by the National Science Foundation award #1711767.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129331654"

Next, simultaneously considered as constraints, the traffic network and power distribution network are coupled and the route planning model is integrated into the load restoration model to realize the spatio-temporal scheduling of EVs. The load recovery, the power distribution network economy, and EV driving cost are taken into consideration at the same time.

However, the use behaviors of private EVs have not been well understood, in part due to the lack of proper datasets. This paper used a unique dataset containing trajectories of over 76,000 private EVs (accounting for 68% of the private EV fleet) in Beijing to uncover trip, parking and charging patterns of private EVs, so as to better inform policy making and infrastructure planning for different EV-related stakeholders, including planners, vehicle manufacturers, and power grid and infrastructure companies. We conducted both statistical and spatiotemporal analyses. In terms of statistical patterns, most of the EV trip distances (over 71%) were shorter than 15 km. Also, most of parking events (around 76%) lasted for less than 1 h. From a spatial perspective, the densities of trip Origins and Destinations (ODs), parking events and charging events in the central districts tended to be much higher than those of the other districts. Furthermore, the number of intra-district trips tended to be much higher than the number of inter-district trips. In terms of temporal trip patterns, there were two peak periods on working days: a morning peak period from 7 to 9 AM, and an afternoon peak period from 5 to 7 PM; On non-working days, there was only one peak period from 9 AM to 5 PM; while the temporal charging patterns on working and non-working days had a similar trend: most of EV drivers got their EVs charged overnight. Finally, we demonstrated how to apply the observed statistical and spatiotemporal patterns into policy making (i.e., time-of-use tariff) and infrastructure planning (i.e., deployment of normal charging posts, enroute fast charging stations and vehicle-to-grid enabled infrastructures). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Charging patterns; Electric vehicle; Parking patterns; Spatiotemporal analysis; Trajectory data; Trip patterns","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Public policy; Trajectories; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging patterns; Infrastructure planning; Parking pattern; Peak period; Policy making; Spatiotemporal analysis; Statistical pattern; Trajectories datum; Travel patterns; Trip patterns; Decision making; data set; electric vehicle; parking; spatiotemporal analysis; transportation planning; travel behavior; travel demand; Beijing [China]; China","This work was supported by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University [1-BE2J], and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52002345; 52072025).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111689124"

One of the foremost problems is the charging–discharging processes of EV batteries with diverse characteristics. Although a charging station is the first choice in this regard, a battery swap station (BSS) is also a suitable alternative solution as it eliminates long waiting periods and battery degradation due to fast charging. BSS has the capability to ensure prompt and efficient service for electric vehicles. Since BSS has a large number of battery systems, optimum planning of the charging–discharging operations of the batteries is critical for both BSS and the grid. This study presents an optimal charging–discharging schedule for multiple BSSs based on the swap demand of privately owned EVs and electric bus (EB) public transportation system. In addition, BSSs reinforce the power grid by providing ancillary services such as peak shaving and valley filling with demand response programs. In order to increase the flexibility of the operation, the mobile swapping station (MSS) concept, an innovative and dynamic service, is introduced to the literature and added to the model. The results indicate that BSS is an essential agent in the ancillary services market and the MSS concept is a yielding solution for both BSSs and power networks.

Furthermore, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and other passive electronic units are adopted to improve grid performance and mitigate the effects of high variability from RE power. Hence, planning frameworks are developed to optimally allocate these units to distribution networks. However, current planning mechanisms do not consider the relative effect of different allocated units in planning frameworks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel comprehensive planning framework for allocating DG units, BESS units, and Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) facilities in a distribution network while optimizing its technical, economic, and environmental benefits. The proposed framework uses a recombination technique to generate more solutions by dynamically updating the DG and BESS units’ locations in one iteration. A Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based algorithm is introduced to coordinate EV charging that suggests the optimal EVCS location in relation to other units’ locations. To cope with the complexity ensuing from searching a larger solution space, a multi-stage, hybrid optimization scheme is developed to produce optimal allocation variables. A category-based multiobjective framework is further developed to simultaneously optimize many objective functions — power loss, voltage stability, voltage deviation, installation and operation cost, and emission cost. Through numerical simulations on the IEEE 33- and 118-bus distribution network, it is shown that the proposed optimization scheme achieves higher metric values than the adopted benchmark optimization schemes. A validation process was also carried out on the proposed multiobjective optimization approach, comparing it with other approaches. Using the Spacing metric, the proposed approach proves to be efficient, depicting a good spread of Pareto optimal solutions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage systems; Distributed generation; Electric vehicle charging station; Electric vehicles; Hybrid optimization algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto optimal solutions; Reinforcement learning","Battery management systems; Battery storage; Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Distributed power generation; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Location; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Reinforcement learning; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Charging station; Distribution generation; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Hybrid optimization algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; Pareto optimal solutions; Planning framework; Reinforcement learnings; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy resource; optimization","This research was partially supported by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria, South Africa, through the Smart Networks collaboration initiative and IoT-Factory Programme (Funded by the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), South Africa ), and partially funded by National Research Foundation, South Africa ( 114626 , 112248 , and 129311 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132922336"

EVs and VRE are integrated in a production cost model with a 5 min time resolution and multiple planning horizons to deduce the effects of variable generation and EV charging on system operating costs, EV charging costs, dispatch stacks, reserves and VRE curtailment. EV penetration scenarios of the light-duty vehicle fleet of 10%, 20%, and 30% are considered in the RTS-GMLC test system, and VRE penetration is 34% of annual energy consumption. The impacts of EVs are investigated during the annual peak in the summer and during the four weeks of the year in which high VRE and low loads lead to overgeneration. Uncoordinated and coordinated EV charging scenarios are considered. In the uncoordinated scenario, charging is undertaken at the convenience of the EV owners, modeled using data from the Idaho National Laboratory’s EV Project. Coordinated charging uses an “aggregator” model, wherein EV charging is scheduled to minimize operating costs while meeting the daily charging requirements subject to EV availability and charging constraints. The results show that at each EV penetration level, the uncoordinated charging costs were higher than the coordinated charging costs. During a high-VRE, low-load week, with uncoordinated EV charging at 30% penetration (3% energy penetration), the peak load increased by as much as 27%. Using coordinated charging, the EV load shifts to hours with low prices, coincident with either low load, high VRE, or both. Furthermore, coordinated charging substantially reduces the curtailment of PV by as much as nine times during the low-load seasons, and the curtailment of wind generation by more than half during the summer peak season, compared to the scenarios with no EVs and uncoordinated EV charging. Using a production cost model with multiple planning cycles, load and VRE forecasts, and a “look ahead” period during scheduling and dispatching units was crucial in creating and utilizing the flexibility of coordinated EV charging. © 2022 by the authors.","EV charging; overgeneration; power system operation; production cost modeling; VRE curtailment","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166261671"

This raises the necessity of modeling stochastic and flexible energy resources in power system operation. However, some distributed energy resources have both stochasticity and flexibility, e.g., prosumers with distributed photovoltaics and energy storage, and plug-in electric vehicles with stochastic charging behavior and demand response capability. Such partly controllable participants pose challenges to modeling the aggregate behavior of large numbers of entities in power system operation. This paper proposes a new perspective on the aggregate modeling of such energy resources in power system operation. Specifically, a unified controllability-uncontrollability-decomposed model for various energy resources is established by modeling the controllable and uncontrollable parts of energy resources separately. Such decomposition enables the straightforward aggregate modeling of massive energy resources with different controllabilities by integrating their controllable components with linking constraints and uncontrollable components with dependent discrete convolution. Furthermore, a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model based on the proposed model for power system operation is established. The proposed model is tested using a three-bus system and real Qinghai provincial power grid of China. The result shows that this model is able to characterize at high accuracy the aggregate behavior of massive energy resources with different levels of controllability so that their flexibility can be fully explored. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.","Aggregation; dependent discrete convolution; flexibility; stochastic unit commitment; virtual power plant","Aggregates; Controllability; Convolution; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Photovoltaic effects; Plug-in electric vehicles; Stochastic models; Vehicle-to-grid; Virtual Power Plants; Aggregate behavior; Aggregate model; Dependent discrete convolution; Discrete convolution; Flexibility; Power; Power system operations; Stochastic unit commitments; Stochastics; Virtual power plants; Stochastic systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139545999"

Charging electric vehicles (EVs) from renewable energy systems (RES) substantially avoids the side effects of using fossil fuels. The higher the increase in the number of EVs the greater the challenge to the reliability of the conventional power system. Increasing charging connections for EVs to the power system may cause serious problems to the power system, such as voltage fluctuations, contingencies in transmission lines, and loss increases. This paper introduces a novel strategy to not only replace the drawbacks of the EV charging stations on the power system’s stability and reliability, but also to enhance the power system’s performance. This improvement can be achieved using a smart demand side management (DSM) strategy and vehicle to grid (V2G) concepts. The use of DSM increases the correlation between the loads and the available generation from the RES. Besides this, the use of DSM, and the use of V2G concepts, also helps in adding a backup for the power system by consuming surplus power during the high generation period and supplying stored energy to the power system during shortage in generation. The IEEE 30 bus system was used as an example of an existing power system where each load busbar was connected to a smart EV charging station (SEVCS). The performance of the system with and without the novel DSM and V2G concepts was compared to validate the superiority of the concepts in improving the performance of the power system. The use of modified particle swarm optimization in optimal sizing and optimal load flow reduced the cost of energy and the losses of the power system. The use of the smart DSM and V2G concepts substantially improved the voltage profile, the transmission line losses, the fuel cost of conventional power systems, and the stability of the power system. © 2022 by the authors.","demand response; electric vehicles; hybrid; particle swarm optimization; renewable; sizing; smart charging station","Charging (batteries); Demand side management; Electric lines; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Global warming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; System stability; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging station; Demand response; Hybrid; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Renewable; Sizing; Smart charging; Smart charging station; Swarm optimization; Fossil fuels","This work was supported by the King Saud University, Saudi Arabia, Deanship of Scientific research, Research Chair Saudi Electricity Company Chair in Power System Reliability and Security.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138859191"

The influx of E-mobility may require an increase in grid reinforcements, but these can be reduced and optimized by a combination of new technologies, tools, and strategies, such as the deployment of solar PV generation integrated with aggregated energy storage systems. One of the challenges in the implementation of charging infrastructures in public stations is coupling the projected sizes of energy demand and power requirements in each location for each charger. This paper describes a method to estimate projected values for energy consumption and power demand in EV fast charging stations (CS).

This paper proposes a bi-level planning and operation framework that determines the optimal locations of EVCS and scheduling of EVs to reduce peak load and network congestion in low voltage distribution networks by considering uncertain EV and distribution network behavior. Planning of EVCS is performed to minimize voltage deviations and distribution network losses. The priority-based scheduling algorithm uses the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) technology to charge the EVs during high priority periods to meet the user requirements and discharge during low or medium priority periods to reduce the peak load and thermal overloading in distribution feeders. Based on an Australian scenario, the proposed method has been tested on the IEEE low voltage test feeder. Uncoordinated scheduling of EVs is also implemented and compared with the proposed strategy. The results show that installing EVCS at the optimal locations can reduce the network losses and voltage deviations by 39.38 per cent and 15.32 per cent, respectively. It is also shown that the proposed scheduling of EVs can reduce the peak load of distribution substations and lower the network congestion without affecting the EV charging requirements. With a 55 percent penetration of EVs, the peak load and thermal overload in distribution lines are reduced by 20.53 per cent and 5.88 per cent, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Congestion management; Control strategy; Electric vehicles; Network losses; Peak shaving; Voltage deviation","Charging (batteries); Electric discharges; Electric losses; Electric power transmission networks; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Traffic congestion; Vehicle-to-grid; Voltage distribution measurement; Bi-level planning; Charging station; Congestions managements; Control strategies; Electric vehicle charging; Network loss; Peak load; Peak-shaving; Planning and scheduling; Voltage deviations; Electric vehicles","Funding text 1: Daoyi Dong is currently a Scientia Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia.

One of the most effective alternatives to mitigate pollution is to promote green mobility via electric vehicles. However, the lack of electric charging stations may decrease individuals’ satisfaction to use electric vehicles in daily life. To bridge the gaps, this paper aims to simultaneously allocate electric vehicle charging stations and smart photovoltaic inverters in distribution networks to optimize three important objective functions, including power loss, voltage deviation, and voltage unbalance factor. To solve such a multi-objective optimization problem, a novel hybrid fuzzy Pareto dominance concept with differential evolution algorithm is proposed. A scenario-based framework is also used to capture the uncertainties of the model comprising loads, PVs’ generation and the demand of electric vehicle charging stations. The effectiveness of the stochastic multi-objective approach is then examined and verified on an unbalanced 37-bus network under different case studies. Attained results illustrate that if smart photovoltaic inverters integrate into the network with charging stations, the network performance is significantly improved, such as keeping voltage unbalance factor under standard value accounting for two percent. © 2022","Electric vehicle; multi-objective optimization; smart PV inverters; unbalanced distribution networks; unbalanced voltage compensation","Charging (batteries); Electric inverters; Electric losses; Electric vehicles; Evolutionary algorithms; Stochastic systems; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Photovoltaic inverters; Smart PV inverter; Unbalanced distribution networks; Unbalanced voltage compensation; Unbalanced voltages; Voltage compensation; Multiobjective optimization; alternative energy; electric vehicle; network analysis; optimization; photovoltaic system; solar power; stochasticity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133372808"

This can be alleviated by using flexible resources on the demand side to provide ancillary services at various timescales (e.g., day-ahead planning or real-time operation). However, practitioners lack a unified framework for measuring energy flexibility in the real-time operation frame. This study considers a control structure for clustered commuter plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in an office building with both day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch and proposes a generic quantification framework for assessing the capability of PEVs to manage the uncertainties of photovoltaic output and inflexible building load. Our evaluation considered the flexibility shortage in terms of power, energy, and control strategy, and the Monte Carlo method was used for probabilistic analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify the key factors determining real-time flexibility. The results suggest that 1.5–2 times the number of PEVs is required to meet the defined level of real-time flexibility rather than planning flexibility. Possible conflicts in flexibility enhancement at different timescales and directions were observed under various day-ahead scheduling strategies; prediction information can be used to mitigate conflicts in scheduling strategies and improve the overall control performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Day-ahead scheduling; Demand response; Electric vehicle; Flexibility evaluation; Real-time dispatch; Uncertainty modeling","Charging (batteries); Electric load dispatching; Monte Carlo methods; Office buildings; Real time systems; Scheduling; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Day-ahead scheduling; Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexibility evaluation; Photovoltaics; Real- time; Real-time dispatch; Real-time operation; Time-scales; Uncertainty models; Plug-in electric vehicles; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electricity; photovoltaic system; sensitivity analysis; Argentina; Monaco; Monte; Monte Carlo","Support for this study was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 51838007) and Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132586856"

The health of power system components and the satisfaction of electric vehicle users are becoming equally important with the increasing presence of electric vehicles on the power grid. The charging strategy is crucial as it plays a significant role in shaping users’ behavior to deal with the adverse effects of electric vehicles on grid components. There is a lack of a proper unified framework for the charging management, which considers both the system perspectives such as transformer overloading, shortage of power, and users perspectives such as satisfaction, charging urgency, and privacy. This paper presents a fully decentralized cooperative approach/strategy for charging electric vehicles. The solution is achieved by developing a decentralized iterative algorithm based on a consensus concept to protect the privacy of EV owners. The charging priority factor is incorporated to address the charging urgency of electric vehicles. Multiple electric vehicles can be charged simultaneously without a central decision-maker or coordinator using the proposed strategy. As a result, electric vehicles fulfill their charging needs by the deadline to maximize user satisfaction while respecting their constraints and limitations imposed by the available charging power and charging station capacity. The convergence of the proposed approach is demonstrated by observing the charging of multiple electric vehicles. The results are benchmarked against the centralized approach to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Charging management; Cooperative approach; Decentralized approach; Electric vehicles; Peer-to-peer communication","Charging (batteries); Cooperative communication; Decision making; Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging managements; Cooperative approach; Decentralised; Decentralized approach; Electric vehicle charging; Operation of power system; Peer-to-peer communications; Power grids; Power system components; Vehicle users; Iterative methods","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the funding and continuous support offered by MITACS Inc.

Traditional approaches see urban regeneration projects as independent processes with respect to the energy planning ones, ignoring the European Union targets to move towards the energy transition. Smart energy district approach allows to better solutions from the thermodynamic and economic point of view, and to integrate renewable energy sources, which by their nature are ‘fluctuating,’ with the energy demands using a data centre to menage the energy flows. To evaluate the benefits that a district could obtain when integrating energy planning in regeneration plans, the authors analyse the effects of a different approach to the urban design that goes beyond the traditional tasks of designing districts’ spatial aspects and propose a consistent technical analysis during the decision-making process. To do this, after defining strategic targets related to energy and resource issues, the authors implement different scenarios, evaluating the most suitable technologies that can be integrated in the area. The process of modelling and simulating the energy system hour by hour enables to identify the synergies among the energy sectors. This is done by creating models using different energy tools, as the ones used in this work. The research work analyses a real case for a possible process of urban regeneration, of former industrial area in a district located in the city of Naples, through retrofit and re-use of existing buildings, the construction of new ones and the implementation of smart infrastructures. The overall goal of this work is to present and evaluate different development configuration of a smart energy district when going from the planning to the design phase. The analysed system is designed for matching the power and thermal flow rate demands of the district considered, including the power demand of electric vehicles charging stations, as well as the energy for space heating and cooling. A technoeconomic analysis of three technical alternatives has been implemented, each one characterized by a different energy mix, allowing to verify the most suitable option between the individual and central heating and cooling supply.

Limited driving range, prolonged charging times, and inadequate charging infrastructure are the key barriers to EV adoption. To address the problem of prolonged charging time, the simple approach of developing a new charging station to enhance the charging capacity may not work due to the limitation of physical space and strain on power grids. Prediction of precise EV charging time can assist the drivers in effective planning of their trips to alleviate range anxiety during trips. Therefore, this study employed four different ensemble machine learning (EML) algorithms: random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), categorical boosting, and light gradient boosting machine, for predicting EVs' charging time. The prediction experiments were based on 2 years of real-world charging event data from 500 EVs in Japan's private and commercial vehicles. The study emphasized predicting charging time for different charging modes, that is, normal and fast charging operations. The results indicate that EML models performed well under various scenarios, with the XGBoost model having the highest accuracy. Moreover, we also employ the newly developed Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) approach to tackle the non-interpretability issues of the ML algorithm by interpreting the XGBoost model outputs.

Therefore, one of the original challenges in the development of EVs is the optimal allocation of FCSs considering the goals and limitations of both transportation and distribution networks. This paper proposes a model for locating FCSs and renewable energy resources (RESs) taking into account the EVs behavior as well as a wide range of affecting factors, including the uncertainty associated with the RESs, EVs arrival rate, and state of charge (SoC), different driving ranges, and all-shortest and deviation paths. The proposed model minimizes the costs of installing FCSs and RESs and substation expansion and maximizes the traffic flow captured by the FCSs. For this purpose, first, the modeling of the uncertainties of RESs and the capacitated diversion flow-refueling location model based on expanded networks (CDFRLM-EN) is introduced to cover the charging demand of EVs on the transportation network. Then the problem of locating FCSs and RESs is formulated based on the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The proposed framework is implemented on a 14-bus distribution test system coupled with a 25-node transportation network. The results show that the presence of RESs, diversion paths, and the uncertainty associated with the arrival state of charge and the driving range differences influence the location and size of FCSs, the investment cost, and the EVs’ satisfaction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Capacitated diversion flow-refueling location model; Driving range; Electric vehicle; Locating; Renewable energy sources; Uncertainty","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Uncertainty analysis; Capacitated diversion flow-refueling location model; Charging station; Driving range; Fast charging stations; Location modeling; Renewable energy source; Siting and sizings; States of charges; Transportation network; Uncertainty; Location","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131267112"

From the grid point of view an aggregate of electric vehicles can act as a flexible load, thus able to provide balancing services. The problem of computing the optimal day-ahead charging schedule for all vehicles in the fleet is a challenging one, especially because it is affected by many sources of uncertainty. In this paper we consider the uncertainty deriving from arrival and departure times, arrival energy and services market outcomes. We propose a general optimization framework to deal with the day ahead planning that encompasses different kind of use-cases. We adopt a robust paradigm to enforce the constraints and an expectation paradigm for the cost function. For all constraints and cost terms we propose an exact formulation or a very tight approximation, even in the case of piece-wise linear battery dynamics.

Rule-based home energy management systems (HEMSs) are developed for two different configurations of the GCH: 1) with only SWT and 2) with SWT and BES. For each configuration, the HEMSs are developed for two cases: with and without an EV in the premises of the GCH. Uncertainties are also included in the arrival time, departure time, and initial state of charge (at arrival) of the EV. The abovementioned technique is then applied to a typical household in South Australia using the yearly load profile of the household and actual yearly wind speed data at an interval of one hour. To investigate the effects of stochastic nature of household load, EV, and wind power generation on various results, the optimization process is repeated using 10-year of actual wind speed data and probabilistic load and EV uncertainties. The results of several sensitivity analyses of various system parameters are presented. It has been found that the SWT can effectively decrease the COE of the household for both cases (with and without an EV). However, the current price of battery may not be in favor of further reducing the COE of the household. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Battery energy storage; Capacity optimization; Cost of electricity; Electric vehicle; Energy management system; Small wind turbine","Battery management systems; Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Costs; Digital storage; Electric load management; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management systems; Hydrogen storage; Optimization; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Battery energy storage; Capacity optimization; Cost of electricity; Grid-connected; Home energy management systems; Load modeling; Optimisations; Small wind turbine; Uncertainty; Wind speed; Wind turbines","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122569848"

This operation-planning framework provides a suitable and interactive environment for the electricity market, distribution company (DISCO), electric vehicle (EV) aggregator, and rival DISCOs to increase the HC. The problem is modeled via a bilevel conditional-value-at-risk-constrained stochastic programming approach. The DISCO, in the upper level (UL), tries to maximize the HC and minimize the operating costs while interacting with a passive electricity market and an EV aggregator. The aggregator, in the lower level, aims to maximize their profit by interacting with the primary DISCO in the UL and the rival DISCO, to satisfy the EV owners. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are used to recast the model into an equivalent single level. The proposed framework is tested on a 33-node distribution network.

Nowadays, the evolution of distribution networks and investment decisions (conductors and transformers) can no longer be based solely on deterministic assumptions of load evolution since there is a high level of uncertainties related to the development of electrical loads such as electric vehicles. In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty of the peak power, key elements for triggering an investment, and the flexibility to choose between different topologies of electric networks. To solve this problem, we apply a real option approach and provide an analytical model with closed-form solutions that allows a full treatment of the dynamic aspects of the decision to reconsider the topology of the network. Moreover, through a comparative statics analysis, we infer the sensitivity of the option value to modify the network with respect to the volatility of the peak power, the associated investment cost or other types of costs of power losses, the growth rate, or the discount rate. © 2022 by the authors.","distribution network; irreversible investment; real options; uncertainty","Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Electric power transmission networks; Investments; Smart power grids; Topology; Distribution grid; Electrical distribution; Investment timing; Irreversible investments; Load uncertainty; Long term planning; Peak power; Real Options; Smart grid; Uncertainty; Timing circuits","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137684880"

However, associated optimal deployment is highly challenging due to the involved high-dimensional system planning, non-linear component sizing, and complex solar potential accurate characterization. To address this challenge, this study proposed a strategy to minimize the payback period of the deployed rooftop PV and batteries for achieving net-zero energy of electric bus transportation by taking associated grid impacts into consideration. In this strategy, a genetic algorithm-integer linear programming (GA-ILP) approach was developed to solve the high-dimensional rooftop PV planning problem and the non-linear PV and battery sizing problem. Our 3D-GIS (geographic information system) and DL (deep learning) integrated approach was used to attain accurate spatiotemporal rooftop solar power generation profiles. To verify the proposed strategy, a case study covering 5 bus terminuses with 28 bus routes and a total of 1,224 building rooftops surrounding the terminuses was conducted in a real region of Hong Kong. The effectiveness of the developed strategy was verified by comparing the optimized deployment with 150 million Monte-Carlo-generated solutions. The optimized deployment achieved the shortest payback period of 3.98 years by effectively tackling design issues such as battery oversizing, PV misallocation, and battery misallocation. To meet the increasing requirement on peak export power reduction (representing the grid impact constraint in the study), the proposed strategy can find a cost-effective balance between shifting PVs from higher-density solar potential terminuses to lower ones and increasing battery capacity. The proposed strategy can be adopted in practice to facilitate the development of cost-effective and grid-friendly community-solar-powered electric bus networks in high-density cities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed rooftop PV; Electric bus; High-density city; Net-zero energy; Optimal design","Buses; Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Investments; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Distributed rooftop photovoltaic; Electric bus; High-density cities; Hong-kong; Net-zero energy; Non linear; Optimal deployment; Optimal design; Photovoltaics; Zero energies; Cost effectiveness; atmospheric pollution; electric vehicle; integrated approach; linear programing; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; solar power; China; Hong Kong","The research work presented in this paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Project No 52178091.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130809324"

Since fuel cell electric vehicles have been attracting considerable attention, the production and supply of renewable hydrogen through hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs) are of great importance. The growing energy demand, inappropriate siting and sizing of HRSs, and high penetration of distributed renewable energy sources (RESs) make power distribution network planning very challenging. This paper proposes an integrated multi-stage and multi-zone expansion planning framework to coordinate the investment and scheduling of HRSs, wind and solar energy sources, and the distribution network. To model the green HRSs, water electrolysers powered by renewable electricity and storage tanks to locally produce and store hydrogen are suggested. The objective of the proposed problem is to minimise the investment, operation, emissions, and maintenance costs of network's assets, RESs, and HRSs. The RESs expansion scheme comprises the installation of two different groups; the former pertains to distributed renewable sources installed over the network while the latter is integrated into HRSs. Case studies are conducted on 6-node and real Australian 100-node distribution networks.

The suggested algorithm reduces consumers cost by selecting optimal BESS sizes regarding the uncertainty of the market price, power generation of the PV, the amount of charge of the EV and the electricity of the grid. It is so crucial that all uncertainties and consumers' life style are considered to achieve accurate results by taken in to account as double apply both in BESS optimal sizing and EMS of smart home community.

Future issues will be exacerbated by the relationship between the distribution system of DGs solely, DGs with Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), and DGs with Extended Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (Ex-PHEV). This paper discusses the use of a multi-tasking Genetic Algorithm to optimize DGs with EVs planning in distribution systems for load models for rating and placement determination. From a system perspective, the goal of this research is to reduce total real power loss. The various types of DGs with EVs are taken into account from the standpoint of the analysis. Photovoltaic, diesel engines, synchronous condensers, and doubly-fed induction generators are examples of various types of DGs. In this analysis, EV types such as FCEV and Ex-PHEV are considered. Different forms of constant impedance (Z), constant current (I), and constant power (P) load models are included in DGs with EVs planning for improving system performance indices, such as Light-emitting diode, Laptop charger, Personal computer, Tungsten light, and Vacuum tube. The real power loss index (% ILP), the reactive power loss index (% ILQ), the voltage deviation index (% IVD), the short circuit current reduction (% IC), the active power DGs with EVs penetration (% P<inf>PWDGs & EVs</inf>), and the reactive power DGs with EVs penetration (% P<inf>QWDGs & EVs</inf>) are all measured in this paper. On the 37-bus test distribution system, the effectiveness of the listed approach was verified.

Furthermore, difference in regional energy pricing policy can be fully utilised to economically incentivise participation willingness of stakeholders. However, the current literature provides few studies and little knowledge on the topic. In this study, a spatiotemporal energy network in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area was proposed for regional energy balance with different types of buildings in demand-shortage and renewable-abundant regions, and electric vehicles for daily commuting. Roles of electricity-powered vehicles include renewable charging for clean transportation through Building-to-Vehicle (B2V) interaction, spatiotemporal energy sharing through Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) interaction, voltage/power stabilization of local grids through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) interaction. Techno-economic-environmental potentials of the proposed spatiotemporal energy network are evaluated for carbon neutrality transition. Advanced energy pricing policy and energy interaction modes are identified, based on dynamic energy trading and associated cost, among building owners, vehicle owners, and utility companies of power grids. Economic analysis and decision-making on multi-stakeholders are analysed, including external cost with power grids, internal cost, and battery degradation cost. Results showed that the proposed spatiotemporal energy network with the V2G interaction mode can improve the renewable penetration ratio from 0.7 to 0.722, the demand coverage ratio from 0.021 to 0.039, with the decrease in equivalent CO<inf>2</inf> emission from 5.04x106 to 4.78x106 kg by 5.2%, and annual import cost from 8.16x106 to 8.0x106 HK$ by 2.0%. However, compared to the isolated system, the spatiotemporal energy network will lead to the increase of battery degradation cost from 0.594x105 to 0.688x105 HK$, by 15.8%, due to the increase in battery charging/discharging cycles. In order to economically incentivise participation willingness of all stakeholders, advanced energy pricing policy and energy interaction modes are identified as Policy 5 and V2G interaction mode, under which vehicles can increase the internal trading cost from 0 to 1.78x105 HK$, overwhelming its battery depreciation cost at 0.688 x105 HK$.

For this purpose, this paper develops three scenarios representing different levels of EV penetration and assesses the scenario impacts with a view to identify policy implications and policy trade-offs of an increased EV deployment. A Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) model is employed, in this study, to assess the scenario impacts for the period 2020–2037. The analyses showed that high EV deployment in the transport sector would provide noticeable benefits, for example, reducing energy demand in the transport sector, decreasing primary energy requirements, and mitigating emissions of CO<inf>2</inf>, NOx and PM2.5. An increase in electricity generation would be, however, required for supporting increased EVs. The analyses further revealed that the impacts of high EV adoption in the transport sector could be considered in terms of both emerging challenges and opportunities. In terms of emerging challenges, promotion of EV adoption would pose several challenges including electricity grid impacts, energy security issues, and impacts on related industries. In order to address these challenges, the development of long-term electricity planning taking into account various issues, for example, a mixture of generating capacity additions, infrastructure expansion, coordinated charging, and time-of-use tariff setting would be essentially needed. EVs deployment would also bring several opportunities including the implementation of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology in smart grid and integration of renewable energy with V2X in smart grid. The success of these opportunities would, however, require policy supports from the Thai government and also the development of a consistent policy framework considering all related sectors. This framework is urgently required in order to provide effective strategies for developing sustainable future of electric mobility in Thailand. © 2022 The Authors","Electric vehicle; Electricity sector; Renewable energy; Thailand; Transport sector","Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy security; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Vehicle-to-grid; Electricity sector; Low emission; Policy implications; Renewable energies; Road transport sectors; Smart grid; Thailand; Trade off; Transport sectors; Vehicle penetration; Economic and social effects","This research project was financially supported by Mahasarakham University 2021.

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first V2G acceptance study that is based on actual users’ experience of V2G charging. A test set up with a V2G charge point at a solar carport was constructed at the Delft University of Technology. Seventeen participants in the study were given access to a V2G-compatible Nissan LEAF and the constructed V2G charging facilities, after which they were interviewed. Clear communication of the impacts of V2G charging cycles on EV batteries, financial compensation covering these impacts, real-time insight on the battery state-of-charge and the ability to set operational parameters through a user-friendly interface were all found to foster acceptance. The main barriers for acceptance were the uncertainty associated with battery state-of-charge, the increased need for planning charging and trips, the increased anxiety about the ability of the vehicle to reach its destination, economic and performance-related effects on the EV’s battery and the restriction of the freedom that users associated with their personal vehicles. The participants were found to be divided across high, conditional and low acceptance of V2G charging. The use of V2G charging over the trial period was found to inform their opinions: tangible factors such as range anxiety and the user interface were given more importance than abstract concepts such as lack of standards that were discussed by users without experience of V2G charging. Our study indicates that V2G charging in its current form is acceptable to a section of current EV users. The discussion provides insights on extending the relevance of our findings across other user groups and over further developments in the field. © 2022 by the authors.

It not only gradually realizes the coordinated control of source–grid– load–storage, but also strives to realize the multi-level coordination of the transmission network, distribution network and microgrid. Disorderly charging and discharging of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) will have a great negative impact on the distribution network, but aggregating EVs and guiding them to charge and discharge in an orderly manner will play a positive role in delaying investment in the distribution network. Therefore, it is urgent to adopt an effective scheduling control strategy for electric vehicle charging and discharging. First, a variety of indexes were set to analyze the influence of EVs access on distribution network and the correlation between the indexes. Then, by defining the EVs penetration rate and the load simultaneous rate, the charging load planning of EVs was calculated. Based on the simultaneous load rate, the regional electricity load plan was calculated, and a configuration model of distribution capacity suitable for charging loads in different regions was constructed. Finally, an optimal dispatch model for electric vehicles considering the safety of distribution network was proposed and the distribution transformer capacity allocation model was used as the optimization target constraint. Compared with most optimized dispatch models used to maximize aggregator revenues and reduce peak-to-valley differences and load fluctuations in distribution networks, this model could effectively reduce unnecessary investment while meeting regional distribution transformer needs and maintaining distribution network security. Taking the improved IEEE 34-bus systems as an example, the simulation analysis was carried out and the investment demand of distribution network under the condition of disordered and orderly charge and discharge was compared. The results show that the proposed optimal scheduling method can effectively reduce the load fluctuation of distribution network, keep the voltage offset within the allowable voltage deviation range, and can effectively delay the investment of distribution network. © 2022 by the authors.

To develop a PHEV with HESS, it is a key link to obtain the optimal size of the power supply and energy system that can meet the load requirements of a driving cycle. Since little effort has been dedicated to simultaneously performing the component sizing of PHEV and HESS, this paper proposes an approach based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to simultaneously determine the sizes of the engine, motor, battery and supercapacitor (SC) in a PHEV with HESS. The drivetrain cost is minimized in a different all-electric range (AER)—and depends on the battery type—while ensuring the driving performance requirements. In addition, the effects of the power system and drive cycle on the component sizes were analyzed and compared. The simulation results show that the cost of the PHEV drivetrain with the Ni-MH battery/SC HESS is reduced by up to 12.21% when compared to the drivetrain with the Li-ion battery/SC HESS. The drivetrain cost is reduced by 8.79% when compared to analysis-based optimization. The type of power supply system and drive cycle can significantly affect the optimization results. © 2022 by the authors.

This study determines in which municipalities and at what additional cost energy autonomy is feasible for a case study of Germany. An existing municipal energy system optimization model is extended to include the industrial, commercial and personal transport sectors. Multiple regression methods are benchmarked in order to identify the model best suited for the transfer of individual optimization results to a large proportion of German municipalities. The resulting levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from the optimization of representative case study municipalities are transferred using energy-relevant indicators. The study demonstrates that energy autonomy is technically feasible in 6,314 (56%) municipalities. Thereby, the LCOEs increase in the autonomous case on average by 0.41 €/kWh compared to the minimum cost scenario. Apart from energy demand, base-load-capable bioenergy and deep geothermal energy have the greatest influence on the LCOEs. Overall, it appears that municipal energy autonomy is not economically viable under current framework conditions. This study represents a starting point for defining possible scenarios in studies of future national energy system or transmission grid expansion planning, which for the first time consider completely energy autonomous municipalities. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Electric vehicles; Energy autonomy; Geothermal power generation; Mixed integer linear programming; Regression analysis; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-grid","Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Geothermal energy; Integer programming; Vehicle-to-grid; Case-studies; Energy; Energy autonomies; Geothermal power generation; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimisations; Renewable energies; Vehicle to grids; Regression analysis","The work of Sabrina Ried was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BDL project, funding reference: 01MV18004H)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133184820"

Consequently, efforts are taking place to electrify industry, heating, and transportation. The Finnish government has set the target to halve carbon dioxide traffic emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. Due to this target, the currently small proportion of electric vehicles (EVs) in Finland could expand in a manner that is difficult to forecast but could be exponential. Amid already strained investment budgets, anticipating the alternative scenarios and impacts of such a transport electrification evolution is of high importance to distribution system operators in order to optimize network planning and enhancements during the coming 15–25 years. The novelty and contribution of this paper is in utilizing a formal scenario planning process to envision what the alternative scenarios are (i.e., possible futures) for the evolution of the electric car fleet in Finland until 2040 and how these alternative scenarios could impact distribution grids. The impact analysis is performed in terms of additional energy and additional power in order to gain an understanding of the high-level impacts and investment needs. The analysis utilizes a real distribution grid in southern Finland as a case example that enables quantification. The results indicate the electric vehicles will, depending the scenario, pose an essential additional load in terms of both energy and power and that the required investment levels and investment types will be heavily dependent on the scenario. © 2022 by the authors.

Smart grids can be a cost-effective solution to overcome increases in energy demand and ensure power security. Current applications of smart grids involve a large numbers of agents (e.g., electric vehicles). Since each agent must interact with other agents when taking decisions (e.g., movement and scheduling), the computational complexity of smart grid systems increases exponentially with the number of agents. Computational tractability of planning is a significant barrier to implementation of large-scale smart grids of electric vehicles. Existing solution approaches such as mixed-integer programming and dynamic programming are not computationally efficient for high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a reformulation of a Mixed-Integer Programming model into a Decentralized Markov Decision Process model and solves it using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to address the scalability issues of large-scale smart grid systems. The Decentralized Markov Decision Process model uses centralized training and distributed execution: agents are trained using a unique actor network for each agent and a shared critic network, and then agent execute actions independently from other agents to reduce computation time. The performance of the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning model is assessed under different configurations of customers and electric vehicles, and compared to the results from deep reinforcement learning and three heuristic algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm can reduce simulation time significantly compared to deep reinforcement learning, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and the artificial fish swarm algorithm.

Proper planning and operation of EV supply equipment (EVSE) is essential to ensure the efficient and economic operations of the EV fleets. Charging stations (CS) have gained market attention due to their lower cost and versatility. Battery swapping stations (BSS) have also received considerable attention because of their promise to provide fast and sustainable battery replacements. However, their commercial viability is unclear due to their requirement for large capital and infrastructure deployment. In this paper, we develop a stochastic model for interactions between CS/BSS and taxi/bus fleets. The model is based on a realistic abstraction of users' behavior defined by various stochastic processes. It also considers the dynamic impacts of the road congestion.

However, the lack of pervasive en-route charging infrastructure on regional highway networks hinders the use of electric vehicles for long-distance intercity trips. Traditionally, transportation and power systems are often studied separately, each by itself as a complex system. This paper proposes a system of systems modeling framework for planning charging infrastructure deployment in intercity transportation networks while considering users' travel behavior and coupling relationships between transportation and power systems. The aim is at facilitating long-distance electric vehicle travels and providing an effective and comprehensive tool to evaluate the total emissions from both the transportation and power sectors. We look at a somewhat 'forward-looking' problem in which the charging loads of widely-adopted electric vehicles induce interdependence between the power and the transportation sectors. A general equilibrium modeling framework is developed to capture the interdependencies among charging infrastructure design, users' travel behaviors, and power sector operations. An iterative solution approach is proposed to solve the overall equilibrium between the transportation and power sectors, and a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the bi-level subproblem for the charging infrastructure deployment. Numerical experiments based on a semi-realistic case study are performed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed modeling and solution approach. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","charging infrastructure; Electric vehicle; electricity pricing; emission mitigation","Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heuristic algorithms; Iterative methods; System of systems; Charging infrastructures; Coupling relationships; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; General equilibrium models; Intercity transportations; Iterative solutions; Numerical experiments; Transportation sector; Charging (batteries)","This work was supported in part by the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE) at the University of Illinois and in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CMMI-1662825.

In turn, the resultant growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) calls for the development of a well-designed charging infrastructure. However, an inappropriate placement of charging stations might hamper smooth operation of the power grid and be inconvenient to EV drivers. Thus, the present work proposes a novel two-stage planning model for charging station placement. The candidate locations for the placement of charging stations are first determined by fuzzy inference considering distance, road traffic, and grid stability. The randomness in road traffic is modelled by applying a Bayesian network (BN). Then, the charging station placement problem is represented in a multi-objective framework with cost, voltage stability reliability power loss (VRP) index, accessibility index, and waiting time as objective functions. A hybrid algorithm combining chicken swarm optimization and the teaching-learning-based optimization (CSO TLBO) algorithm is used to obtain the Pareto front. Further, fuzzy decision making is used to compare the Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed planning model is validated on a superimposed IEEE 33-bus and 25-node test network and on a practical network in Tianjin, China. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed model. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Bayesian network; charging station; congestion; CSO TLBO; electric vehicle; optimization","Bayesian networks; Decision making; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy inference; Pareto principle; Roads and streets; Charging infrastructures; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental pollutions; Fuzzy Decision making; Pareto optimal solutions; Stability reliability; Teaching-learning-based optimizations; Transportation electrifications; Charging (batteries)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101750693"

In this paper, the primary goal is to devise a closed-form expression for the PEV charging station capacity problem. Two types of commercial charging stations are considered. The first problem is related to the calculation of the optimal service capacity for charging lots located at workplaces where PEV parking statistics are given as a priori. The second problem, on the other hand, is related to the optimisation of arrival rates for a given station capacity. In the second part, the mathematical models are expanded for the case where multiple charger technologies serve customer demand. This time the goal is to calculate the optimal customer load for each charger type according to its rate. Calculations are carried out for both social and individual optimality cases. Markovian queues are used to model the charging station system to capture the complex interactions between customer load, service waiting times, and electricity cost. The related optimisation problems are solved using convex optimisation methods. Closed-form expressions of station capacity and optimal arrival rates are explicitly derived. Both analytical calculations and discrete-event simulations are carried out and the results show that 60% of the waiting times and 42% of the queue length can be reduced by optimal capacity planning. © 2021 The Authors.

The proposed hybrid optimization technique is the consolidation of recalling-enhanced recurrent neural network (RERNN) and Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), hence it is called RERNN-m2MPA technique. Here, an enhanced MPA (m2MPA) is proposed. The major objective of this article is to energy loss reduction, voltage deviation of the power system network and minimization of the land cost with maximum weightage to serve maximum EV with minimum installation cost. The lessening of voltage deviation is considered as objective function to maintain a stable voltage profile in every nodes. The land cost is diminished with weightage maximization to serve maximal electric vehicle with minimal installation cost of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS). In this proposal, optimal location with capacity of fast charging stations and RESs are determined concurrently, while determined the deviation paths and uncertainties of RESs. To this intention, RERNN is proposed to cover the charging demand for EVs on the transportation network. Moreover, an m2MPA is proposed to optimal allocation of RESs and fast charging stations with respect to the distribution and transportation networks. Likewise, the proposed technique minimizes the adverse effects of fast charging demand on the grid, particularly during peak periods reducing the need for larger capabilities of energy storage units to absorb fast charging fluctuations and reduces the need for separate FCS installation. By then, the proposed technique is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink platform, its performance is compared with various existing techniques. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","cost; electric vehicle charging station; energy loss; fast charging stations; optimal location and sizing; renewable energy sources","Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric losses; Location; Natural resources; Recurrent neural networks; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Fast charging stations; Hybrid optimization; Location and sizings; Optimal locations; Optimal sizing; Optimization techniques; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy resources","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125522105"

To facilitate the analysis, square grids are built to form cells representing the number of electric vehicles in any specific area of interest. This estimated number of electric vehicles is further analyzed to determine the energy consumption, calculate the recommended number of public chargers, and visualize an increase in the substation loads from those charging stations. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using the whole area of Thailand, consisting of five regions with a total area of 513,120 km2.

Conventional power plants are replaced by renewable generation (e.g. wind turbines, photovoltaics) that contribute to the reduction of power system inertia. This may introduce frequency stability issues because frequency is affected by the amount of system inertia, along with the response of controllable frequency reserves and the amount of power imbalance. Therefore, the estimation and analysis of power system inertia and the frequency response assessment is essential to ensure power system stability and security. This paper proposes a novel method to estimates the inertia constant for three different periods in future, namely, 2025, 2035 and 2050 based on the produced future energy scenarios (FES) for Rwandan's power system. In addition, the paper evaluates the frequency response dynamics for each scenario. Results show that the highest progression in renewable energy resources penetration resulted to a larger reduction in the system inertia constant (from 7.2 in control area 1 to 3.83s in control area 3) and the largest frequency drop was observed during the high progression scenario in the year 2050 where the PV and imported power penetration was expected to reach more than 30% of the total installed capacity. © 2022","Abbreviations; ACE, area control error; ADB, adaptive deadbeat; BESS, battery energy storage system; EVs, electric vehicles; FES, future energy scenario; Frequency Control; Future energy scenario; GB, Great Britain; Inertia constant estimation; ISOs, independent system operators; LFC, load frequency control; MFLN, modified functional link net; PES, power and energy society; Power system; PSO, particle swarm optimization; RoCoF, rate of change of frequency; Rwanda; SOF, system operability framework; SQP, sequential quadratic program","Adaptive control systems; Battery storage; Electric frequency control; Electric power system control; Frequency estimation; Frequency response; Quadratic programming; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Abbreviation; ACE, area control error; ADB, adaptive deadbeat; Area control error; Battery energy storage systems; BESS, battery energy storage system; Energy scenarios; EV, electric vehicle; Frequency control; Functional-link net; Future energies; Future energy scenario; Future energy scenario, future energy scenario; GB, great britain; Great Britain; Independent system operators; Inertia constant estimation; Inertia constants; ISO, independent system operator; LFC, load frequency control; MFLN, modified functional link net; PES, power and energy society; Power; Power system; Quadratic programs; Rate of change of frequencies; RoCoF, rate of change of frequency; Rwanda; SOF, system operability framework; SQP, sequential quadratic program; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","The authors would like to thank Rwanda Energy Group for providing the needed data for the network.

For this reason, recently few studies have started to investigate the vulnerability of a highly coupled traffic-power system in the presence of disruptive events. Actually, however, only very few of these studies have considered the impact of EVs on the interdependent traffic-power system during restoration from a disruptive event. In an attempt to fill this gap, in this study, we investigate the restoration planning of both independent RNs and PNs, and interdependent traffic-power systems. A mixed integer program model is formulated to provide optimal reconfiguration and operational solutions for post-disruption traffic-power systems recovery. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost incurred by system performance loss, which is quantified by the cumulative unmet traffic demand for RNs and load shedding cost for PNs. Several reconfiguration strategies are considered, including links reversing in RNs and line switching in PNs, to optimize system resilience. In the proposed model, the integrated problem of system optimal dynamic traffic assignment and optimal power flow is solved to derive the optimal traffic-power flow. RNs and PNs are coupled through the coordinately allocated spatio-temporal charging demand of EVs. A partial highway network in North Carolina (NC), USA, and a modified IEEE-14 bus system are used to illustrate the application of the model. The numerical results obtained show the added value of coordinately planning restoration for traffic-power systems and the effects of different levels of EV penetration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Fast-charging stations; Interdependent systems; Optimal traffic-power flow; Resilience; Traffic-power systems","Acoustic generators; Charging (batteries); Electric load shedding; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Restoration; Uncertainty analysis; Disruptive event; Fast charging stations; Interdependent systems; Optimal traffic-power flow; Power; Power flows; Power networks; Resilience; Road network; Traffic-power system; Electric load flow","Funding text 1: The participation of Hongping Wang to this research is supported by China Scholarship Council (No. 201606990003 ).

However, PEVs growth is moderate owing to range anxiety of drivers. In this context, fast charging stations (FCSs) deployment is an emerging development to lower the range anxiety of drivers. Though, heavy deployment of PEVs has up-surged the need of load demand on power systems. This requires a coordinated operation between power systems and future transportation systems to meet their demands. The FCS investors have keen interest in the net present value (NPV) of the project. On the other hand, the utility wants to keep its peak demand within the limits to ensure the safe-operation. This creates a contradiction between the FCS investor and utility’ objectives. Thus, this paper proposes an analytical approach for traffic-based multi-stage planning of FCS that aids FCS investor by considering PEV traffic, staggered investments, convenience of PEV drivers, profit on investments, and capacity limit of FCS imposed by the utility. The formulation for NPV is modified to account the revenue incurred owing to staggered investments. Proposed methodology determines a set of few sub-solutions constrained by mean service time of PEVs. This facilitates FCS investor to select the planning solution on the basis of his/her satisfaction. Detailed investigation of the proposed methodology highlights the applications and importance on assessing the FCS investors’ concerns while considering the affecting factors of transportation system, power system, drivers’ concerns, and profit margins altogether. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fast charging stations; Multi-stage planning; Net present value; Plug-in electric vehicles; Service time","Charging (batteries); Investments; Planning; Profitability; Environmental concerns; Fast charging stations; Load demand; Multi-stage planning; Power; Range anxieties; Service time; System infrastructure; The net present value (NPV); Transportation system; Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125269336"

Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to the security of the smart grid. It is possible for any Electric Vehicle (EV), charging station (CS), or other components to be compromised, and they can infect other stations too. This problem can damage even the central infrastructure. We can prevent the spread of attacks by isolating the high-risk stations. Researches in this area have not considered the availability of charging infrastructure, and they only tried to reduce the speed of threat propagation. EV battery capacity is limited, and they need charging at several stations during a trip. So availability of specified stations along the route to recharge the vehicles is critical. We first present a model that minimizes security risk and maximizes the availability of the stations. Second, we propose another model for EVs itinerary planning that detects the best plans according to their status, system topology, and threat level of stations. Our model is used to minimize the outage probability of stations and infection propagation speed in peak time. This model also reduces the tour time of the EVs.

The lack of flexibility and the time connection of scheduling for public transit make EBS harder than internal combustion ones.

Therefore, the critically planned charging stations infrastructure is essential to resolve these problems. In fact, the distribution network operators (DSO), EV users, and intelligent commercial parking lots (CPL) owners are holding different views that should be considered simultaneously to improve the accuracy of an effective business plan. However, the prime challenge in addressing the planning of CPL is to increase the EV user interest while enhancing the CPL owners’ profit. Simultaneously, DSO requirement for network performance under the appropriate conditions (for example, imbalance) will also be considered. Further one of the main challenges of CPL presence in an imbalanced distribution network is the effect that additionally carry on network imbalance indices. In this paper, a two-stage framework has proposed where the first stage is accompanied with several technical parameters such as battery terms, charge/discharge specifications, and transportation parameters including daily distance traveled, arrival and departure times to the CPL, and amount EV sales, the profitability of the EV charging/discharging program for EV users as well as CPL owners calculated in the optimal CPL scheduling. In the second stage, the effect of CPLs is studied by calculating the imbalance indices in a standard IEEE imbalanced distribution network. Moreover, the results confirm that the average profit for EV users has been increased by 23% compared to the total cost paid for charging EV. Eventually, it is recognized that without changing the distribution network structure and connecting CPL to active commercial loads of the distribution network, the network imbalance could be improved around 30% during EV charging. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle parking; Imbalance indices; Imbalanced distribution network; Intelligent charging planning","Charging (batteries); Commercial vehicles; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Distribution network operators; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle parking; Imbalance index; Imbalanced distribution network; Intelligent charging planning; Parking lots; Power grids; Vehicle parking; Vehicle users; Profitability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124211638"

This study develops an innovative multi-level optimization framework for the energy management coordination between microgrids and CMGs in the lower level, between clusters and distribution systems, and finally between distribution systems and upstream networks in the upper level. Accordingly, an hourly optimal energy management (HOEM) system is applied to minimize the multi-objective objective function for each level. The lower level may be operated in islanded or grid-connected mode in some hours. This is decided by changing switches between MGs, clusters, and grids, while the upper level is only operated in the grid-connected mode. Moreover, a demand response program that has a great effect on the hourly planning of switches is modeled in the upper level. The proposed model is tested on CMGs and actual distribution systems.

Based on the Floyd algorithm, we ensure the timeliness of path planning by updating the link weights in real time. The EV intelligent path planning strategy comprehensively considers the travel time, charging energy, charging cost, and user convenience. In addition, to ensure that the grid bus voltage has the lowest deviation rate while considering the bus load limit, we propose a multi-stage two-layer optimization algorithm to determine the charging power of each link. The upper layer uses the particle swarm optimization, and the decision variable is the charging power of each link; the lower layer calculates the voltage deviation rate by solving the alternating current optimal power flow model.

We develop a method to simulate nuclear schedule optimization to reflect how plant managers maximize plant availability during peak-demand periods. Using this schedule optimization, we compute each plant's minimum power level and its variation over time to evaluate the flexibility potential. Three nuclear flexibility hypotheses are considered: one where fleet schedule is considered constant, which is standard practice in the energy systems modeling literature, one with an optimized fleet schedule with constant minimum power, and one with an optimized fleet schedule with physics-induced minimum power variations. Sensitivity analysis highlights the links between the fleet's schedule optimization, minimal power variations, relative share of nuclear and renewables in the capacity mix, and results of simulation models. We find that the nuclear fleet's optimization and associated realistic minimum power variations gain in importance with increasing relative share of nuclear in the capacity mix. The schedule's importance holds as renewables' installed capacities heighten as the residual demand level decreases. This paper highlights the potential benefits of modeling nuclear schedule optimizations and the resulting minimum power evolutions. Both aspects are crucial for evaluating nuclear flexibility characteristics in simplified low-carbon electric systems that use a significant share of renewable energy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Economic dispatch; Flexible power operation; Mixed-integer linear programming; Nuclear energy; Nuclear schedule; Renewable energy integration; Unit commitment","Electric load dispatching; Integer programming; Plant management; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Economic Dispatch; Flexible power operation; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear; Mixed-integer linear programming; Nuclear schedule; Power operation; Renewable energy integrations; Schedule optimizations; Unit Commitment; Scheduling; alternative energy; electric vehicle; four-dimensional modeling; modeling; operations technology; optimization; simulated annealing; simulation","Funding text 1: This work received financial support from by Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, a French government-funded public research organization.

However, the uncertainty of RGs has also exerted significant challenges to the grid operation and control. Therefore, dynamic power system scheduling to accommodate the intermittent RGs and mass roll-out of PEVs has become extremely important. In this paper, a novel power system rescheduling strategy is proposed to tackle this problem. Considering the uncertainty of the wind energy, a set of indices according to different wind power application scenarios is proposed to initiate a rescheduling scheme for power generations. In addition, a social learning particle swarm optimization algorithm based on real-value and binary parallel is proposed to schedule the output of generator units and the charging and discharging of the PEV. The effectiveness of the proposed active rescheduling framework and solving algorithm has been verified by extensive experiments considering different number of generating units and scenarios, achieving up to over 5.3% cost reduction. The experimental results have also shown that through expropriate management of the charging and discharging of PEVs would be significantly alleviate the negative impact on the grid stability caused by the intermittent wind power generations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Renewable energy; Rescheduling scheme; Unit commitment","Climate change; Cost reduction; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Plug-in electric vehicles; Wind power; Large-scales; Pollutants emissions; Power; Power generation plants; Renewable energies; Renewable power generation; Rescheduling scheme; Thermal power generation; Uncertainty; Unit Commitment; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; fossil fuel; power generation; wind power","National Science Foundation of China under grants 52077213 and 62003332 , and Outstanding Young Researcher Innovation Fund of Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2018–22).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126294242"

Despite the efforts of the European Union towards the minimization of power losses, the decarbonization of the transport sector has raised several concerns, since charging overlaps of Electric Vehicles (EVs) can cause extensive power losses and power quality issues. Considering these, the present paper proposes a two-stage EV charging planning and Network Reconfiguration (NR) methodology, addressing the problem of power loss minimization in both Low-Voltage (LV) and Medium-Voltage (MV) Distribution Networks (DNs), respectively. In the first stage, considering the key role of the aggregator, the EV charging planning is applied to LV DN. In the second stage, the NR technique is applied to the MV DN, by taking into account the hourly power demand of LV DNs as obtained by the aggregators. The proposed methodology has been applied on a benchmarked MV network for which each node is represented by a real LV network. The results indicate that the proposed methodology could yield up to a 63.64% power loss reduction, in respect to the base scenario, i.e., no charging planning and no NR are applied. © 2022 by the authors.

The energy efficiency monitoring system is considered an information support tool for the management process. An object-oriented formalization of monitoring information technology is proposed which has a block structure and contains three categories of classes (information acquisition, calculation algorithms, and control procedures). An example of the implementation of the class “Operation with the electrical grid” of information technology is presented. The planning of the freight EVs charging under power limits of the charging station (CS) was carried out using a situational algorithm based on a Fuzzy expert system. The situational algorithm provides for monitoring the charging of a freight EV at a charging station, taking into account the charge weight index (CWI) assigned to it. The optimization of the CS electrical load is carried out from the standpoint of minimizing electricity costs and ensuring the demand for EV charging without going beyond its limits. A computer simulation of the EV charging mode and the CS load was performed. The results of modeling the electrical grid and CS load using the proposed algorithm were compared with the results of modeling using a controlled charging algorithm with electrical grid limitations and an uncontrolled charging algorithm. The proposed approach provides a reduction in power consumption during peak hours of the electrical grid and charging of connected EVs for an on-demand state of charge (SOC). © 2022 by the authors.

However, in developing countries where the public transportation sector is growing quickly, energy‐environmental planning is urgently needed. This paper evaluates the future electricity demand, as well as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions reduction, due to the operation of an expected increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) in Paki-stan. The planning of EVs up to 2040 is performed with the ePop simulator that calculates the future EVs’ electricity demand, while EnergyPLAN® assesses the expected new power capacities. Two scenarios are investigated by penetrating 30% and 90% of 2/3 electric wheelers and cars by 2030 and 2040 compared to 2020, respectively. To fulfill the expected energy demand, PV in the daytime and the national electric grid at nighttime are here considered. Finally, a 9 GW of PV capacity is needed to satisfy the EVs’ electricity demand of 14.7 TWh/year, and a 0.7 GW power plants capacity is needed to fulfill 4.7 TWh/year by 2040. Consequently, EVs’ charging scenarios at daytime and nighttime are assessed.

These uncertainties—which have not been adequately considered in the literature—can entail risks in the optimal sizing of EV charging stations (EVCSs) and DG units in active distribution network planning. This paper proposes a method for obtaining the optimal sizing of DG units and EVCSs (considering uncertainty), to achieve exact power system analysis and ensure EV driver satisfaction. To model uncertainties in optimal sizing planning, this study first generates scenarios for each system asset using a probability distribution that considers the asset characteristics. In this step, the wind-turbine (WT), PV, and EVCS are modeled applying the Weibull, exponential, and kernel density estimation (KDE), and scenarios for each asset are gen-erated using random sampling. Then, the k-means clustering is carried out for scenario reduction and the representative scenario abstract. The probability of occurrence for each representative scenario is assigned depending on the number of observations within each cluster. The representative scenarios for each asset are integrated into the scenario for all assets through the joint probability. The integrated scenarios are applied in the optimization problem for optimal sizing of the system asset framework. The optimal sizing of the system assets problem is proposed (to minimize the line loss and voltage deviation) and formulated via stochastic second-order conic programming, to re-flect the uncertainty under an AC power flow; this is a convex problem that can be solved in poly-nomial time. The proposed method is tested on a modified IEEE 15 bus system, and the simulation is performed with various objective functions. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 by the authors.

In this article, the design and optimization of the sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) with power-sharing capabilities in conjunction with electric vehicles (EVs) were proposed in two case studies. Two algorithms, namely, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and multi-objective crow search (MOCS), have been formulated and were used to solve the problem being investigated. In case study 1 (CS1), four different HRESs are designed in the presence of EVs, meaning that for each HRES an EV and the power-sharing capability is employed. And also, the stochastic behavior of the EV using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is modeled. In case study 2 (CS2), four HRESs are designed with power-sharing capabilities, but in this case, for any of the HRESs, EV is not considered. This idea can be considered a novel breakthrough for the potential of power-sharing has been incorporated with the integration of EVs and HRESs. This approach improves the life cycle cost and loss of power supply probability indices. In summary, both cases in the presence and absence of EVs were compared with the simulation results. The results show that the use of the proposed EV significantly reduces the total cost of the engineered system. Furthermore, two meta-heuristic techniques were compared, and it was concluded that MOPSO had performed better than MOCS.

This is due to technical impacts caused by such LZC technologies on voltage quality, such as voltage rise, voltage drop, voltage unbalance, and on assets loading (transformer and conductors). This paper proposes a stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo simulations to estimate combined PV-PEV hosting capacity in LV networks. In addition, the proposed approach can be used to assist utility engineers to undertake planning actions based on the potential risk of violation. From the results obtained by applying the proposed approach to a real Brazilian LV network, overvoltage and unbalance voltage issues are found to be the most limiting factors of combined PV-PEV connections. Further, it is shown that the combined PV-PEV penetration levels need to be considered to avoid under or overestimations of both PV and PEV hosting capacity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Combined PV-PEV penetration; Hosting capacity analysis; Low-voltage (LV) distribution networks; Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) charging; Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems","Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Stochastic systems; Voltage distribution measurement; Capacity analysis; Combined photovoltaic-plug-in electric vehicle penetration; Hosting capacity; Hosting capacity analyse; Low carbon; Low voltage distribution network; Photovoltaics; Plug-in electric vehicle charging; Rooftop photovoltaic systems; Vehicle penetration; Plug-in electric vehicles","This work was supported by FAPEAM.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123756671"

Renewable energies offer a large source of clean energy, but they are not controllable, as they depend on weather conditions. This problem is solved by adding energy storage elements, implementing a demand response through shiftable loads, and the vehicle-to-grid/vehicle-to-home technologies. Indeed, an electric vehicle is equipped with a high-capacity battery, which can be used to store a certain amount of energy and give it back again later when required to fulfill the electricity demand and prevent an energy shortage when the main-grid power is limited for security reasons. In this context, this paper presents a comparative study between two home microgrids, in one of which the concept of vehicle-to-home is integrated to provide a case study to demonstrate the interest of this technology at the home level. The considered microgrid is composed of renewable energy resources, battery energy storage, and is connected to the main grid. As the vehicle is not available all day, in order to have consistent results, its intervention is considered in the evening, night, and early morning hours. Two case studies are carried out. In the first one, the vehicle-to-home concept is not taken into account. In this case, the system depends only on renewable resources and the energy storage system. Subsequently, the electric vehicle is considered as an additional energy storage device over a few hours. Electric vehicle integration brings an economic contribution by reducing the cost, supporting the other MG components, and relieving the main grid. Simulation results using real weather data for two cities in France, namely Brest and Toulon, show the effectiveness of the vehicle-to-home concept in terms of cost, energy self-sufficiency, and continuity of electrical service. © 2022 by the authors.

At present, most studies determine EV charging needs based on user travel paths, but they have not taken the behavior uncertainty of EV owners and the diversity of their demands into account. The probability statistics on the massive data of EV travels can help excavating the travel and charging rules of the EVs. Based on user travel data, the Markov chain and the roulette method are used to simulates EV charging requirements in three scenarios considering various uncertain factors, and then a K-means clustering algorithm is used to obtain charging requirements in three scenarios. On this basis, a bi-level planning model of charging station with maximum annual profit of construction and operation and minimum comprehensive charging cost of EVs as multi-objective function is proposed. This model also considers many constraints, such as cooperative service of multi-type charging piles, acceptance capacity of distribution network and so on. The upper model takes the location and capacity of charging station planning as control variables. The lower model was established to minimize the comprehensive charging cost of EVs. The upper and lower models interact and couple with each other. The solution process of bi-level planning model was designed through using firefly algorithm. Finally, taking the urban area of a city in China as the planning area, and the transportation network coupled with the IEEE 69 node distribution network as an example, the validity and correctness of the proposed model are verified. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-level charging station planning; Electric vehicle; Firefly algorithm; Multi-type charging piles; Uncertainty of charging demand","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; K-means clustering; Markov processes; Optimization; Urban transportation; Bi-level charging station planning; Bi-level planning; Charging demands; Charging station; Charging station planning; Electric vehicle charging; Firefly algorithms; Multi-type charging pile; Uncertainty; Uncertainty of charging demand; Piles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122816601"

This study aims to clarify the role of EV in managing curtailment in electricity grid with high PV penetration. An energy balance analysis was conducted to assess the impact of various EV adoption rates and PV capacity growth rates on curtailment throughout a 10-year planning period. Results show that EV as mobile storage has a significant impact in reducing curtailment. In the case of Kyushu, Japan, the analysis showed that 20 GWh was sufficient by 2031. It will require 300,000 to 570,000 electric vehicles as mobile storage to reach this capacity, depending on the combinations of EV classes used. Additional capacity will only benefit spring and autumn, which does not merit an increased target due to the low capacity factor. Following the logistics growth model, the current adaption rate is insufficient to reach target volume, and external support will be necessary. EV as mobile storage can keep the curtailment to around 10%–15% but has less impact initially; thus, stalling the additional capacity until sufficient EV capacity is available might be necessary to keep the curtailment below 10%. Overall, EV as secondary storage is ideal for regions experiencing PV curtailment, and cars are only used for specific activities. © 2021 The Author(s)","Electric vehicles; Energy balance; Mobile storage; Scenario analysis; Solar curtailment","Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Capacity growth; Electricity grids; Energy balance analysis; Impact assessments; Mobile storage; Renewable energies; Scenarios analysis; Secondary storage; Solar curtailment; Transport sectors; Energy balance","The authors are grateful for the financial support from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan for the doctoral studies of Samuel Matthew Dumlao at Kyoto University.

Two EV charging scenarios were tested, one using an aggregated fixed charging profile based on existing literature and another where the charging demand was optimized by the power system based on least cost. The results showed that additional capacity was required to meet the demand. For both scenarios, the least-cost capacity investment technologies chosen were the same, although the quantities differed.

The increasing penetration of uncertain wind power generation and transportation networks via EV charging stations has introduced challenges for system operators to manage power systems and market operations. In this context, this paper presents a stochastic AC security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model to clear day-ahead energy and reserve markets considering transportation–electricity networks through EV charging stations in the presence of uncertain wind power and generator contingency. Pre-contingency ranking is a common strategy for reducing the time of the SCUC problem, but it provides high-impact outages. To address this issue, generator outages ranked first are identified using the post-contingency generator response ranking approach. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a structure with the most effective outages in the presence of uncertain wind power and transportation networks. The stochastic optimization approach is modeled through scenarios with corresponding probabilities to manage the wind uncertainty. The computationally complex proposed model is solved by a prominent bender decomposition approach. Case studies are shown on a modified IEEE 118-bus system with 26 nodes and 74 connected links of the electricity transportation network. The results show that optimal EV travel scheduling can optimize the transportation network and a sufficient energy reserve, confirming the security of the power system with minimum operating cost. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","bender's decomposition; electric vehicle; generator response; stochastic security-constrained unit commitment; transportation network; wind uncertainty","Commerce; Electric network parameters; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Network security; Outages; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Benders' decompositions; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Energy markets; Generator response; Reserve markets; Stochastic security constrained unit commitments; Transportation network; Wind generator systems; Wind uncertainties; Wind power","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118801818"

The sustainability of this transition requires a coordinated approach for planning of charging stations integrated with solar photovoltaic (SPV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) with due consideration to the power distribution and transportation network. A two-stage multiobjective planning framework is proposed to find effective service radius, optimal sites, and sizing of fast charging electric vehicle stations (FCEVS), photovoltaic (PV) plants, and battery energy storage systems (BESS). The dynamics of EV charging demand are estimated using EV flow modeling in the M1/M2/N queuing model for the transportation network, which incorporates EV population with multiple battery capacities and waiting time constraints. The multiobjective grey wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithm is used in the first stage to obtain a nondominated solution set for EVCS and PV siting and sizing. The best solution from the nondominated solution set is then obtained using fuzzy satisfaction-based selection. In the second stage, the bisection point method is used iteratively to obtain adequate BESS capacity as well as additional PV capacity required to support EV load during peak traffic hours. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is investigated using a 25-node transportation network coupled to an IEEE 123-bus distribution test system for several scenarios integrating seasonal irradiance and traffic patterns. The findings demonstrate a cost-effective placement of FCEVS with reduction in active power losses, voltage variation, and increased capture of EV flow. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","battery energy storage system; distribution network; electric vehicle charging station; optimization; solar PV","Battery management systems; Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Multiobjective optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Queueing theory; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Battery energy storage systems; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Multi-objective planning; Optimisations; Planning framework; Solar photovoltaic energies; Solar photovoltaics; Transportation network; Iterative methods","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118656628"

In this paper, we present the 3D-PV-Locator for large-scale detection of roof-mounted PV systems in three dimensions (3D). The 3D-PV-Locator combines information extracted from aerial images and 3D building data by means of deep neural networks for image classification and segmentation, as well as 3D spatial data processing techniques. It thereby extends existing approaches for the automated detection of PV systems from aerial images by also providing their azimuth and tilt angles. We evaluate the 3D-PV-Locator using a large dataset gathered from the official German PV registry in a real-world study with more than one million buildings. In terms of azimuth and tilt angles, our evaluation shows that the 3D-PV-Locator and the official registry coincide for about two thirds of the observations and are within neighboring classes for 84 and 99 percent of the observations, respectively. In terms of detected PV system capacity, we show that the 3D-PV-Locator clearly outperforms existing approaches. It performs particularly well for the groups of small and medium-sized PV systems (3.6–33.1 percent error reduction) and PV systems tilted beyond 40° (25.6–38.1 percent error reduction). The 3D PV system data generated by the 3D-PV-Locator can inform several practical applications, such as improved forecasting of solar generation, the optimized planning and operation of distribution networks, improved integration of electric vehicles, and others.

This research presents a hierarchical optimization strategy, for improving the safe and economical operation of DN considering the DGs and EVs integration. In Stage 1, the MPPT control model of DGs is designed to obtain the best energy conversion efficiency. In Stage 2, load models of EVs and battery energy storage system (BESS) under coordinate charging/discharging stimulated by a time-of-use incentive mechanism are established respectively, to achieve a load curve with a minimized peak-to-valley difference (PVD). In Stage 3, aiming for the best compromise between the active power loss and node voltage excursion, daily optimal scheduling of the static Var compensator (SVC) capacitors is dynamically worked out according to the varying power demand, as the solution for the defined multi-objective optimization problem. For enhancing the convergence speed, an advanced genetic algorithm with elite preservation strategy is employed. The proposed hierarchical strategy is demonstrated on an IEEE 33-node DN test case, and the simulation results show that first, the MPPT control ensures the maximum power outputs of DGs; next, power supply pressure could be relieved by the load shifting effects of the coordinated vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service and BESS configuration, reflected in the decreased load peak from 4,370.1 to 3,424.99 kW, and the optimized PVD from 1763.8 to 703.8 kW; meanwhile, via applicable power planning of the SVC components, optimized power loss and voltage quality can both be achieved, proving the feasibility of the optimization strategy, which promotes the economic and reliable operation of the DN system. © © 2022 Huang, Ma, Wang, Fang and Zhang.","coordinated dispatch; distributed generators; distribution network; electric vehicles; multi-objective optimization; vehicle-to-grid","Charging (batteries); Conversion efficiency; Distributed power generation; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Genetic algorithms; Static Var compensators; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery energy storage systems; Coordinated dispatch; Distributed generators; Electric vehicle integrations; Hierarchical strategies; MPPT controls; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization strategy; Smart grid constructions; Vehicle to grids; Multiobjective optimization","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (2017JJ5044), the Scientific Research Foundation of Hunan Provincial Education Department (20C0613, 21C0428), and the Hunan High-Tech Industry Science and Technology Innovation Leading Foundation of China (2022GK4055).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127346558"

Meanwhile, decentralized and complex grid edge faces many challenges for planning, operation, and management of power systems. Therefore, providing a reliable communications infrastructure is vital. The fourth industrial revolution, that is, a cyber-physical system in conjunction with the Internet of Things (IoT) and coexistence of edge (fog) and cloud computing brings new ways of dealing with such challenges and helps maximize the benefits of power grids. From this perspective, as a use case of IoV, we present a cloud-based EV charging framework to tackle issues of high demand in charging stations during peak hours. A price incentive scheme and another scheme, electricity supply expansion, are presented and compared with the baseline. The results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical models improve the system performance and the quality of service (QoS) for EV customers. The proposed methods can efficiently assist system operators in managing the system design and grid stability. Further, to shed light on emerging technologies for smart and connected EVs, we elaborate on seven major trends: decentralized energy trading based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology, behavioral science and behavioral economics, artificial and computational intelligence and its applications, digital twins of IoV, software-defined IoVs, and intelligent EV charging with information-centric networking, and parking lot microgrids and EV-based virtual storage.

We formulate an integrated optimization platform for estimating electric vehicle charging infrastructure placement in home and non-home locations simultaneously that include infrastructure costs and dynamic electricity prices with a mixed-integer linear programming. We provide two case studies in the Great Sacramento Area and San Diego, California. The results show that higher non-home charging opportunity informed by the empirical travel and dwelling patterns offers more potentials for a shared public charging system in San Diego, resulting in 14−30% lower in total system cost and 21−25% lower in emissions. This indicates that the heterogeneity in spatial and temporal travel and dwelling patterns substantially affect the design of the charging infrastructure system, and significantly change the energy, economic and environmental impacts of the system. We also observe sensible timing of charging in non-home locations that correspond to daytime hours and a secondary peak in charging at home locations during nighttime hours in both regions, emphasizing the importance of integrating grid dynamics into EV charging infrastructures planning process. Our model platform provides new insights on how to properly allocate EV charging infrastructures and manage charging activities from a comprehensive and disaggregated perspective combined with power grid smoothing. © 2022 The Authors","Electric vehicle charging station; Greenhouse gas; Grid impact; Optimization","Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Integer programming; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging infrastructures; Charging station; Dwelling patterns; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Electric vehicle charging station; Greenhouses gas; Grid impacts; Optimisations; Travel patterns; Location; carbon emission; electric vehicle; greenhouse gas; modeling; optimization; spatiotemporal analysis; transportation infrastructure; travel behavior; California; Sacramento; San Diego; United States","We would like to thank the Alfred P.

From these, we generate travel and plug-in behaviors by using a Monte Carlo approach to derive CFs. By varying the EV battery size, the rated charging power, and the plug-in behavior, their influence on the CF is examined. The key results show that the CF decreases to less than 25% when considering more than 50 EVs with a charging level of 11 kW, with the CF strongly depending on the number of EVs considered. By contrast, the driving behavior and the battery size have a minor influence on the CF. Furthermore, when mixing the parameters, such as EV battery size and rated charging power, then, especially, the active power drawn by the feeder does not change linearly. Ultimately, the study aims to add to the state-of-the-art by solely and systematically focusing on the CF and its sensitivity to a number of key factors.

This paper presents a standardized framework for micro-scale analysis of potential charging locations for electric buses aiming at easing the analysis process and promoting the expansion of electric buses. The framework is tailor-made for the Municipality of Stockholm and tested in two city-centre public transport hubs, namely Odenplan and Slussen. However, the framework can be used in other locations by implementing minimum changes. Connecting charging stations to the power grid is identified as the main drawback in city-centre locations due to their high impact on the grid. Lack of available capacity at nearby connection points results in long distance connections, reaching up to 1 km in some cases. Such connections impact the overall cost of electrification directly, as they may account for up to 63% of the total cost. Although other issues regarding space availability and operational efficiency also need to be addressed, such as the lack of enough dwell time to charge the batteries, the framework proves the suitability of these inner-city locations as charging points. © 2021","Charging infrastructure; Electric buses; Framework; Public transport; Sweden","Bus transportation; Buses; Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Expansion; Case-studies; Charging infrastructures; Charging station; City centers; Electric bus; Electromobility; Framework; Public transport; Stockholm; Sweden; Location; bus transport; electric vehicle; environmental assessment; inner city area; transportation development; transportation planning; Stockholm [Sweden]","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121967147"

This, however, will change power grid landscapes and potentially impose uncertainties in short and long term grid planning. The solution to quantify randomness of intermittent events is to implement probabilistic power flow (PPF) analysis. The computation of PPF due to myriad sources of unknown uncertainties is very expensive. This computation analysis becomes more complex when inter-period temporal-spatial correlation and multivariate uncertainties are considered. This paper addresses the issue by resorting to a novel hybrid nonparametric algorithm for short-term PPF analysis in radial distribution networks. The proposed algorithm deals with probabilistic nonlinear loads, unit generators including PV panels, Wind farms, and EVCS charging pattern. Temporal correlation characterized by memory coefficient is used to model inter-event temporal correlation (IETC) over multiple time steps. Detailed uncertainty modeling of PEVs driving and their queues at EVCSs are included. The proposed method is superior over other existing numerical methods as it accounts for the multivariate inter temporal uncertainty events of RES and PEVs charging. Simulation results in a spatio-temporally correlated IEEE 34 node radial distribution system revealed that using IETC coefficients leads to improved prediction accuracy with average error less than 2.5% and improves the computation burden. The proposed method is applied to IEEE 123 node to test the performance of our proposed method. A comparative analysis is done with other well-known analytical/numerical methods. The PPF Computation time of our proposed method is shown to be faster than other methods when IETC is implemented. The results show insensitivity of our proposed method to the size of the system. © 2021","Distribution networks; Inter-event time correlation; Plug-in electric vehicles; Probabilistic power flow; Soft clustering method","Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Numerical methods; Photovoltaic cells; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Charging station; Clustering methods; Inter-event time correlation; Probabilistic power flow; Renewable energy source; Soft clustering; Soft clustering method; Temporal correlations; Time correlations; Uncertainty; Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119591050"

For this aim, we first develop an empirical operating model considering operating characteristics of the distribution system with the BSS explicitly. Then, on this basis, a rolling optimization scheduling model of the distribution network is established. In particular, a refined BSS model including a new calculation method of available generation capacity (AGC) is included. Finally, a quantitative method to quantify the effect of BSS on reliability and economy of distribution networks is proposed. Compared with existing works, the main contribution of this paper is threefold. (i) A battery-level BSS operational model including AGC calculation is proposed to fully explore the V2G potential of the BSS. (ii) A rolling optimization scheduling model is established, which fully exploits the potential interaction between economy and reliability of system operation. (iii) An assessment framework is proposed to analyze the special value of BSS resources from aspects of both economy improvement and reliability enhancement, which can provide more practical instruction for BSS planning. Numerical studies are conducted based on IEEE 33-bus distribution network to verify the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. The simulation results show that if V2G of the BSS is orderly exploited and managed, the net profit of the distribution system will increase by 11.97%, and system expected energy not supplied (SEENS) will decrease by 14.34%.

This flexibility can be best exploited by DC power networks, as they allow charging and discharging without extra power electronics and transformation losses. From the grid control perspective, algorithms for planning EV charging are necessary. This paper studies the problem of EV charging planning under limited grid capacity and extends it to the partially observable case. We demonstrate how limited information about the EV locations in a grid may disrupt the operation planning in DC grids with tight constraints. We introduce two methods to change the grid topology such that partial observability of the EV locations is resolved. The suggested models are evaluated on the IEEE 16 bus system and multiple randomly generated grids with varying capacities. The experiments show that these methods efficiently solve the partially observable EV charging planning problem and offer a trade-off between computational time and performance. © 2022 by the authors.

A cost-effective system integration of electrified transport would therefore not be possible without the implementation of smart charging concepts in combination with strategic network expansion planning that considers the impact of uncertainties.

Additionally, it presents a multi-stage stochastic planning framework that can identify optimal investment strategies such that the expected system cost is minimized and the risk of stranded investments is reduced. The models are demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus test system and applied in a case study of the power system of Great Britain. The results highlight G2V, V2G and V2B as effective non-network alternatives to conventional reinforcement that could generate substantial economic savings and act as hedging instruments against uncertainty. For the case of Great Britain, the Option Values of G2V, V2G, and V2B could amount to £1.2bn, £10.8bn, and £10.1bn, respectively, over a 40-year horizon. Although the quantified values are system-specific, the paper presents key observations on the role of smart charging concepts as investment options that can be generalized for any low-carbon power system. © 2021","Electric vehicles; Grid-to-vehicle; Option Value; Smart charging; Stochastic optimization; Transmission planning; Uncertainty; Vehicle-to-building; Vehicle-to-grid","","This research was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under grant number EP/R045518/1 (IDLES) and by Innovate UK under grant number 104227 (e4Future).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123799630"

Several studies show that improved matching between PV generation and EV load through both optimal sizing and operation of PV-EV systems can minimize these challenges. This paper presents an optimal PV-EV sizing framework for workplace solar powered charging stations considering load matching performances. The proposed optimal sizing framework in this study uses a novel score, called self-consumption-sufficiency balance (SCSB), which conveys the balance between self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS), based on a similar principle as the F1-score in machine learning. A high SCSB score implies that the system is close to being self-sufficient without exporting or curtailing a large share of local production. The results show that the SCSB performance tends to be higher with a larger combined PV-EV size. In addition to presenting PV-EV optimal sizing at the workplace charging station, this study also assesses a potential SC and SS enhancement with optimal operation through smart charging schemes. The results show that smart charging schemes can significantly improve the load matching performances by up to 42.6 and 40.8 percentage points for SC and SS, respectively. The smart charging scheme will also shift the combined optimal PV-EV sizes. Due to its simplicity and universality, the optimal sizing based on SCSB score proposed in this study can be a benchmark for future studies on optimal sizing of PV-EV system, or distributed generation-load in general. © 2021 The Authors","Electric vehicle charging; Optimal sizing; Photovoltaic systems; PV self-consumption; Smart charging; Workplace charging station","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Silicon compounds; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Charging scheme; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Optimal sizing; Photovoltaic self-consumption; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Smart charging; Solar-powered; Workplace charging station; Photovoltaic cells; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; solar power","This study was conducted as part of the research project ‘Smart charging strategies and optimal PV-EV sizing to increase the combined PV-EV hosting capacity in the distribution grid’, funded through SweGRIDS, by the Swedish Energy Agency .

To coordinate the load levels of the coupled power distribution network and transportation network, we propose an integrated pricing strategy including road tolls and charging prices, which depend on the road traffic load rate in the transportation network and the bus load rate in the power distribution network, respectively. To accurately model the interdependency between the power distribution network and the transportation network, a proper interface equation is proposed. Considering data privacy, we adopt a distributed optimization. Furthermore, we present a power allocation strategy based on model predictive control to meet the charging requirements of different EVs. Correspondingly, the above ideas form a two-layer optimization strategy. Based on the integrated pricing strategy, the upper layer aims to minimize the power generation cost and transportation travel cost, while balancing the load levels. The lower layer distributes charging power to different EVs based on the total power demand from the interface equation between the power distribution network and the transportation network.

Renewable energies like wind power, biomass, hydropower, solar power, and geothermal energies are preferred for production as they do not run out quickly. Owing to the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) load demand, large-scale penetration of these resources from the power system affects the network performance like reduce power quality, increase power loss, and voltage deviation. These issues can be addressed by the optimum planning depending upon the variables outcome in RES to satisfy the extra demand affected by PHEV charging. At the same time, designing a proper and effective energy management strategy in PHEV can be considered an optimization problem and can be resolved by the use of metaheuristic algorithms. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel deep learning with metaheuristic optimization based allocation of RES and charging stations for PHEVs. The proposed model depends upon model predictive control (MPC) where the actual battery state of charge (SOC) is concerned with real time energy management. Moreover, the black widow optimization (BWO) algorithm is used for the optimal allocation of RES and charging stations. The BWO algorithm derives objective functions using different parameters of the charging stations. In addition, based on the MPC model, deep stacked autoencoder (DSAE) is applied for the prediction of near-future velocity. The experimental results stated that the presented model has resulted in improved efficiency of the proposed model over the other methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Charging stations; Deep learning; Metaheuristics; Model predictive control; PHEVs; Renewable energy; State of charge","Charging (batteries); Deep learning; Electric losses; Geothermal energy; Optimization; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Predictive control systems; Solar energy; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Charging station; Metaheuristic; Model-predictive control; Optimal allocation; Optimization algorithms; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; States of charges; Model predictive control; alternative energy; comparative study; efficiency measurement; heuristics; machine learning; renewable resource; solar power","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118501136"

The proposed methodology allows the selection of type, capacity, and location of battery energy storage systems in distribution networks with distributed generation and electric vehicle charging stations. A mixed-integer stochastic programming problem is cunningly approached with a metaheuristic, where fitness calculation with stochastic scenarios is performed by introducing an approximation to the operation costs in the form of a polynomial neural network, generated according to the Group Method of Data Handling—GMDH method, with strong computing speeding-up. The quality of this approximation for heavy Monte Carlo simulations is assessed in a first case study using a 33-bus distribution test system. The optimization planning model is then validated in the same test system using real data collected from solar and wind sources, demand, prices, and charging stations.

These environmental concerns drive many nations to commit themselves in pursuing sustainable energy resources. Different process integration techniques have been developed to achieve a viable energy planning sector. In reference to the literature review, the use of time-sliced based models in optimization problems is still sparse. Hence, this paper aims to develop a time-sliced based optimization model that can be integrated into energy integration models. With that, a multi-period pinch-based methodology (targeting, scheduling, and optimization) for electric power systems with the hybridization of renewables and fossil-based energy is proposed. The prospective framework is designed to meet the emissions limit, fulfil energy demand, and minimize the electricity bill. An illustrative case study in Malaysia incorporated with an actual billing system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

To evaluate the feasibility of coupling V2G with IES as a flexible storage, we propose an optimisation-based system planning framework embedding V2G into IES. Within this framework, stochastic features of electric vehicles (EV) fleets are simulated. The impacts of V2G on IES design are captured by assessing both economic and environmental benefits via multi-objective optimisations utilising an improved NSGA-II algorithm. Six case studies considering three cities with different climate conditions and two functional areas of residential and commercial are performed. The results manifest that Beijing-commercial case could achieve the largest mutual benefits. The EV fleets’ charging behaviour follows the time-of-use energy tariff in transition seasons while not during winter. Sensitivity analysis indicates the electricity and gas prices have significant impact on the system design. The benefits induced by growing EV penetration would gradually decrease and stabilise when the EV number reach 300, the growth of economic and environmental benefits stabilized at 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. Overall, this study quantifies the benefits of enabling V2G in IES, and generates valuable insights for IES planners, V2G service providers, and relevant policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Feasibility assessment; Flexible energy storage; Integrated energy system; Multi-objective optimisation; Vehicle to grid","Charging (batteries); Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Economic and environmental benefits; Feasibility assessment; Flexible energy storage; Flexible storage; Integrated energy systems; Multi-objectives optimization; System coupling; Vehicle fleets; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle to grids; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; energy efficiency; energy market; energy planning; energy storage; feasibility study; integrated approach; optimization; policy making; Beijing [China]; China","H.W. would like to thank for the support from the China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201906030036 ).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116383109"

A voltage stability index (VSI) was used in the optimization process to determine the predefined search space for CB locations, and a double-direction learning strategy (DLS) was then considered to optimize the locations and sizes while maintaining a balance between the exploration and exploitation phases. Three IEEE RDNs were used to simulate various EV load increase scenarios as well as typical loading situations. According to a comparison with the literature, the IPFA produced global optimum results, and the proposed CBs allocation approach demonstrated enhanced performance in RDNs under all scenarios of EV load growth. © 2022, University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Science.

The optimal planning of RCS considering only distribution networks is not a reli-able approach.

In this paper, a multi-objective approach for optimal planning of RCS and Distributed Generators (DG) in a distributed system coupled with a transportation network is analyzed. The proposed optimal planning method aims to achieve reduced active power loss, EV user costs, and voltage deviation for effective RCS and DG planning. The approach in-cludes the analysis of the test system with the base case, solo planning of RCS, planning of DGs with fixed RCS, and simultaneous optimal planning of RCS and DGs. Daily load variation at buses and hourly charging probability of EVs have been used in the analysis.

In this context, load flow methodologies that consider non-probabilistic uncertainty due to a lack of data (particularly concerning EV) seem to be a handy tool to analyze network congestion situations and to support electrical network planning. The congestion of the branches is related to the load and generation of the network buses. Still, the congestion of a specific branch may not be related to the load and generation on the neighbouring buses. In this line, Fuzzy Power Flow (FPF) is suitable for identifying congestion situations in the transmission system and the branches responsible for such cases when probabilistic models may not describe uncertainty. This paper uses an FPF model, a non-linearized Constrained Fuzzy Power Flow (CFPF), to characterize congestion situations in transmission network planning. The application of the CFPF to analyze congestion situations is a novelty. The results of that application may be used to define the reinforcement of the most appropriate branches to achieve specific suitability of the network in the face of a diverse set of uncertainties. Furthermore, the dual values provided by Lagrange multipliers resulting from the CFPF optimization problem are used to identify the most promising options to mitigate congestion situations. © 2022 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Congestion; Constrained; Fuzzy; Power Flow; Severity; Transmission; Uncertainty","","Funding text 1: This work is funded by National Funds through the FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P., within the scope of the project Refª UIDB/05583/2020.

Electricity, water, buildings, transport networks, and communication systems are each delivered separately. Recent advancements in the development of energy micro-grids have opened the possibility of localised, intensive, and complex, nature-based infrastructure ecosystems. Designed at the scale of a village, such systems would integrate different types of infrastructure. For example, an energy micro-grid can provide electricity to buildings, power electric vehicles and cycle water through a precinct. In turn, the water system can store energy and irrigate a diverse, regenerative food system. Providing housing close to food production reduces transport costs, supply chain losses and packaging. The significant land area required for each village would result in a dispersal of populations, creating networks of villages, each with integrated infrastructure ecosystems. This challenges the orthodoxy in town planning and regional economics that accepts ever-increasing urbanisation. To synthesise ideas developed in different disciplines we adopt the epistemology of consilience. That is, a conclusion can be confirmed when different disciplines arrive at that same position. We show that literature in town planning, regional economics, ecological economics, and public health all support the argument for dispersal reached through civil engineering systems. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","infrastructure ecosystems; regional economics; steady state economy; thermodynamics; Town planning","Ecosystems; Electric power transmission networks; Regional planning; Rural areas; Supply chains; Urban planning; Centralized systems; Civil infrastructures; Energy; Human settlements; Infrastructure ecosystem; Microgrid; Regional economic; Steady state; Steady state economy; Town planning; Thermodynamics; civil engineering; ecological economics; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy storage; food production; irrigation; public health; regional economy; thermodynamics; town planning; urbanization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139207762"

Despite the complexity of their protection, as well as the operation of distributed generation resources in the distribution network, factors such as improving reliability, increasing production capacity of the distribution network, stabilizing the voltage of the distribution network, reducing peak clipping losses, as well as economic and environmental considerations, have expanded the influence of distributed generation (DG) resources in the distribution network. The location of DG sources and their capacity are the key factors in the effectiveness of distributed generation in the voltage stability of distribution systems. Nowadays, along with the scattered production sources of electric vehicles with the ability to connect to the network, due to having an energy storage system, they are known as valuable resources that can provide various services to the power system. These vehicles can empower the grid or be used as a storage supply source when parked and connected to the grid. This paper introduces and studies a two-stage planning framework for the concurrent management of many electric vehicles and distributed generation resources with private ownership. In the first stage, the aim is to increase the profit of electric vehicles and distributed generation sources; finally, the purpose is to reduce operating costs. The proposed scheduling framework is tested on a distribution network connected to bus 5 of the RBTS sample network. Besides distributed generation sources and electric vehicles, we integrate timeconsistent load management into the system. Due to distributed generation sources such as photovoltaic systems and wind turbines and the studied design in the modeling, we use the Taguchi TOAT algorithm to generate and reduce the scenario to ensure the uncertainty in renewable energy.

Recharging of EVs should be carried out repeatedly over time, and the energy needed for this is high and increasing. With the present infrastructure, we cannot supply the required energy, and therefore, we need to implement a model that expands the power grid to satisfy our energy requirements. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network-based dynamic capacity expansion (CNN-DCE) for EV charging. Flower pollination optimization algorithm (FPOA) was used to improve the hyperparameters of CNN during training. The main aim is to reduce the cost of installing additional capacity resources and to reduce the operational cost. To cope with the load growth, different capacity resources are installed at different years of the planning boundary. Five statistical indices, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, correlation coefficient, and scatter index, are used to evaluate the performance of CNN. The capacity expansion plan in the microgrid is achieved by expanding the energy of battery energy storage systems, microturbines, and solar and wind energy systems. The queuing delay for the EVs waiting in a queue for recharging has been considered. The performance of the proposed CNN-DCE is studied and compared with three other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the resources reduce the planning cost to 26% for the short-term planning horizon, the long-term plan has 150% of the expansion, and the wind energy system covers 48% of the expansion cost. © 2022 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

Similarly, effective SOPs integration in the IEEE 69-bus resulted in a loss reduction of 81.07 percent.

The proposed hybrid approach is to work in conjunction with Mexican Axolotl optimization (MAO) and Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO) hence it is named as MAOWHO approach. The major purposes of the proposed approach are to site and size of the electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL) and to improve the benefit of EVPL for the participation of the reserve market. In addition, power loss and voltage fluctuations occur due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EV) demand load, which is reduced by the proposed approach. To optimally determine the size of the parking lot, the MAOWHO approach is adopted. The integration of the EV and PV systems, especially in parking lots, enhances the reliability and flexibility of the electrical system at critical moments. Multiple objective optimization problems are calculated to achieve objective variables to reduce power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and supply costs, and EV costs. The location and capacity of the RES and EV charging stations in this optimization problem are objective variables. The MAOWHO approach enhances Solar Powered Electric Vehicle Parking Lot (EVSPL) participation in various energy and ancillary service markets that includes the effects of capacity payments. Besides, the implementation of MAOWHO approach is done by the MATLAB/Simulink platform and the performance of the MAOWHO approach is compared to the existing approaches.

The goal of this study is to determine the charging/discharging of PV energy-integrated energy storage system (PV-ESS), EV charging price, and demand response (DR) incentive values considering voltage management. To achieve the optimal energy operation for a distribution network, this study proposes an evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based new scheduling strategy, considering voltage management for a multi-agent system (MAS). The EGT, which is a decision-making strategy, is used by agents to cooperate and derive the best scheduling with their own behavior pattern functions to minimize the system operating cost. Photovoltaic-energy storage systems, electric vehicles charging power, and loads can perform charging/discharging scheduling, electric vehicle charging planning, and demand response participation, respectively. Under DSO supervision, a reward that stabilizes the voltage profile of the power distribution system is also implemented during the cooperation process. The proposed energy scheduling strategy combines an EGT-based decision-making with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the optimization problem and determine the payoff function through self-evolutionary improvement.

In this direction, the use of electric vehicles (EV), known as ultra-low carbon emission vehicles, has become widespread in addition to renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generations. The trend of EVs to be preferred the primary means of transport has revealed the effects of charging an additional load on the grid. There is a need to create coordinated charging methods by considering the approaches for real-time charging models of EVs. In this paper, SOC-based EV coordinated charging was proposed for power management to prevent adverse effects including transformer overload, instantaneous peak loading and line overload in the existing distribution network. The proposed coordinated EV charging method was tested on the modified Roy Billinton test system (RBTS) Bus 2 network. AC 11 kW uncoordinated charging units have been respectively 123.76% distribution transformer and 115.16% distribution line overloading for 500 EVs on the grid with 13,9% diversity factor. However, these values that are 72.05% of distribution transformer and 67.01% of distribution grid overloading according to permittable level were decreased by the proposed coordinated charging method. Also, the state of charge (SOC) based coordinated method can increase 3.5% rate the diversity factor of charging capacity at the charging station with PV and battery energy system (BES) while ensured grid stability and energy efficiency. © TÜBİTAK","energy efficiency; EV charging coordination; photovoltaic power generation; power management","Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Electric transformer testing; Electric transformers; Power management; Solar energy; Clean energy; Coordinated charging; Distribution systems; Distribution transformer; Diversity factors; Electrical energy; Energy generations; EV Charging; EV charging coordination; Photovoltaic power generation; Energy efficiency","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128283307"

The electrification of automobiles is an inevitable trend of future development. However, the growth of EVs relies on several elements: autonomy, the charging practice and infrastructure, the price, and the high amount of energy needed for supplying EV. This tendency impacts several points in transportation such as the road infrastructure and electrical power network. The aim of this article is the integration of new energy power sources as a part of the microgrid (MG) to supply EV with dynamic wireless charging. The main goal is to establish an energy management strategy reducing the running cost. The purpose is suggested for two kinds of operation mode: relying only on the MG (island mode) or relying on the MG and the large grid (grid-connected). The optimization problem is solved on the basis of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. We could note that the stability of the microgrid in the off-grid mode is better, when the load is close to the output power of the distributed power supply. Through the coordination and cooperation of the battery output and the other two distributed power generation units, the microgrid can achieve its autonomy and maximize the economy of the system operation. Thanks to our methodology, a better revenue and an enhanced flexible dispatching of the system were met in the grid-connected mode as well. © © 2022 Salma Sraidi and Mohamed Maaroufi.","","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Inductive power transmission; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Electrical power networks; Energies (power); Energy; Inevitable trends; Microgrid; New energies; Optimal planning; Power sources; Road infrastructures; Wireless charging; Economics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126803838"

However, there is a huge gap between energy demand and supply due to the rise of different electric products and electric vehicles. Renewable Energy Harvesting (REH) plays a critical role in managing this demand response gap, where energy is generated from various renewable energy resources such as Solar PhotoVoltaic (SPV) and wind energy. Several research works exist in this regard. However, they have not yet been exploited fully. So, this paper proposed AI-RSREH approach, i.e., the AI-empowered Recommender System for REH in residential houses. The main goal of the proposed AI-RSREH approach is to predict energy generation based on SPV accurately, and this study aims to minimize the gap between the actual generation of energy and the predicted energy generation along with a recommender system for SPV installation. An exploratory residential house-wise data analytics is conducted for the demand response gap. AI-RSREH uses a stacked Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict energy generation with a recommender system based on the energy generation prediction result.

The resulting driver “range anxiety” greatly affects the travel quality of EVs. These limitations should be overcome to promote the use of EVs.

First, based on real-time road conditions, a dynamic energy model of EVs was established considering the driving energy and accessory energy. Second, a multi-objective travel path planning model of EVs was constructed considering the power supply, taking the distance, time, energy, and charging cost as the optimization objectives. Finally, taking the actual traffic network of 15 km×15 km area in a city as the research object, the model was simulated and verified in MATLAB based on Dijkstra shortest path algorithm.

This work modeled a household energy management comprising a microgrid (MG) system and demand response programs (DRPs). Residential loads with price-based tariffs are introduced to reduce peak load demands and energy costs. For incorporating the uncertainties in RERs, their stochastic nature is modeled with a probabilistic method. This paper proposes a joint optimization approach for the optimal planning and operation of grid-connected residential, rural MG integrated into renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs) in view of DRPs. The investigation focuses on energy saving of residential homes under different DRPs and RERs integration. The EVs are integrated into MG by including photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), fuel cell (FC), and diesel engines (DEs). A multi-objective optimization problem has been formulated to minimize the operating cost, pollutant treatment cost, and carbon emissions cost defined as C1, C2, and C3, respectively. The load demand has been rescheduled because of three DRPs, i.e., critical peak pricing (CPP), real-time electricity pricing (RTEP), and time of use (TOU). Further, the EV load has also been analyzed in autonomous and coordinated charging strategies. Using a judgement matrix, the proposed multi-objective problem is transformed into a single-objective problem. The results of an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm are compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The simulation analysis was accomplished by employing ABC and PSO in MATLAB. The mathematical model of MG was implemented, and the effects of DRPs based MG were investigated under different numbers of EVs and load data to reduce different costs. To analyze the impact of DRPs, the residential, rural MG is implemented for 50 homes with a peak load of 5 kW each and EV load with 80 EVs and 700 EVs, respectively. The simulation results with different test cases are formulated while analyzing the tradeoff between ABC and PSO algorithms. The simulation analysis shows that multiple DRPs, EVs, and RERs offered a substantial trade-off. © 2013 IEEE.","Demand response programs (DRPs); Distributed generations (DG); Electric vehicles (EVs); Joint sequential optimization; Multi-objective optimization; Residential microgrids","Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Fuel cells; Genetic algorithms; Housing; MATLAB; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Demand response program; Demand response programs; Distributed generation; Electric vehicle; Joint sequential optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Power- generations; Renewable energy source; Residential microgrid; Resource management; Sequential optimization; Uncertainty; Distributed power generation","This work was supported in part by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea under Grant 20204010600340; and in part by the Energy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Convergence Research & Development Program through the National Information Technology (IT) Industry Promotion Agency of Korea (NIPA) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT under Grant S1601-20-1011.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122884451"

The promotion of V2G mode needs to consider the effectiveness of policy costs, so it is urgent to estimate the potential benefits of V2G. In this paper, a multi-regional power dispatch and expansion model is constructed from the perspective of power system by taking China's plan to reach 1.2 billion kW of installed wind and photovoltaic power generation capacity in 2030 as an example, combining with the development planning of electric vehicles and power systems. The results show that by 2030, the implementation of unidirectional V2G and bidirectional V2G in China can reduce the total cost of power system by 2.02% and 2.08%, reduce the annual carbon emissions of the power system by 2.27% and 2.95%, and increase the total proportion of wind and photovoltaic power generation by 1.33% and 1.28% in the power mix.

However, with the increase of the number and scale of EVCS, the economic problems of EVCS operation are becoming more and more prominent, and there are many problems in their operation, all of which affect the economic and social benefits of EVCS. In order to improve the economic operation of EVCS, this paper adopts Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-Interpretative Structural Modeling (DEMATEL-ISM) method to identify and analyse its influencing factors. According to the opinions of experts and EVCS enterprises, the influencing factors system of economic operation of EVCS is constructed by Delphi method, including four aspects of planning, external environment, management and technology. Based on the analysis results of multilevel hierarchical structure model, the influencing factors of EVCS economic operation can be divided into four levels. Among them, the top-level factors include charging price, gasoline price, electric vehicle battery, reliability of power supply, and spare parts management. The factors in the second layer include charging monitoring system and safety management. The third level factors include charging station address, charging station scale, regional power grid situation, government policy, technical supervision management, operation data analysis and management, personal training management. The third level elements directly affect the second level factors and have an impact on the first level factors through the second level factors. Furthermore, it is also found that the number of electric vehicles is the deepest factor and the most basic segment which affects the economic operation of EVCS and the other factors. This method is feasible and can be utilized to quantitatively analyse the influencing factors of economic operation of EVCS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","DEMATEL; Economic operation; Electric vehicle charging station; Influencing factors; ISM","Charging (batteries); Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Factor analysis; Information management; Charging station; Decisions makings; DEMATEL; Economic operations; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Influencing factor; ISM; Second level; Third level; Decision making","This work is supported by Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 21YJC630072) and Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, China (No. G2020403008).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119919940"

Remarkably, hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric vehicles can outperform battery-powered electric vehicles largely in the sense of the driving range and the refueling time. However, both of them require a better coordination of infrastructure system and renewable energy resources to achieve a significant reduction of GHG emissions. This article aims to maximize the long-term profitability for the planning model of hydrogen refueling stations, where the capacitated flow refueling location model is leveraged for maximal traffic flow coverage. Furthermore, we discuss various real-world constraints, such as traffic network constraints, distribution network constraints, hydrogen balance constraints, and energy constraints for electric vehicles, to make the planning model more practical. By considering the uncertainty of the short-term refueling demand across the city, an approach for geographically redistributing hydrogen among the stations is also presented where the minimal cost of redistribution is modeled by one-commodity pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem.

This article investigates the prospects of implementing hydrogen P2G technology in coupling the power system and the transportation system. A novel coordinated long-term planning model of integrated power and transportation system (IPTS) at the regional scale is proposed to simulate the power system balance and travel demand balance simultaneously, while subject to a series of constraints, such as CO2 emission constraints. IPTS of Texas was investigated considering various CO2 emission cap scenarios. Results show unique decarbonization trajectories of the proposed coordinated planning model, in which IPTS prefers to decarbonizing the power sector firstly. When the power system reaches ultralow carbon intensity, the IPTS then focuses on the road transportation system decarbonization. The results show that with the P2G system, IPTS of Texas could achieve 100% CO2 emission reductions (relative 2018 emissions level) by adding a combination of approximately 143.5 GW of wind, 50 GW of solar PV, and 40 GW of P2G systems with 2.5% renewables curtailment.

Existing research on EV routing planning and charging navigation strategies mainly focuses on vehicle-road-network interactions, but the vehicle-to-vehicle interaction has rarely been considered, particularly in studying simultaneous charging requests. To investigate the interaction of multiple vehicles in routing planning and charging, a routing optimization of EVs for charging with an event-driven pricing strategy is proposed. The urban area of a city is taken as a case for numerical simulation, which demonstrates that the proposed strategy can not only alleviate the long-time queuing for EV fast charging but also improve the utilization rate of charging infrastructures. Note to Practitioners - This article was inspired by the concerns of difficulties for electric vehicle (EV)'s fast charging and the imbalance of the utilization rate of charging facilities. Existing route optimization and charging navigation research are mainly applicable to static traffic networks, which cannot dynamically adjust driving routes and charging strategies with real-time traffic information. Besides, the mutual impact between vehicles is rarely considered in these works in routing planning. To resolve the shortcomings of existing models, a receding-horizon-based strategy that can be applied to dynamic traffic networks is proposed. In this article, various factors that the user is concerned about within the course of driving are converted into driving costs, through which each road section of traffic networks is assigned the corresponding values. Combined with the graph theory analysis method, the mathematical form of the dynamic traffic network is presented. Then, the article carefully plans and adjusts EV driving routes and charging strategies. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly increase the adoption of EV fast charging while alleviating unreasonable distributions of regional charging demand. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Electric vehicle (EV); event-driven; navigation; receding-horizon; routing optimization","Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Fast charging (Batteries); Mobile telecommunication systems; Routing algorithms; Urban planning; Charging infrastructures; Driving characteristics; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Market penetration; Navigation strategies; Routing optimization; Utilization rates; Vehicle to vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51807127 and Grant 52111530067 and in part by the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant 2020YFSY0037.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113338410"

This increases uncertainty in power systems. On the other hand, reactive power plays a key role in voltage stability, so modeling reactive power planning in TEP is very important. The amount of reactive power is a determining factor regarding the stability of the network voltage and in case of shortage, occurrence of some events may endanger the voltage stability. This research aims at proposing a hybrid TEP and reactive power planning for the first time. Furthermore, the impact of wind, PV power plants, and EVs, as the common sources of uncertainties, are included. The ultimate goal of HTEP-RPP is to find the transmission line candidates that meet the reactive power requirements.

At the higher level, an optimization problem is formalized for the optimal planning of locations, sizes, and unit prices of a set of new charging stations in a territory, which embeds the UE conditions and the power flow model as constraints. The main novelties lie in the integration of traffic and electric networks, the optimization problem formalization, and the inclusion of detailed electrical issues [such as the complete alternating current (AC) power flow equations and the modeling of CSs with different phases].

Besides, in the context of parcel delivery deep growth related to e-commerce, electric vehicle is becoming an alternative to conventional fossil fuel technology. Intrinsically, the charging process implies the interdependence between the transportation and electric power systems. This paper presents a new multistage optimization-based approach that allows linking delivery routing and aggregated demand management in the transportation and electric power systems, respectively. For the routing and charging of each independent electric vehicle, battery degradation, acceleration- and speed-dependent power consumption, penalty for delivery delay, tolls, fixed charging prices and incentives for availability time are considered. An electric vehicle demand aggregator is used to guarantee the synergy between systems. Incentives are included to motivate electric vehicles to remain at charging intersections. However, attractive incentives can create electric power system congestion due to simultaneous charges on nodes. Thus, an iterative decongestion methodology is developed. The resulting model is divided into three stages: delivery allocation, delivery routing for each independent electric vehicle and optimal energy management by electric vehicle demand aggregator. The resulting optimization problem is cast as a mixed-integer linear programming model for the first two stages and a linear programming model for the third stage. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a real 284-intersection map with a set of 100 electric vehicles, showing that incentives allow electric vehicle demand aggregator to achieve cost savings of 8.5%. © 2021 The Author(s)","Electric vehicle demand aggregator; Incentives for availability time; Mixed-integer linear programming; Power system decongestion methodology; Routing problem","Availability; Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Iterative methods; Traffic congestion; Electric vehicle demand aggregator; Incentive for availability time; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear; Mixed-integer linear programming; Operational planning; Power; Power system decongestion methodology; Routing problems; Routings; Integer programming; detection method; electric vehicle; global warming; integrated approach; methodology; model","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain, under Projects RTI2018-096108-A-I00 and RTI2018-098703-B-I00 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE), and in part by the University of Castilla-La Mancha, under Grant 2021-GRIN-30952 .","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114183046"

A change such as this will be multifaceted. A power system production cost model (PCM) is a useful tool with which to analyze one of these facets, the operation of the power system. A PCM is a computer simulation that mimics power system operation, i.e., unit commitment, economic dispatch, reserves, etc. To understand how electric vehicles (EVs) will affect power system operation, it is necessary to create models that describe how EVs interact with power system operations that are suitable for use in a PCM. In this work, EV charging data from the EV Project, reported by the Idaho National Laboratory, were used to create scalable, statistical models of EV charging load profiles suitable for incorporation into a PCM. Models of EV loads were created for uncoordinated and coordinated charging. Uncoordinated charging load represents the load resulting from EV owners that charge at times of their choosing. To create an uncoordinated charging load profile, the parameters of importance are the number of vehicles, charger type, battery capacity, availability for charging, and battery beginning and ending states of charge. Coordinated charging is where EVs are charged via an “aggregator” that interacts with a power system operator to schedule EV charging at times that either minimize system operating costs, decrease EV charging costs, or both, while meeting the daily EV charging requirements subject to the EV owners’ charging constraints. Beta distributions were found to be the most appropriate distribution for statistically modeling the initial and final state of charge (SoC) of vehicles in an EV fleet. A Monte Carlo technique was implemented by sampling the charging parameters of importance to create an uncoordinated charging load time series. Coordinated charging was modeled as a controllable load within the PCM to represent the influence of the EV fleet on the system’s electricity price. The charging models were integrated as EV loads in a simple 5-bus system to demonstrate their usefulness. Polaris Systems Optimization’s PCM power system optimizer (PSO) was employed to show the effect of the EVs on one day of operation in the 5-bus power system, yielding interesting and valid results and showing the effectiveness of the charging models. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we aim at showing these uncertainties and assess different levers to enable the integration of e-Mobility. Therefore, we introduce an Agent-based model assessing regional charging demand and infrastructure networks with the interactions between charging infrastructure and electric vehicles. A global sensitivity analysis is applied to derive general guidelines for integrating e-Mobility effectively within a region by considering the grid impact, the economic viability and the Service Quality of the deployed Charging Infrastructure (SQCI). We show that an improved macro-economic framework should enable infrastructure investments across different types of locations such as public, highway and work to utilize cross-locational charging peak reduction effects. Since the height of the residential charging peak depends up to 18% on public charger availability, supporting public charging infrastructure investments especially in highly utilized power grid regions is recommended. © 2021 by the authors.","Agent-based modeling; Charging infrastructure assessment; E-Mobility integration; Global sensitivity analysis; Levers; Service quality","Autonomous agents; Charging (batteries); Computational methods; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Integration; Investments; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Simulation platform; Uncertainty analysis; Agent-based model; Charging demands; Charging infrastructure assessment; Charging infrastructures; E mobilities; E-mobility integration; Global sensitivity analysis; Infrastructure networks; Lever; Service Quality; Quality of service","Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Kopernikus Project ENSURE ‘New ENergy grid StructURes for the German Energiewende’ [grant number 03SFK1A0-2].","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121026480"

The planning of the distribution network in RAs needs to consider the orderly charging load of EVs. In the current study, an orderly charging planning method for the charging posts and distribution network of RAs was proposed. First, a charging load forecasting model based on the travel characteristics, charging time, and ownership of EVs in RAs was established. Then, a hierarchical orderly charging optimization method, including a distribution network layer and EV access node layer, was devised. The upper layer optimizes the distribution network. The objective function is the minimum variance of the overall load in the RA and the constraint conditions satisfy the overall charging load demand and the capacity of the distributed network. The lower layer optimizes the EV access nodes. The objective function is the minimum variance of the node access load, and the constraint conditions are to meet the regional charging load demand and the optimal power balance demand transmitted from the upper layer to the lower layer. A nonlinear optimization algorithm is employed to solve these objective functions. An IEEE 33 node example was used to obtain the orderly charging power load curves for weekdays and weekends in RAs, and the simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021 by the authors.

Recently, the process of designing solar charging stations as flexible sources has been growing and developing. This paper presents a relatively complete design of a solar charging station as a flexible economic resource in a 10-year planning horizon based on a genetic algorithm in two scenarios. PVCSs are not considered in the first scenario. This scenario is only to confirm the results, and the proposed method is proposed. However, in the second scenario, the effects of PVCSs and the demand response strategy (DR) on this development are considered. Copula probability distribution functions are used to create appropriate scenarios for vehicles during different planning years. The proposed energy management system shows a stable performance in terms of the annual load growth index and electricity price of each level of demand over the time horizon along with minimizing power losses and costs required, which makes PVCS efficiency higher and gives them a suitable structure and stability. The modeling results in terms of uncertainties in the system indicate that the use of load management along with PVCS design and flexible electric vehicle charge control strategies improves power quality parameters and optimizes system cost over a period of 10 years. Compared to the obtained results with the traditional case, it is observed that long-term planning in terms of DR and PVCSs and the technical specifications of the network have been improved. As a result of this proposed long-term planning, PVCSs are more flexible. © 2021 by the authors.

These factors include the increasing share of decentralized energy generation and storage systems in distribution networks, the integration of electric vehicles, the coupling of electrical and thermal systems, as well as the increasing and easy use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The primary actors in this situation, formerly known as consumers of energy and power, have now become prosumers (producers and consumers), who feed energy back into the network at specific times. Hybrid energy systems combine cross-sectoral energy sources and supply systems as well as energy distribution and storage to form one compact system. The aim is to substitute fossil energy sources with primarily renewably generated electricity, other renewable energy sources, and sustainable ways of energy usage. Moreover, the use of new meter functions and services enables market-dependent dynamic or special consumer- and prosumer-oriented tariffs. A simulation model has been developed to model, simulate, and analyze the behavior and steady-state energy flows of such hybrid energy systems. By using linear optimization algorithms, the optimal use of decentralized energy generation and storage systems is determined in the example of a single-family house.

These changes are driven by the increased penetration of distributed Low Carbon Technologies, both on the generation side (i.e. adoption of micro-renewables) and demand side (i.e. electric vehicle charging). The previously passive ‘fit-and-forget’ approach to LV network management is becoming increasing inefficient to ensure its effective operation. A more agile approach to operation and planning is needed, that includes pro-active prediction and mitigation of risks to local sub-networks (such as risk of voltage deviations out of legal limits). The mass rollout of smart meters (SMs) and advances in metering infrastructure holds the promise for smarter network management. However, many of the proposed methods require full observability, yet the expectation of being able to collect complete, error free data from every smart meter is unrealistic in operational reality. Furthermore, the smart meter (SM) roll-out has encountered significant issues, with the current voluntary nature of installation in the UK and in many other countries resulting in low-likelihood of full SM coverage for all LV networks. Even with a comprehensive SM roll-out privacy restrictions, constrain data availability from meters. To address these issues, this paper proposes the use of a Deep Learning Neural Network architecture to predict the voltage distribution with partial SM coverage on actual network operator LV circuits. The results show that SM measurements from key locations are sufficient for effective prediction of the voltage distribution, even without the use of the high granularity personal power demand data from individual customers. © 2021 The Author(s)","Analytic methods in power networks; Big Data Analytics; Deep neural learning; Distribution network operation; Privacy-preserving data analysis; Smart meters; Voltage prediction","Big data; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Network architecture; Privacy-preserving techniques; Smart meters; Smart power grids; Analytic method; Analytic method in power network; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Deep neural learning; Distribution network operation; Neural learning; Power networks; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving data analyse; Voltage prediction; Data Analytics","Funding text 1: This work was performed as part of the Network Constraints Early Warning System (NCEWS) project.

However, if EVCS are exclusively supplied by the grid, negative impacts on its stability together with possible CO<inf>2</inf> emission increases could be produced. Introduction of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) for EVCS can cope with both drawbacks by reducing the load on the grid and generating clean electricity. This paper develops a weighted multicriteria methodology to design the most suitable configuration of HRES for EVCS. This method determines the local renewable resources and the EVCS electricity demand. Then, taking into account environmental, economic and technical aspects, it deduces the most adequate HRES power generation planning for EVCS. Besides, an experimental stage to validate the design deduced from the multicriteria methodology is included. Therefore, the final power generation planning for the HRES in EVCS is supported not only by a complete numerical evaluation, but also by an experimental verification of the demand being fully covered. Methodology application to Valencia (Spain) proves that an off-grid HRES with solar PV, wind and batteries support would be the most suitable configuration for the system.

Furthermore, batteries and diesel generators can be also considered as possibilities to support the HRES, especially if the EVCS is intended to be off-grid [23].Fig. 9 shows the evaluation of each of the multicriteria parameters for each of the analyzed configurations. Regarding their environmental parameters (EmR and ReG), the configurations with renewable generation and batteries are by far the most influential. The configurations that include renewable generation, batteries and the support of diesel generators (ren + gen + bat) result also influential in environmental criteria for the options that use diesel generator during short periods. However, the power generation planning design options that use diesel generators for long time periods have the worst environmental impact. Alternatives including renewable generation with the support of the grid are the best economic options (EcF), and they also present good technical criteria (SS, ESA). However, configurations with renewable generation and diesel generators result are the worst choice in all the aspects: environmental, economic and technical.From the configuration ranking in Table 10 we can extract the three most suitable configuration options for the HRES in the Valencia case study. The highest-scored option is related to an off grid energy scenario that includes renewable generation (500 kW solar PV and 330 kW wind) and the support of a group of batteries (4800 kWh). The second alternative corresponds to another off grid scenario, similar to the first one, but with the support of a diesel generator (280 kW).

Recently, some studies found electric vehicles that receive fast-charging service may also bring much air pollution due to fossil-fuel fired power generation. Hence, depending on the power generation mix, electric vehicles may have adverse environmental impacts. The current studies of fast-charging station planning only focus on power system planning and often ignore other parts of the transportation system such as internal combustion engine vehicles and gasoline stations. Moreover, most the current studies lack a comprehensive planning strategy for the fast-charging station that involves elements above simultaneously. In this context, an interdisciplinary study is implemented on the coordinated planning strategy of the fast-charging station in coupled transportation and power distribution systems. The proposed strategy with a multiple objective integer model can measure the impact of air pollutions from electric vehicles on air quality and human health in different areas. Considering the traffic flow assignment, the driving range logic constraints are used. The branch flow model is applied to power distribution systems. To measure the impacts of air pollutions on air quality and human health, the air pollution from the Road traffic model, the Gaussian Plum Model and the C-R function are adopted. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the proposed strategy and the mathematical model. The fast-charging station location and size can be determined by the mathematical model. The transition of gasoline station to fast-charging station is suggested according to the model as well. © 2021","Fast-charging station; Gasoline station transition; Human health impact; Multi-objective coordinated planning","Air quality; Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Gasoline; Planning; 'current; Charging station planning; Fast charging stations; Gasoline station transition; Gasoline stations; Human health impacts; Multi-objective coordinated planning; Planning strategies; Power-distribution system; Transportation system; Health","This work is supported by the ARC Research Hub Grant IH180100020, the ARC Training Centre IC200100023, the ARC linkage project LP200100056, and Sir William Tyree Foundation-Distributed Power Generation Research Fund.

Considering the uncertain driving pattern of EVs, they are dynamic consumers of electricity and their integration can give rise to operational problems and jeopardize the security of the power system. Under such circumstances, the implementation of demand-side response (DSR) programs is more likely to be an effective solution for reducing the risks of load curtailment or security problems. This study proposes a voltage stability constrained DSR-coordinated planning model for increasing the penetration level of EVs in a distribution system consisting of photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs) and responsive loads. The uncertainties of PV/WT generation, the driving pattern of EVs, and load demand are modeled by an improved form of information gap decision theory (IGDT), hereafter called weighted IGDT (WIGDT). Due to the fact that the proposed model is nonlinear and non-convex, a linearization technique is adopted and the proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), solved using the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software.

This article proposes a distributed voltage regulation scheme for dominantly resistive distribution networks through coordinated EV charging/discharging. In the optimal planning stage, the maximal profit of each EV user for the regulation provision is guaranteed, while the driving need can be satisfied. An optimal charging model is proposed to plan the total available $P$ and $Q$ , and a parameter 'involvement level' is introduced for the fair pricing of participating EV users. In the regulation stage, an adaptive voltage sensitivity coefficient is developed to estimate the amount of required power for voltage regulation. A novel parallel consensus sharing strategy is designed so that the local power dispatch decision can be made by each EV through information sharing between neighboring buses. The backup support from the local energy storage system (ESS) can be activated under the emergency scenario due to communication failure and insufficient EV resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively and robustly regulate the voltage and is scalable to different network topologies. © 2015 IEEE.","Distributed voltage regulation; distribution network; electric vehicle (EV) fleets; optimal charging; vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Charging (batteries); Electric lines; Electric load dispatching; Energy storage; Voltage regulators; Bi-directional chargers; Communication failure; Distributed voltages; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Emergency scenario; Information sharing; Real and reactive power; Voltage regulation scheme; Electric power distribution","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China for the Research Project under Grant 51807171; in part by the Guangdong Science and Technology Department for the Research Project under Grant 2019A1515011226; in part by the Hong Kong Research Grant Council for the Research Projects under Grant 15200418 and Grant 15219619; and in part by the Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development for the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) Research Project under Grant P921.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103236198"

The proposed method is also aimed at keeping the comfort and satisfaction of the EV users at a high level without the obligation of the EV owners to inform the operator of the entry and charge planning. DBS introduces a real-time energy-sharing method that uses both the grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) topologies simultaneously without knowing the power demand profile in advance. However, from the perspective of smart grid, it is also possible to activate the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) topology in case of frequency or voltage fluctuations in the network with the proposed DBS. The proposed DBS was simulated in real time and phasor analysis for different penetration levels in MATLAB/Simulink program. Considering that EV driver behavior is highly variable and will vary regionally, it is shown that the proposed DBS gives dynamic results against all behavioral situations, varying penetration levels, and all the negativities that may occur in the penetration of EVs are overcome by keeping the satisfaction of EV drivers at a high levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Charging strategy; G2V; Smart grid; V2G; V2V","Electric network parameters; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; MATLAB; Topology; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Frequency deviation; Grid to vehicle (G2V); Infrastructure costs; Network integration; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle to vehicles; Voltage fluctuations; Vehicle-to-grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103054840"

Extensive electric vehicle demands at the peak-times, and an increase in electricity consumption due to population growth, have led to higher utility infrastructure investments. Mobile energy hubs i.e. clustered EVs parked in a dedicated location, can be used as an innovative demand-side management solution to reduce long-term utility infrastructure investments. They can store and release electricity to the grid based on consumer demand. However, a scientific planning approach for grid integration has been overlooked. Accordingly, this study proposes a comprehensive framework required to plan and develop mobile energy hubs based on optimization of life cycle cost, access distance and parking duration considering the temporal variation of EV recharging demands. The results of the study show that the framework developed can minimize lifecycle costs, and improve infrastructure utilization by accounting for the interests of all stakeholders. The total cost with the proposed robust optimization model under uncertainties of 50% is lesser than the robust cost calculated from a scenario-based approach.

Due to electric vehicle users' driving patterns and equipment's high costs, these stations must be concentrated in certain regions. This paper presents a methodology for assisting electricity distribution companies in identifying candidate connection points for fast charging stations to reduce new installations and network reinforcement investments. First, possible connection points are analyzed with graph theory to find the least costly connection; this strategy prioritizes the current network elements' unused capacity. As a second step, the electric distribution network is analyzed after fast-charging stations have been connected, evaluating the networks' operational limits.

However, the ever-larger share of intermittent renewable power plants, combined with the high and uncontrolled aggregate EV charging demand, requires an evolution toward new planning and management paradigms of energy districts. Thus, in this context, this paper proposes novel smart charging (SC) techniques that aim to integrate as much as possible RES generation and EV charging demand at the local level, synergically acting on power flows and avoiding detrimental effects on the electrical power system. To make this possible, a centralized charging management system (CMS) capable of individually modulating each charging power of plugged EVs is presented in this paper. The CMS aims to maximize the charging self-consumption from local RES, flattening the peak power required to the external grid. Moreover, the CMS guarantees an overall good state of charge (SOC) at departure time for all the vehicles without requiring additional energy from the grid even under low RES power availability conditions. Two methods that differ as a function of the EV power flow direction are proposed. The first SC only involves unidirectional power flow, while the second one also considers bidirectional power flow among vehicles, operating in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) mode. Finally, simulations, which are presented considering an actual case study, validate the SC effects on a reference scenario consisting of an industrial area having a photovoltaic (PV) plant, non-modulable electrical loads, and EV charging stations (CS). Results are collected and performance improvements by operating the different SC methods are compared and described in detail in this paper. © Copyright © 2021 Lo Franco, Mandrioli, Ricco, Monteiro, Monteiro, Afonso and Grandi.","charging management system (CMS); electric vehicles; parking lot charging station; photovoltaic (PV); renewable energy source (RES); smart charging; state of charge (SOC); vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)","Charging (batteries); Electric load flow; Electric vehicles; Natural resources; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Vehicle-to-grid; Zoning; Charging management system; Charging managements; Charging station; Management systems; Parking lot charging station; Parking lots; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy source; Smart charging; State of charge; States of charges; Vehicle to vehicles; Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V); Renewable energy resources","This work was supported by the project “Energy Networks Integration for Urban Systems (ENERGYNIUS)” funded by POR-FESR Region Emilia Romagna (Italy) 2014-2020.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119600609"

In this work, we illustrate how a car sharing fleet can be incorporated as a flexible load in the micro-grid management system. A linear optimization problem is formulated, where the cost function makes a trade-off between the gain in flexibility in the micro-grid and the loss incurred by the car-sharing service for delaying the recharging procedure of the EV.

The planning of a charging stations is a complicated problem involving roads and power grids. The Gradient-based optimizer (GBO) used for solving the charger placement problem is tested in this work. A good balance between exploitation and exploration is achieved by the GBO. Furthermore, the likelihood of becoming stuck in premature convergence and local optima is rare in a GBO.

Proper assessment of the costs and benefits involved in EV integration hinges on correctly modeling and evaluating EV-user driving and charging patterns. Recent studies have evidenced that EV users do not plug in their vehicle every day (here called non-systematic plug-in behavior), which can alter the impacts of EV charging and the flexibility that EV fleets can provide to the system. This work set out to evaluate the effect of considering non-systematic plug-in behavior in EV grid integration studies. To do so, an open-access agent-based EV simulation model that includes a probabilistic plug-in decision module was developed and calibrated to match the charging behavior observed in the Electric Nation project, a large-scale smart charging trial. Analysis shows that users tend to plug-in their EV between 2 and 3 times per week, with a lower plug-in frequency for large-battery EVs and large heterogeneity in user charging preferences. Results computed using our model show that non-systematic plug-in behavior effects reduce the impact of EV charging, especially for price-responsive charging, as fewer EVs charge simultaneously. On the other hand, non-systematic plug-in can reduce available flexibility, particularly when considering current trends towards larger battery sizes. Counter-intuitively, large-battery fleets can have reduced flexibility compared to small-battery fleets, both in power and stored energy, due to lower plug-in frequency and higher energy requirements per charging session. Improving plug-in ratios of EV users appears as key enabler for flexibility. In comparison, augmenting charging power can increase the flexibility provided by EV fleets but at the expense of larger impacts on distribution grids. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Charging choices; Electric vehicles; Electricity distribution systems; Smart charging; Vehicle-to-grid","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Plug-in electric vehicles; Secondary batteries; Charging choice; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity distribution systems; Grid integration; Large-scales; Plug-ins; Smart charging; Vehicle fleets; Vehicle to grids; Vehicle users; Vehicle-to-grid","This research is supported by the Chair “Hybrid Technologies and Electromobility Economy”, called the Armand Peugeot Chair, led by CentraleSupélec and the ESSEC and sponsored by Stellantis, and funded by the ANRT under ‘CIFRE’ contract n° 2018/0031 .","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118488790"

In this study, we address the challenges of the grid connection in combination with an increasing number of electric vehicles (EV) in the future. The here developed model is applied for an innovative building block in Germany with a photovoltaic (PV) system, a combined heat and power (CHP) unit, battery storage and electric vehicles. The results of the simulation are validated with real-life data to illustrate the practical relevance and show that our simulation model is able to support the planning of decentralised energy systems. We demonstrate that without anticipating future electric vehicle charging, the system configurations could be sub-optimal if complete self-sufficiency is the objective: in our case study, the rate of self-sufficiency of the net-zero energy building will be lowered from 100% to 91% if considering electric vehicles. Furthermore, our simulation shows that a peak minimising operation strategy with a battery can prevent grid overloads caused by EV charging in the future. Simulating different battery operation strategies can further help to implement the most useful strategy, without interruption of the current operation. © 2021 by the authors.

In this sense, the availability of electric models of batteries and supercapacitors is necessary for the correct sizing, control, and energy management of power systems. In order to identify the parameters of the equivalent electric model, the identification current profile is often a pulse of charge or discharge. Subsequently, these models are validated with a current verification profile. However, the verification profile compared to the identification profile is more dynamic in amplitude and frequency, producing validation errors due to the identification signal's limited bandwidth. This paper proposes a novel Pulse - Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (Pulse - PRBS) identification current profile, with similar spectral characteristics to the verification profile, in order to improve the modeling accuracy. The parameters of a Lithium-ion battery and a supercapacitor are obtained with this new identification current profile and the Optimization Toolbox of Matlab, using the electrical models in Simulink or Simscape. Finally, the models are validated with the Urban Driving Cycle ECE-15 and the Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) for electric vehicle applications. © 2021 IEEE.","Equivalent circuit model; Frequency spectrum; Lithium-ion battery; Parameter identification; Pseudo-random binary sequence; Supercapacitor","Automotive batteries; Binary sequences; Electric discharges; Electric power system control; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Parameter estimation; Supercapacitor; Electrical models; Optimization toolbox; Pseudo-random binary sequences; Spectral characteristics; Super-capacitor modeling; Urban driving cycles; Validation errors; Vehicle applications; Lithium-ion batteries","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115155608"

The proposed signal increases the utilization EV chargers. Also, the planning approach jointly considers the PV allocation to provide more energy and power capacity for chargers and to reduce overall energy cost. This proposed approach considers coordinated charging /discharging, creating bidirectional power flow between the grid and the EVs. The planning problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program to maximize the net annual revenue. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation technique is utilized to account for the uncertainties associated with the PV generation and the power demand.

Energy storage systems are considered effective tools to deal with the surge of charging demands brought by EV/GV and enhance energy supply reliability. Meanwhile, the coupling between power and gas distribution systems has been strengthened in recent years via gas turbines. This makes it possible and imperative to jointly optimize the configuration of electrical and gas storage systems and avoid the overinvestment commonly occurring in separate planning. To this end, this paper proposes a joint electrical and gas energy storage planning approach considering the interdependency between power-gas distribution network and transportation network. First, the semi-dynamic traffic assignment method is utilized to obtain EV/GV traffic flow and its transition between two adjacent periods. EV/GV traffic flow is directly related to EV/GV charging demands and can be further converted into their spatial–temporal distribution. Second, a novel second-order cone formulation is proposed to accurately describe the nonlinear operating characteristic of gas storage system. This can help to incorporate the constraints associated with the effective operation of gas storage systems into the planning model, while ensuring the computational tractability. Finally, the proposed planning problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming problem. A penalty convex-concave procedure algorithm is developed to ensure the exactness of all second-order cone relaxations in our proposed model.

Flexible loads are the key in the concept of demand response and, if well-planned, can save significant costs and emissions through optimal use of energy resources. On the other hand, fast charge electric vehicles, despite their appeal, represent a special type of loads demanding an immediate attendance upon admission to charging stations. This may counterbalance the efforts toward flexible load management. Moreover, there is a rising demand for fast-charge stations with a more balanced spatial distribution. In this paper, a comprehensive multi-stage residential load planning scheme is proposed incorporating the most diverse load groups in a realistic market environment. Within this procedure, a unique concept is implemented which taps into the aggregated residential load flexibility to support fast charge of electric vehicles. Through cluster-wise scheduling for different load classes, the proposed approach aggregates the flexibility of a heterogeneous population of different multi-apartment loads including air conditioning and water heating devices as well as slow-charging EVs to also plan for fast-charge-powered EVs. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the successful implementation of the proposed framework within urban neighborhoods which proves efficient in reducing fast-charge load on the grid besides financial benefits for aggregators. © 2021","Air conditioning; Demand response; Electric vehicles; Fast charge; FL2V concept; Load clustering; Water heating systems","Aggregates; Air conditioning; Energy resources; Housing; Charging station; Demand response; Energy; Fast charges; FL2V concept; Flexible loads; Load clustering; Power distribution network; Residential loads; Water heating systems; Electric vehicles; air conditioning; demand-side management; electric vehicle; electricity supply; neighborhood; urban area","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110471340"

The main idea is to optimize the EVCS configuration by considering Voltage Profile Improvement Index (VPII), Reactive Power Loss Reduction Index (QLRI), Real Power Loss Reduction Index (PLRI), and the preliminary development cost to get the minimum value of the installation cost and to provide higher quality of parameters for the power grid. For solving the studied nonlinear mixed-integer optimization problem, a new improved metaheuristic, called Balanced Mayfly Algorithm (BMA) is proposed. The modification is established to improve the accuracy and to resolve the exploration issue of the algorithm. The BMA used two modifications including elite mayfly couples and chaos mechanism to resolve these issues as it is possible. After validating the algorithm, it is applied to 30-bus distribution system in Allahabad, India and its results are compared with GAIPSO and basic MA. The results indicated that the voltage shape is smoothened and a reasonable balance between voltage profile and network losses is obtained. The results also show that the suggested method with 18.358 MW active power loss, 73.826 MVar reactive power loss, 10961 s computational burden, and 415 number of charging ports gives superior performance with lesser power losses.

In today's power system, these conditions are mostly reasoned through the uncertain performance of a number of parameters e.g. price, so the use of uncertainty modeling becomes necessary. In the present work, an optimization model, based on virus search colony, is used for the optimal performance of intelligent parking of electric vehicles in uncertainty situations caused by the price of the upstream grid in the demand response (DRP) program. It has been used to reduce the daily cost of performance by changing various parts of the load between peak and off-peak intervals. Virus Colony Search (VCS) method is a method based on the random-based population, which is also based on specific behaviors of the virus. Chaos theory has been used to develop this algorithm and improve local and global search. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective algorithm is a model based on non-dominated sorting model, variable detection, memory-based strategy selection and fuzzy theory to select the best Pareto from the answer set. Besides, it has a powerful function in solving the above problem. Regarding the mentioned techniques, the possibility of being in local points is reduced and the speed of convergence to the final response is increased. The proposed method was investigated on a sample system including, intelligent parking, local units, thermal and renewable plants in the proposed upstream grid price uncertainty technique. The obtained results show the efficiency of the suggested model. According to the compared results, under the demand response program, the average value of the smart parking cost is reduced about 4%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand Side Management; Smart Parking; Uncertainty Modeling; Virus Colony Search Optimization Method","Cost reduction; Demand side management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Hydrogen storage; Uncertainty analysis; Demand response programs; Model-based OPC; Optimal design; Performance; Search optimization method; Smart parking; Uncertainty; Uncertainty models; Vehicle parking; Virus colony search optimization method; Viruses","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122761626"

The total objective function is defined as minimizing the total cost including the cost of grid power, cost of power losses, cost of charge and discharge of parking lots, cost of wind turbines as well as voltage deviations reduction. In the OSPF, optimization variables are selected as electric parking size and wind turbines, which have been determined optimally using an intelligent method named arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) inspired by arithmetic operators in mathematics. The load following strategy (LFS) is used for energy management in the OSPF. The OSPF is evaluated in three cases of the objective function such as minimizing the cost of power losses, minimizing the network voltage deviations, and minimizing the total objective function using the AOA. The capability of the AOA is compared with the well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms for solving the OSPF in the last case. The findings show that the power loss, voltage deviations, and power purchased from the grid are reduced considerably based on the OSPF using the AOA. The results show the lowest total cost of energy and also minimum network voltage deviation (third case) by the AOA in comparison with the PSO and ABC with a higher convergence rate, which confirms the better capability of the proposed method. The results of the first and second cases show the high cost of power purchased from the main grid as well as the high total cost. Therefore, the comparison of different cases confirms that considering the cost index along with losses and voltage deviations causes a compromise between different objectives, and thus the cost of purchasing power from the main network is significantly reduced. Moreover, the voltage profile of the network improves, and also the minimum voltage of the network is also enhanced using the OSPF via the AOA. © 2021 by the authors.

Eventually this ubiquitous fleet of minibus taxis is expected to transition to electric vehicles, which will result in an additional energy burden on Africa's already fragile electrical grids. This paper examines the electrical energy demands of this possible evolution, and presents a generic simulation environment to assess the grid impact and charging opportunities. We used GPS tracking and spatio-temporal data to assess the energy requirements of nine electric minibus taxis as well as the informal and formal stops at which the taxis can recharge. Given the region's abundant sunshine, we modelled a grid-connected solar photovoltaic charging system to determine how effectively PV may be used to offset the additional burden on the electrical grid. The mean energy demand of the taxis was 213kWh/d, resulting in an average efficiency of 0.93kWh/km. The stopping time across taxis, a proxy for charging opportunity, ranged from 7.7 h/d to 10.6 h/d. The energy supplied per surface area of PV to offset the charging load of a taxi while stopping, ranged from 0.38 to 0.90kWh/m2 per day. Our simulator, which is publicly available, and the results will allow traffic planners and grid operators to assess and plan for looming electric vehicle roll-outs. © 2021 The Authors","Demand management; Electric vehicle; Minibus taxi; Paratransit; Renewable energy","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Taxicabs; Average efficiencies; Electrical energy demand; Energy requirements; Generic simulation; Operational characteristics; Solar photovoltaics; Spatio-temporal data; Sub-saharan africa; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; bus transport; developing world; disability; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy resource; GPS; mobility; taxi transport; transportation planning; travel demand; urban transport; South Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa","The authords acknowledge MiX Telematics for the data, and MTN South Africa (through the MTN Mobile Intelligence Lab), and Eskom (through the Tertiary Education Support Programme) for sponsoring this research.

In this sense, this work proposes a methodology to define the optimal location of EV semi-fast charging stations (CS) at a neighborhood level, through a multi-objective approach. It applies a hierarchical clustering method to define CS service zones, considering both technical and mobility aspects. Besides, it considers uncertainties related to the EV load profile to determine the CS capacity, based on the user's charging behavior. A Pareto Frontier method is deployed to support the decision-making process on CS optimal location, considering utility and EV users’ preferences. The results indicate that the best CS locations for mid-term EV penetration can also fit into long-term planning, with higher EV charging demand. Thus, these locations would be good candidates for the power utility to make initial investments, regarding both planning horizons. A real distribution system case is used to demonstrate the applicability of the results. © 2021","Charging station; Distribution system; Electric vehicles; Hierarchical clustering; Multi-objective optimization","Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Cluster analysis; Decision making; Economics; Investments; Location; Multiobjective optimization; Charging station; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical Clustering; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Neighbourhood; Objective approaches; Optimal locations; Electric vehicles","This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa no estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) and INERGE.

ANNs are trained with a very large database in any climatic conditions and for a flexible power system configuration and varying electrical loads. They directly predict the yearly CEC energy performance without performing any system dynamic simulations using sophisticated models of each CEC component. Only eight dimensionless input parameters are required, such as the fractions of wind and battery power installed, yearly mean and standard deviation values of the total horizontal solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature and load. The Garson algorithm was applied for the evaluation of each input influence on each output.

The intention of this work is to make a comparison between a metaheuristic optimization technique and two fuzzy logic controllers, and with that highlight the advantages of using fuzzy logic and validate it to the detriment of other metaheuristic techniques. The optimization technique used was simulated annealing, in order to minimize the total energy cost of the system being studied. Tree charging strategies were adopted: peak charging, off-peak charging, and smart charging besides demand-side management techniques. In addition to the charging process will also be studied the battery electric vehicles discharging, preferably at the peak of the load curve, through the creation of a charging/discharging station. In this work, the system used is the IEEE-39 bus New England power system. Two fuzzy logic controllers have been developed, namely the charging station controller and the vehicle-to-grid controller. Together they decide the proper energy flow between the EVs and the grid. Energy discharge to the grid from EVs or energy required for charging EVs is controlled and tested for the real-time scenario.

Thus, this research is directed to the solution, using heuristic algorithms, since they allow the non-convex constraints of the proposed mathematical problem. The optimization algorithm proposed for the analysis is given by the Multi-Object Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) method, which provides a set of solutions that are known as Optimal Pareto.

Furthermore, seeking to understand whether optimizing and allocating PHEV charging loads can effectively decrease investments and operational costs of the power system with high wind penetration, we also evaluate the potential cost savings from the dedicated governmental charging strategy of PHEV fleets. To this end, we develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model for optimal power system investment decisions.

The objectives of the planning model are to minimise the total cost of investment and energy losses of the distribution system while maximising the total captured traffic flow. The uncertainties associated with wind power sources are considered. Additionally, the uncertainties in EV daily charging loads are also important concerns in the optimisation of the planning model. To model the EV load uncertainties, a recent scenario generation (SG) method is adopted. Further, a multi-objective optimisation tool, Multi-Objective Natural Aggregation Algorithm (MONAA), is introduced to obtain the final solutions of the planning model.

With proper evaluation, distribution system operators can decide on a reasonable course of action for encouraging energy flexibility and make predictions on the recommended timing and magnitude of system updates under different scenarios. However, there is no efficient tool for system operators to quickly set up and perform simulations of alternative scenarios for system updates before planning their course of action, without much experience with programming or system modeling. This paper proposes an agent-based modeling framework for developing agent-based simulation models of business ecosystems that can be applied to multiple evaluation scenarios by simple configuration of agents and roles. There are two steps in this proposed framework: Step 1 – Interface and role interactions design and Step 2 – Agent architecture and connections design. In addition, the framework depends on a pre-step that covers mapping and architecture development of the business ecosystem to be modeled. The framework is demonstrated with a case study of an energy business ecosystem consisting of an electricity distribution grid with 137 connected domestic consumers. The case study shows that the proposed agent-based modeling framework supports the development of agent-based models for simulating energy business ecosystems. To verify the behavior of the developed agent-based simulation models, a verification procedure of the agent models is briefly discussed, which includes unit, integration, and system testing approaches similar to the ones used in software testing. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agent-based modeling; Model framework; Smart grid","Autonomous agents; Charging (batteries); Computational methods; Ecosystems; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Integration testing; Smart power grids; Verification; Agent based modeling frameworks; Agent-based framework; Agent-based model; Agent-based simulation models; Business ecosystem; Case-studies; Course of action; Energy business; Modelling framework; System operator; Simulation platform","This work is conducted as part of the national electricity digitalization transition project, Flexible Energy Denmark (FED) which is funded by Innovation Fund Denmark.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115610760"

The hybridization of energy sources and energy storage units enables improving the sustainability, reliability, and robustness of power systems. To reach the objective of zero emissions, a proton exchange membrane hydrogen fuel‐cell was utilized as an energy source. The aim of this research was to create an accurate optimal sizing procedure for determining the nominal rating of the necessary sources. We modeled the fuel cell and the battery pack using data from real experimental results to create the generic database. Then, we added data on the mission profile, system constraints, and the minimization target function. The mission profile was then analyzed by the sizing algorithm to determine optional minimum and maximum fuel cell ratings. Analyzing the optional solutions using the vehicle real time energy management system controller resulted in a set of solutions for each available rated fuel cell, and the optimal compatible battery in the revealed band successfully accomplished the route of the driving cycle within the system limitations. Finally, the Pareto curve represented the optimal finding of the sizing procedure. Ultimately, in contrast to previous works that utilize gross manufacturer data in the sizing procedure, the main research contribution and novelty of this research is the very accurate sizing results, which draw on real experimental‐based fuel‐cell and battery sizing models. Moreover, the actual vehicle real time energy management system controllers were used in the sizing procedure. © 2021 by the authors.

With different operational constraints, a multi-objective optimization using real power loss and voltage deviation index is formulated and solved using the Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA).The paper highlights the computational efficiency of COA with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), in addition to various literary works, and the results suggest the superiority of COA by its global optima. The required battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity for supplying an islanded network's entire load demand for a day is determined in the second stage.

By exploiting Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) such as solar energy (PV) and wind energy (WT) as widely acknowledged RESs to be more environmentally friendly and address power difficulties. They are acknowledged to be an interesting option to charge Electric Vehicles (EVs) via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. On the contrary, to the best knowledge of the authors, there are few numbers published articles on RESs (PV and WT) integrated with Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) to charge EVs. This research is aimed at implementing a metaheuristic optimization algorithm named Antlion Optimizer (ALO) algorithm for sizing the system components to meet the load demand and minimize the two objective functions - Losses Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and Cost of Electricity (COE) while maximizing the Renewable Energy Fraction (REF). In addition, the Rule-Based Energy Management Strategy (RB-EMS) is proposed to control the flow of power in the system. The integration of RESs to the utility grid with V2G technology and V2G services is discussed. Furthermore, the State-of-the-art for improving the stability and reliability of the grid-connected system is presented. As a result, the attained result from the proposed method shows better performance results as 0.0936 $/kWh, 0.1044%, and 0.9940% for COE, LPSP, and REF, respectively.

Optimal planning avails itself of the exploitation manner of existing energy resources alongside appropriate employment of demand response (DR) programs and available electric vehicles (EV) in parking lots of immense industrial centers as storage sites in energy management systems in industrial smart grids have been seriously considered. This article introduces a new perspective in the simultaneous use of demand response loads and available electric vehicles in parking lots toward energy management of industrial virtual power plants (IVPPs) aiming at augmenting the system's profits as well as increasing the grid reliability under peak load conditions and cutting down on industrial centers load shedding. The objective function of the problem is formulated within the framework of short-term production planning for distributed energy resources (DER) and conventional ones in conjunction with DR programs and EV in such a way that the IVPPs' profits are maximized. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we have applied and tried on the second zone of IEEE-RTS standard grid. The outcomes accrued from various simulations point to the fact that the presence of EV within the boundaries of EV's parking lots prompts considerable increase in IVPPs' storage amount and consequent decline in exploiting full power grid capacity. Utilizing DR programs for responding load and selecting best scheduling schemes for each IVPP during various times of a day-night cycles will bring about a reduction in operation costs, de-peaking as well as an enhanced performance of EV's parking installations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response (DR) Program; Electric vehicles (EV); Industrial virtual power plant (IVPP); Mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP); Stochastic energy management","Electric load shedding; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management systems; Industrial plants; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Planning; Production control; Profitability; Smart power grids; Demand response programs; Electric vehicle; Energy; Industrial virtual power plant; Management systems; Mixed integer non-linear programming; Parking lots; Smart grid; Stochastic energy management; Virtual power plants; Energy management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111211160"

We identify six adoption scenarios that combine deployment levels of rooftop solar photovoltaic modules (PV), electric vehicle charging (EV), and battery storage in residential and commercial customers connected to representative feeders in Indiana by 2025 and 2040. Indiana is a good proxy for many U.S. states with low current DER adoption but potentially high future growth. The economic value of DER is assessed by developing capacity expansion and power flow analysis of the generation and distribution segments, respectively, under future hourly demand assumptions based on each adoption scenarios. Results for the distribution system power flow simulations show that voltage violations are relatively rare. Voltage violations can be mitigated at a very low cost using a combination of smart inverters in future rooftop PV systems and voltage adjustments in the feeder heads. Line loading issues are minimal, with only 0.2% of simulation hours showing loading levels above 100% of capacity. Generation capacity impacts are driven by unmanaged EV charging and could be mitigated with charging management. We estimate that the incremental rate impact from power system investment and operation of increased DER adoption in Indiana will be between −1.6% to + 2% in 2025 and + 0.2% to + 15% in 2040 relative to the base case. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cost benefit analysis; Distributed energy resources; Power system; Rooftop solar","Charging (batteries); Commercial vehicles; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Electric vehicles; Expansion; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Cost-benefits analysis; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric vehicle charging; Indiana; Power; Power system; Rooftop solar; Solar electric vehicles; Utility distribution system; Voltage violation; Energy resources; detection method; economic conditions; electric vehicle; energy storage; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; simulation; solar power; United States","Funding text 1: We would like to acknowledge helpful feedback provided by the staff at the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission: Brad Borum, Bob Morgan, and Dale Thomas.

With the rising demand for EVs and fast-charging stations (FCSs), the installation of renewable-based distributed generators (DGs) can further defer network upgrades and minimize energy losses. In this article, a new planning model is proposed to site and size FCSs and wind-based DGs, taking into account the stochastic nature of FCSs, residential EV loads, and renewable generation. The proposed planning model considers different cost and revenue components associated with FCSs and wind-based DGs. A typical distribution network is overlaid on a geographic map to illustrate how the network is connected with the municipal layout, thus taking into account practical constraints for installing FCSs and DGs in the vicinity of each bus. A novel scoring scheme that considers practical geographical aspects is developed to quantify the attractiveness of FCS candidate locations to the drivers of EVs. This scheme is essential to ensure installing FCSs at locations that maximize revenue to investors. Results demonstrate that planning for both FCSs and wind-based DGs is effective from a financial standpoint. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This state-of-the-art model represents a scientific contribution as it integrates a European power-system model with a complete sectoral representation of the energy system technologies and infrastructure that account for all greenhouse gas emissions considered in the targets, and takes into consideration a detailed description of the cross-sectoral flexibility (e.g. flexible heat and power cogeneration, demand shedding from power-to-X and electrified industrial processes, short- and long-term storage of diverse energy carriers, smart charging and vehicle-to-grid for electric vehicles, and passive storage of ambience heat for the built environment). This model provides a detailed description of the operation of technologies and considers exogenous technological learning to simultaneously solve multi-year planning of investments, retrofitting, and economical decommissioning with intra-year operational, flexible, and despatch decisions. The model is applied to a case study of the Netherlands energy transition under the current climate policy and conservative projections for the economy and availability of resources. The results present a significant reliance on renewable energy sources, such as wind (800 PJ) and solar (300 PJ), to fuel the electrification revolution as well as biomass (550 PJ) for feedstock and heat purposes coupled with carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) to achieve negative emissions in certain sectors. However, oil (880 PJ) and gas (1050 PJ) constitute almost half of the final energy demand as they are required for heat applications, industrial feedstock, refined oil products for export, and international transport fuel. Four different sensitivity analyses are presented for the emission reduction target, oil demand streams, biomass availability, and demand volumes. The most significant findings are as follows: 1) it is crucial to have simultaneous highly available biomass and CCUS storage capacities to achieve negative emissions and facilitate the transition; 2) even in a highly decarbonised scenario, it is necessary to simultaneously develop climate policies focused on international transport emissions, oil-based feedstock, and refined-oil product exports to completely displace oil from the energy mix; 3) (imported) biomass has the ability to decrease system costs (3% under conservative scenarios of availability and price); however, for biomass prices higher than 20 €/GJ, this effect is lower; 4) in relative terms, the system is most sensitive to demand uncertainties from the transport sector than any other sector, followed closely by the industrial sector. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bottom up technological representation of sectors and technologies; Cross-sectoral flexibility; High variable renewable energy scenarios; Integrated energy system model; Netherlands energy transition","","Funding text 1: We wish to acknowledge the support provided by the Energy Systems Transition Center's Integrated Energy System Analysis project, financed by the New Energy Coalition (finance code: 656039).

However, a good power curve model is difficult to obtain because of the uncertain relationship between wind speed and its power output. Existing works focus on a deterministic model or use probabilistic distribution to represent such uncertain relation, which is not easy to be employed by the following decision-makers. This paper presents a novel concept termed as quantile power curve, which generates a series of power curves under any confidence level. Quantile loss based neural network algorithm is proposed to establish the quantile power curve. Index to measure the wind turbine performance and power generation uncertainty is also proposed based on the quantile power curve. Based on the operational data of a Chinese wind farm, the proposed model and index are validated and employed to estimate the wind energy yield when planning a system with wind, solar and electric vehicle charging loads. The results show that quantile power curve provides more comprehensive information about the uncertainty during the power generation process and helps to improve the renewable supply rate to charging loads. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Neural network; Performance evaluation; Quantile loss function; Quantile power curve; Wind turbine power curve","Decision making; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Neural networks; Probability distributions; Wind; Wind power; Curve modeling; Neural-networks; Performances evaluation; Power curves; Quantile loss function; Quantile power curve; Turbine performance; Wind farm; Wind turbine power; Wind turbine power curve; Wind turbines; algorithm; alternative energy; decision making; electric vehicle; energy planning; power generation; probability; wind farm; wind turbine; wind velocity; Indicator indicator","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFE0109000 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51707063 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107053302"

With the development of the modeling method, a number of methods based on probabilistic models are applied to generate scenarios. Model-based methods are often difficult to scale or sample. Data-driven technologies use a large number of data to mine the mapping relationships, instead of explicitly specifying a model. In this paper, we proposed a data-driven approach to generate scenarios using generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn the distribution of the charging current of EVs and obtain more abundant scenarios. The proposed method is applied to time-series data from the charging current dataset of EVs. Firstly, the K-Means clustering algorithm is used to preprocess the data to divide the distribution of charging current into four areas. Then, aiming to improve the training speed, GANs with gradient penalty (GP) is used for the generation of EV scenarios, which can use the GP term to optimize the Lipschitz limit. Finally, statistical methods are applied to estimate the quality of the generated data. Results show that the proposed method can effectively extend the historical data for the operation and planning of EVs in the future compared with the traditional GANs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","electric vehicle; generative adversarial networks (GANs); K-Means; scenario generation","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Adversarial networks; Data-driven approach; Electric vehicle charging; Mapping relationships; Model-based method; Number of methods; Probabilistic models; Scenario generation; K-means clustering","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51977128) and Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (19020500800).; Funding text 2: National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 51977128; Shanghai Science and Technology Committee, Grant/Award Number: 19020500800 Funding information S","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107035366"

This paper proposes a two-level optimization algorithm for the energy management of residential appliances within a smart home, including interruptible, uninterruptible, thermostatically controlled, and non-schedulable loads, as well as the charging/discharging strategies of electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in the presence of distributed energy resources (DERs). In the first level of optimization, to minimize the cost of electricity, the operating time of smart home components is determined by SHEMS, and active power is exchanged between equipment. At this level, the impact of demand response (DR) constraints on the cost and load factor (LF) of the smart home have also been investigated. In the second level, considering the optimal cost obtained in the first level, in addition to the active power, the reactive power required by loads is also provided by using the additional capacity of EV and ESS inverters and improves the power factor (PF) of the house at the connection point to the grid. Day-ahead electricity costs are calculated depending on different pricing signals (TOU, RTP) with the power exchange capacity (buying/ selling) with the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is examined on a typical smart home over a 24-h. By reviewing the numerical results obtained for the cost and the LF in different scenarios, and observing the increase of the PF of home from 0.65 to 0.94 and also examining the performance of the equipment during the planning time, the efficiency of the model is proved. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Electric vehicles; Load factor; Optimization; Power factor; Smart home energy management system; Thermostatically controlled loads","Automation; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power factor; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Housing; Optimization; Active power; Demand response; Energy; Load factors; Optimisations; Power factors; Smart home energy management systems; Smart homes; Storage systems; Thermostatically controlled loads; Intelligent buildings; algorithm; electric vehicle; optimization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105358111"

Resulting issues are expected to be mitigated by charging control. In particular, voltage-based charging control, by relying only on the local measurements of voltage at the point of connection, provides an autonomous communication-free solution. The controller, attached to the charging equipment, compares the measured voltage to a reference voltage and adapts the charging power using a droop control characteristic. We present a systematic study of the voltage-based droop control method for electric vehicles to establish the usability of the method for all the currently available residential electric vehicle charging possibilities considering a wide range of electric vehicle penetra-tions. Voltage limits are evaluated according to the international standard EN50160, using long-term load flow simulations based on a real distribution grid topology and real load profiles. The results achieved show that the voltage-based droop controller is able to mitigate the under voltage problems completely in distribution grids in cases either deploying low charging power levels or exhibiting low penetration rates. For high charging rates and high penetrations, the control mechanism improves the overall voltage profile, but it does not remedy the under voltage problems completely. The evaluation also shows the controller’s ability to reduce the peak power at the transformer and indicates the impact it has on users due to the reduction in the average charging rates. The outcomes of the paper provide the distribution grid operators an insight on the voltage-based droop control mechanism for the future grid planning and investments. © 2021 by the authors.

The MG considered in this work is well equipped with smart grid infrastructure and embedded with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Moreover, it is a green and fossil fuel free MG without any conventional power plant. The MG provides its load demand by solely renewable generations, including wind farms (WF) and photovoltaic (PV) power plants. Therefore, keeping balance between generation and demand is a difficult task in day-ahead operation planning of this MG. In order to overcome this obstacle, the MG uses a mega-scale battery energy storage system (BESS). However, the capacity of the BESS is limited and it is not economically feasible to increase the BESS capacity. Therefore, the MG considers PEVs G2V/V2G operation modes planning and dump loads optimal utilization as supplementary balance options. The main dump loads in this MG are industrial fish refrigerators (IFRs) and reverse osmosis desalination system (RODS). These dump loads in addition to PEVs’ G2V/V2G modes of operation are scheduled in the EMS proposed in this paper.

Output power of this technology, similar to other types of RES, suffers from intermittency, while it is still more predictable in comparison to other technologies of RESs. Besides, energy storage systems (ESS) are introduced as a pivotal technology for dealing with the intermittent and non-dispatchable characteristics of IHS through spatio-temporal arbitrage.

This paper simulates the main last mile distribution models that can be adopted in a mega-city such as Madrid. In particular, the impact of carrying out the full load of the last mile distribution by means of electric vehicles is analyzed. Two fundamental aspects are studied, the efficiency of the different routes developed by each transport vehicle and the impact that these routes have in the electrical distribution network. For this purpose, an intelligent route planner, capable of optimizing the distribution of the load among the number of vehicles available in each postal service hub (PSH), is combined with a Reference Network Model that designs and expands the distribution network to supply consumers and electric vehicles. Several scenarios in terms of location and segmentation of postal service hubs are analyzed. From this analysis, it is concluded that reinforcements on the distribution network are avoided if the operation is decentralized (using fourteen PSHs), since a centralized operation (a single PSH) would require longer routes with higher energy consumption. Moreover, decentralized operation would enhance the emissions reduction achieved by electrifying the fleet, since the estimated absolute emissions of the electrified fleet for a decentralized scenario are up to 50% lower compared to a centralized one. Finally, the results reveal that smart charging strategies also contribute to lessen the incremental costs in the distribution network, in addition to significantly reducing the cost of energy supply. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle charging; Last mile distribution; Power distribution networks; Vehicle routing problem","Electric automobiles; Electric network parameters; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Freight transportation; Postal services; Transportation routes; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Centralized operations; Distribution models; Electrical distribution networks; Emissions reduction; Number of vehicles; Transport vehicles; Urban distribution; Vehicle technology; Electric load distribution","Funding text 1: This work has been economically supported by an Aristos Campus Mundus Research Grant in 2019.

Previous research always focuses on single optimization process on shared vehicle planning, rather than the combination of demand management into day-ahead planning operations. To this end, we attempt to propose a mixed integer programming model integrating demand response operations to further explore the impacts of demand response on shared electric vehicle planning operations. We first model a two-stages model integrating charging facility location in the first stage and vehicle relocation in the second stage. Moreover, both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties are considered and approximated into tractable form by applying sample average approximation and distributional robust set featuring the entropy knowledge and electric vehicle's multi-level charging duration. The demand response policy is also proposed to reshape the original charging demand into an economical and reliable way to improve operational efficiency and mitigate the power overload issues caused by massive electric vehicle adoption. Further, we conduct a real-world case study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to explore the social-operational impacts of vehicle planning optimization model integrating the demand response, robust charging facility planning in three areas: (1) The demand response integration promote electric vehicle planning operations on cost-saving for about 3%. (2) Data richness of serviceability towards charging piles influence all decisions through the shared electric vehicle charging station planning.

Using classical optimization to define the most suitable reinforcements is the most desirable alternative. However, the extent of the under‐study problems is growing, because of the uncertainties introduced by renewable generation or electric vehicles (EVs) and the larger sizes under consideration given the trends for higher renewable shares and stronger market integration. This means that classical optimization, even using efficient techniques, such as stochastic decomposition, can have issues when solving large‐sized problems. This is compounded by the fact that, in many cases, it is necessary to solve a large number of instances of a problem in order to incorporate further considerations. Thus, it can be interesting to resort to metaheuristics, which can offer quick solutions at the expense of an optimality guarantee. Metaheuristics can even be combined with classical optimization to try to extract the best of both worlds. There is a vast literature that tests individual metaheuristics on specific case studies, but wide comparisons are missing. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA), orthogonal crossover based differential evolution (OXDE), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), moth–flame optimization (MFO), exchange market algorithm (EMA), sine cosine algorithm (SCA) optimization and imperialistic competitive algorithm (ICA) are tested and compared. The algorithms are applied to the standard test systems of IEEE 24, and 118 buses. Results indicate that, although all metaheuristics are effective, they have diverging profiles in terms of computational time and finding optimal plans for TEP. © 2021 by the authors.","Electrical vehicles (EVs); Optimization algorithms; Transmission expansion planning (TEP); Uncertainty; Wind farms","Commerce; Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission; Expansion; Heuristic algorithms; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Classical optimization; Differential Evolution; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Imperialistic competitive algorithms; Power system planning; Sine-cosine algorithm; Stochastic decomposition; Transmission expansion planning; Genetic algorithms","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125952825"

However, the high penetration rate of EVs has brought great challenges to the operation of the Active Distribution Network (ADN). On the other hand, EVs will be equipped with more intelligent chargers in the future, which supports the EVs’ high flexibility in both active and reactive power control. In this paper, a distributed optimization model of ADN is proposed by employing the collaborative active and reactive power control capability of EVs. Firstly, the preference of EV users is taken into account and the charging mode of EVs is divided into three categories: rated power charging, non‐discharging, and flexible charging–discharging. Then, the reactive power compensation capacity of the plugged‐in EV is deduced based on the circuit topology of the intelligent charger and the active–reactive power control model of the EV is established subsequently. Secondly, considering the operation constraints of ADN and the charging–discharging constraints of EVs over the operation planning horizon, the optimization objective of the model is proposed, which consists of two parts: “minimizing energy cost” and “improving voltage profile”. Finally, a distributed solution method is proposed based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The proposed model is implemented on a 33‐bus ADN. The obtained results demonstrate that it is beneficial to achieve lower energy cost and increase the voltage profile of the ADN. In addition, the energy demand of EV batteries in their plugin intervals is met, and the demand preference of EV users is guaranteed. © 2021 by the authors.","Active Distribution Network; ADMM; Collaborative active and reactive power; Demand preference; Electric vehicles","electric vehicle; emission control; energy conservation; government; optimization","Funding: This work is supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, grant number 2019QN123.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108179900"

This power system comprises two isolated systems: Lanzarote-Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria. The generating, storage and transmission capacity to be built is determined by solving a two-stage stochastic investment model taking into account different long-term uncertain parameters: investment costs of immature technologies of power production and storage, annual demand growth, number of electric vehicles, rooftop solar penetration and natural gas prices. The possibility of linking together the isolated power systems of Lanzarote-Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria for reaching a higher penetration of renewable units is also considered. The operation of the power system is simulated by considering the day-ahead energy and reserve capacity markets. The variability of the hourly available wind and solar power, and the demand level are modeled by using a set of characteristic days to represent the target year. The performance of the resulting power system is assessed by conducting an out-of-sample analysis using the AC model of the power system.

Within the synchronous area of continental Europe, flexible generators and loads can provide Frequency Containment Reserve and Frequency Restoration Reserve marketed through the balancing markets. The Transmission System Operators use these flexibilities to maintain or restore the grid frequency when there are deviations. This paper shows the future flexibility potential of Germany’s household sector, in particular for single-family and twin homes in 2025 and 2030 with the assumption that households primarily optimize their self-consumption. The primary focus is directed to the flexibility potential of Electric Vehicles, Heat Pumps, Photovoltaics and Battery Storage Systems. A total of 10 different household system configurations were considered and combined in a weighted average based on the scenario framework of the German Grid Development Plan. The household generation, consumption and storage units were simulated in a mixed-integer linear programming model to create the time series for the self-consumption optimized households. This solved the unit commitment problem for each of the decentralized households in their individual configurations. Finally, the individual household flexibilities were evaluated and then aggregated to a Germany-wide flexibility profile for single-family and twin homes. The results indicate that the household sector can contribute significantly to system stabilization with an average potential of 30 GW negative and 3 GW positive flexibility in 2025. In 2030, the corresponding flexibilities potentially increase to 90 GW and 30 GW, respectively. This underlines that considerable flexibility reserves could be provided by single-family and twin homes in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

The successful deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) in the transportation sector depends on fast charging station, charging process, autonomy, and EVs on-road price. This paper focuses on the installation of a fast charging station, a case study of IEEE 24-bus test system. The paper presents siting of charging stations with different power ratings of 5, 25, 50, and 100 MW onto the load bus lines in a different test case system keeping in mind the violation of voltage magnitude limit (0.95 < V < 1.05) and line ratings. Four different test cases have been analyzed using Newton–Raphson (NR) method for the integration of charging stations.The random charging of EVs results in power fluctuations at the grid side, power quality issues, and equipment loss of life. Distributed generators (DGs) are an effective way to improve the quality of energy services.

In this regard, with the emergence of competitive markets, drawing upon responsive programs and electric vehicles in planning smart networks has become an intense topic of research. This paper presents a new method for programming industrial virtual power plants (IVPP) considering synchronous presence of demand response programs and electric vehicles. The proposed algorithm aims at maximizing the proceeds from industrial networks through demand response planning and managing the energy consumption of electrical vehicles. The algorithm is implemented in Zone 2 of the modified version of the IEEE Reliability Test System. The simulation results show that the presence of electric vehicles in the parked position will increase the storage capacity of the IVPPs, whereupon the consumption load on IVPPs is reduced. Using demand response programs in this regard and selecting the best program for each IVPP at different times of the day cuts back on both network operating costs and high consumption peaks, whereby an improvement in the efficiency of electric vehicles parking schemes is obtained. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response programs; Electric vehicles; Industrial virtual power plant; Mixed integer non-linear programming; Stochastic energy management","Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Operating costs; Demand response; Demand response programs; Electricity-consumption; Energy; Industrial grids; Industrial virtual power plant; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Power; Stochastic energy management; Virtual power plants; Energy management; algorithm; demand-side management; electric vehicle; optimization; power plant; smart grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102481064"

The objective of the model is to minimize the sum of the construction cost, operation and maintenance costs, travel cost to charging stations, and the cost of power loss for charging stations at established bus terminus. The Affinity Propagation method is adopted to cluster the bus terminuses in order to obtain a preliminary number of charging stations. Subsequently, the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to optimize the site selection and capacity.

With technological advances in the realm of communications and development in the infrastructure, a proper environment for the active contribution of customers has been formed. This new structure has enabled the consumers to play a vital role in the market via Demand Response Programs (DRPs) and coordinated aggregated Plug-In Electric Vehicle (PEV) fleets. These new resources could be a merit for the power system provided that they are employed correctly and in coordination with the rest of the system. The SCUC is where DRPs and PEVs could be optimally addressed to exploit their full potential. This paper tackles the problem of SCUC in the presence of DRPs and aggregated PEV fleets. The objective is to lessen the operation cost provided that all constraints are satisfied. Different constraints including those related to the system, units, transmission system, DRPs, and PEVs as well as the security constraints are taken into consideration. The SCUC is modeled as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem and an appropriate model of PEVs is derived to facilitate the integration of these resources into the grid while considering their charging and discharging characteristics as well as efficiency. Moreover, a suitable model of DRPs is introduced in this study based on the concept of price elasticity of demand. The proposed approach is practiced over the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System (RTS) to analyze the effect of the smart grid on SCUC. Obtained results demonstrate that with proper deployment of DRPs and PEVs the operation cost could be lessened while the security of the system is improved. © 2020","Demand Response Programs; Electric vehicles; Smart grid; Stochastic SCUC","Economic analysis; Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission; Integer programming; Operating costs; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Demand response programs; Discharging characteristics; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Power system operators; Price-elasticity of demand; Reliability test system; Security-constrained unit commitment; Stochastic mixed integer programming; Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099224654"

The possibility of charging individual electric vehicles at employer's premises enables the use of an electric vehicle for a large part of the population. In addition, solar radiation peaks during common working hours, resulting in economic and ecological advantages of locally installed photovoltaic systems at the workplace. As business-as-usual charging management is based on rudimentary rules, this power is not optimally used. Furthermore, high charging utilization may lead to high loads and thereby exceed the limitations of the respective building's grid connection capacity. Hence, an optimization approach for improved charging management is required. A non-linear optimization model for coordinated charging of electric vehicles within a local energy system, which consists of a building, a photovoltaic system and a variety of different electric vehicles, is developed in this work. Respective charging profiles take the maximum charging power as a function of the state of charge into account. The objective is to minimize the costs of the charging station operator, incorporating customer satisfaction via penalty costs. The optimization model results in increased consumption of locally provided photovoltaic power and lower electricity costs in most cases. For companies with limited grid connection, the implementation also allows for more vehicles to be charged simultaneously without extending the grid connection capacity. The developed charging management is therefore suitable for real-time charging scheduling. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic charging management; Electric vehicle; Non-linear optimization; Photovoltaic; Real-time charging scheduling; Workplace charging","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Climate change; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Fleet operations; Photovoltaic cells; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging managements; Dynamic charging management; Grid connections; Management IS; Non-linear optimization; Optimization models; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Real-time charging scheduling; Workplace charging; Scheduling; cost analysis; electric vehicle; energy management; energy planning; model; model test; optimization; photovoltaic system; policy implementation; solar radiation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102021974"

Electric vehicle travelers choose the lowest-cost routes in response to the price of electricity and traffic conditions, which in turn affects the operation of the power and transportation networks. In particular, discrete choice models are utilized to describe the behavioral process of electric vehicle drivers. A game theoretic approach is employed to describe the competing behavior between the drivers and power generation units. The power-traffic network equilibrium is proved to possess a potential type structure, which establishes the properties of the network equilibrium. Moreover, the network equilibrium state is shown to be a welfare-maximizing operating point of the electric distribution network considering the spatial demand response of electric vehicle loads. A decentralized algorithm based on the optimality condition decomposition technique is developed to attain the equilibrium flow solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate how the proposed framework can be used to alleviate both power and traffic congestion. © 2021","Charging station; Discrete choice model; Electric vehicle; Optimal power flow; Wardrop equilibrium","Electric loads; Electric vehicles; Game theory; Motor transportation; Transportation routes; Decentralized algorithms; Decomposition technique; Discrete choice models; Game-theoretic perspectives; Numerical experiments; Optimality conditions; Power generation units; Transportation network; Traffic congestion; algorithm; decomposition analysis; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy planning; power generation; transportation development","This work was supported in part by Beijing Natural Science Foundation, China under Grant No. JQ18008 and in part by Shenzhen Science and Technology Program, China under Grant No. KQTD20170810150821146.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101688282"

These challenges are further amplified in the case of a highly urbanised and densely populated small island state, like Singapore, with limited space and options for electricity sector planning. In response, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of a large-scale EV deployment on the electricity sector from a whole-system perspective with focus on investments in the power sector for EV adoption, assuming minimum deployment of advanced “smart-grid” and “vehicle-to-grid” technologies. Findings suggest that a small-scale deployment of EVs below 20% replacement can be economically manageable. A large-scale of deployment of EVs would inevitably bring a notable impact to the electricity sector regardless the state of advanced technology development. From the perspective of integrated planning, cities, especially those with high vehicle density, should continue to exercise caution with EV deployment. A large-scale deployment should be pursued after a “stress-test” of the power system infrastructure from both the technical and economic perspectives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Charging demand; Electric vehicle; Electricity sector planning; Power infrastructure investment; Urban transport environment","Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Investments; Advanced technology development; Economic perspective; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity sector; Integrated planning; Large-scale deployment; System infrastructure; Vehicle charging; Smart power grids","Funding text 1: Lei Wang would like to thank the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 51875058 ); Chongqing Basic Science and Frontier Technology Research Special Project (NO.

A bilateral contract between EV aggregators and renewable distributed generators (DGs) is first used to maximize revenues for these market participants by optimally controlling EV charging/discharging. The developed market-based EV control model is then implemented in a distribution system and evaluated for its potential adverse effects on the system operation. An optimal capacitor sizing and placement method is proposed to resolve the negative impacts of such control model. The proposed capacitor optimization method along with the developed EV control model provides an EV-RES coordination framework that simultaneously addresses both market and operational objectives. A real distribution network is used to test the EV-RES coordination method and evaluate its performance for different loading conditions using three-phase unbalanced load flow calculations. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in not only providing cost savings for the system operation, but also in reducing the losses and voltage deviations that would be otherwise incurred due to uncoordinated EV scheduling.

In this study, a series of technical solutions, including the integration of plug-in vehicles (under multi-directional energy interaction paradigms), the Vehicles-to-Buildings interaction levels, and the grid-responsive control, were proposed, studied, and discussed to promote the resilient and smart energy systems from district levels in subtropical regions. Dynamic battery cycling aging and advanced modelling tool in this study outperforms traditional rough battery cycling aging approaches, and correct conclusions on battery and vehicle-to-building interaction, to avoid the battery performance overestimation. Novel energy management strategies advance traditional power flow strategy, in terms of the off-peak grid electricity shifting, the enhancement of renewable penetration, and the deceleration of battery cycling aging. Techno-economic performances have been investigated, including net present value (NPV), the discounted payback time (DPT), and the net direct energy consumption (DEC). Furthermore, the energy paradigm transition from negative to positive building–vehicle systems outperforms single case study in academia for carbon-neural transition. The research results showed that, with the energy paradigm transition from the negative to the positive system, the net present value increases from −7.182 × 107 to 5.164 × 108 HK$, and the average annual net DEC decreased from 249.1 to −343.3 kWh/m2.a. Furthermore, compared to Control Strategy 2 (grid-responsive control strategy), the proposed Control Strategy 3 (battery-protective control strategy) can improve the net present value, and the increasing magnitude is dependent on the specific energy paradigm. Furthermore, compared to the positive buildings-vehicle system, the impact of the vehicle-to-building interaction on the decreasing magnitude of the net present value is more prominent for the negative system. The uncertainty and sensitivity analyses indicate that the net present value of the positive energy paradigm as compared to the negative energy paradigm is more sensitive to the battery cost. This study demonstrates the techno-economic performance of district building–vehicle systems with the energy paradigm transition from the negative to the positive, together with a series of effective solutions.

The system under test consists of three coils with circular sector shape overlapped to minimize the mutual cross-coupling, a three-phase inverter at primary side and a three-phase rectifier at receiver side. In fact thanks to the delta configuration used to connect the coils of the electromagnetic structure, a three-phase Silicon Carbide (SiC) inverter is driving the transmitter side. The resonance tank capacitors are placed outside of the delta configuration reducing in this way their voltage sizing. This WPT system is used as a 100 kW–85 kHz ultrafast battery charger for light delivery vehicle directly supplied by the power grid of tramways. The adopted test-bench for the WPT charger consists of adding circulating boost converter to the system under test to perform the opposition method technique. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed structure together with the validation of fully exploited simulation analysis. This is demonstrated by transferring 100 kW with more than 94% DC-to-DC efficiency over 50 mm air gap in aligned conditions.

In addition, use of integrated cyber‐secure, resilient, cost‐efficient, and advanced communication technologies and solutions will be of key importance. This paper describes a potential three‐stage evolution path toward fully flexible, resilient, and digitalized electricity distribution networks. A special focus of this paper is the evolution and development of adaptive control and management methods as well as compat-ible collaborative market schemes that can enable the improved provision of flexibility services by distribution network‐connected flexible energy resources for local (distribution system operator) and system‐wide (transmission system operator) needs. © 2021 by the authors.

Models that mimic technology diffusion processes over time are fundamental to support decisions in power system planning and policymaking. This paper shows that spatiotemporal technology diffusion forecasts consist typically of three main modules: 1) a global technology diffusion forecast, 2) the cellular module that is a spatial data substrate with cell states and transition rules, and 3) a spatial mapping module, commonly based on Geographic Information Systems. This work provides a review of previous spatiotemporal DER diffusion models and details their common building blocks. Analyzing 16 model variants of an exemplary spatial simulation model used to predict electric vehicle adoption patterns in Portugal, the analysis suggests that model performance is strongly affected by careful tuning of spatial and temporal granularities and chosen inference techniques. In general, model validation remains challenging, as early diffusion stages have typically few observations for model calibration. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Energy systems; geographic information systems; power system planning; spatiotemporal simulation; technology diffusion","Electric power system planning; Energy resources; Forecasting; Distributed energy resource; Electricity-consumption; Inference techniques; New energy technologies; Power system planning; Spatial and temporal granularities; Spatial and temporal patterns; Technology diffusion; Diffusion","Manuscript received April 10, 2020; revised July 18, 2020; accepted August 26, 2020.

We demonstrate through a case study of UK residential charging that existing approaches may overestimate the increase in peak distribution network demand by 50%, which has implications for assessing the cost of network investments required.

In this paper, a planning framework is proposed to amplify the total benefit for the owners of FCSs and SWTs as well as local distribution companies (LDCs). A stochastic program is developed to site and size SWTs along with FCSs in urban and suburban areas considering their specific wind characteristics, statutory regulations, turbine clustering studies, and geographic constraints. A worthiness metric is also proposed to rank FCS candidate locations based on their attractiveness to electric-vehicle (EV) drivers. An electric distribution network is overlaid onto a geographic map of downtown Chicago to assess the introduced planning framework. Results show that new efficient SWTs in urban areas can realistically justify their own investments over the long-term, and reduce the overall system losses and support FCS loads.

Moreover, integrating hydrogen energy storage (HES) along with new flexible technologies, such as power to gas (P2G) system and demand response program (DRP) is proven to reduce total operation cost by facilitating renewable energy dispatch and shifting peak load demand to off-peak hours.

Electric Vehicles (EV) are an environmentally friendly alternative to reduce the reliance on fossil fuel and pollution. For public acceptance of EVs, functionality and accessibility of charging stations is of paramount importance. Improper planning of EV charging stations, however, is a threat to the power grid stability. EV charging stations must be placed in the transport network in such a way that the safe limit of distribution network parameters is not violated. Thus, charging station placement problem is an intricate problem involving convolution of transport and distribution networks. A novel and simple approach of formulating the charging station placement problem is presented in this work. This approach takes into account integrated cost of charging station placement as well as penalties for violating grid constraints. For obtaining an optimal solution of this placement problem, two efficient evolutionary algorithms, such as Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO) and Teaching Learning Based Optimization algorithm (TLBO) are amalgamated together thereby extracting the best features of the both algorithms. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is tested by solving selected standard benchmark problems as well as charging station placement problem.

In the region of urban, the growing penetration of electric vehicles and the corresponding fast charging techniques not only emerge an effective interface for the virtual power plant, but also emerge the vulnerable points for the cyber attack. Facing the complexity of the physical vehicle-grid system and the uncertainty of the communication network, the unified modelling with a cyber-physical operator is established in this work. By the implicit Runge-Kutta method, the cyber-physical dynamics of the vehicle-grid electrical system is narrowed in the finite-dimensional space, which mimics the latency and denial-of-service attacks with a discretized matrix. After that, the techniques of space transformation and the subspace mapping are introduced to further approximate the hybrid system by a reduced cyber-physical operator. The resulting operator simultaneously preserves the system structure and reduces the dimensions, which provides the opportunity for the extraction of dynamic indexes and the participation factor. The proposed cyber-physical operator has experimentally verified in the case studies as well as the disclosure of the multimodal vibration. It is found that the interface of open cyber network and the lower-inertia batteries inside the electric vehicles might become the potential attacking points for the integrated local energy system. By the malicious cyber attacks, the stability feature of the cyber-physical system could be reshaped to a multimodal shape, which injects inharmonious energy from the cyber network into the physical system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cyber-physical operator; Electric vehicle; Electrical grid; Multimodal vibration; Participation factor","Crime; Denial-of-service attack; Electric power plants; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Fast charging (Batteries); Hybrid systems; Network security; Runge Kutta methods; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Vibrations (mechanical); Charging techniques; Finite dimensional space; Implicit Runge-Kutta method; Local energy systems; Participation factors; Space transformations; Virtual power plants; Wireless communications; Cyber Physical System; communication network; computer system; electric vehicle; energy planning; operations technology; physical analysis; power plant; vibration","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1766210, 5162570).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099820816"

In particular, a considerable share of this flexibility may be dispatched to secure post-fault transient frequency dynamics. Pursuant to the unprecedented changes to the traditional portfolio of generation sources, this work presents a detailed analysis of the potential system-level value of unlocking flexibility from nuclear electricity production. A rigorous enhanced mixed integer linear programming (MILP) unit commitment formulation is adopted to simulate several generation-demand scenarios where different layers of flexibility are associated to the operation of nuclear power plants. Moreover, the proposed optimisation model is able to assess the benefit of the large contribution to the system inertial response provided by nuclear power plants. This is made possible by considering a set of linearised inertia-dependent and multi-speed constraints on post fault frequency dynamics.

Scattered renewable sources do not have a certain amount of production and, according to research, follow possible mathematical functions. Renewable energy sources are modeled on wind and solar production, both of which are moderately generated per hour. In this study, using, the optimal allocation problem of the electric vehicles parking lots and the optimal operation scheduling of the electric vehicles in a smart distribution network are studied as a novel optimization problem. In the proposed problem, the different factors including the technical and the economic issues are considered for achieving a realistic solution. In terms of technical issues, minimizing network losses, and minimizing voltage drop in feeders, as well as supplying all network demand are considered. Also, the total cost of the charging and discharge at the electric vehicles parking lots, and the total cost paid for purchasing power from upstream network are given as economic issues in the proposed problem. Moreover, the price-based DRP is considered due to the implementation of the demand side management program. To obtain the optimal solution, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithms (HMA) has been used.

To lessen the operational risk of existing distribution networks due to massive deployment of EVs, optimal planning and operation are vital as EVs elevate new charging demand. This article conducts a comprehensive study on the feasibility of integrating EVs into the existing distribution system, considering both slow and fast charging schemes. The problem is formulated as an objective function that minimizes the total price of charging incurred by the charging stations and the peak-to-average ratio. To diminish the negative impact of EVs on the node voltage in the distribution system, EVs are also modeled as a reactive power compensating device. Simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and an in-depth study is presented on the maximum feasible EV penetration to the existing system without augmentation. The problem is solved using a novel metaheuristic optimization called the water cycle algorithm. The proposed charging/discharging strategy works well and results in the housing of higher penetration of EVs in the distribution network along with a reduction in the charging price. Moreover, with the proposed coordinated strategy, the node voltage variation is found within the permissible limits. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Electric vehicles (EVs); grid-to-vehicle (G2V); reactive power compensation; vehicle-to-grid (V2G); water cycle algorithm (WCA)","Optimization; Urban transportation; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging/discharging; Compensating devices; Coordinated strategies; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Ev charging stations; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Peak to average ratios; Transportation sector; Fast charging (Batteries)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100717270"

This paper presents a grid-connected solar-wind hybrid system to supply the electrical load demand of a small shopping complex located in a university campus in India. Further., an EV charging station is incorporated in the system. Economic analysis is performed for the proposed setup to satisfy the charging demand of EVs as well as the electrical load demand of the shopping complex. The proposed system is designed by considering the cost of the purchased energy, which is sold to the utility grid, while the power exchange is ensured between the utility grid and other components of the system. The sizing of the component is performed to obtain the least levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) while minimizing the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) by using recent optimization techniques. The results demonstrate that the LCOE and LPSP for the proposed system are measured at 0.038 /kWh and 0.19% with a renewable fraction of 0.87, respectively. It is determined that a cost-effective and reliable system can be designed by the proper management of renewable power generation and load demands.

This study makes an early attempt to design an EV charging network where battery swap and supercharging are jointly coordinated. The swap and supercharge processes are characterized by Erlang B and Erlang C priority queues, respectively. A strategic location-allocation model is formulated to optimize the station sites, battery stock level, and the number of superchargers at chosen sites. Three design criteria, namely, battery state-of-charge, maximum service time, and power grid constraint, are simultaneously taken into account. Meta-heuristics algorithms incorporating Tabu search are developed to tackle the proposed non-linear mixed integer optimization model. Computational results on randomly generated instances show that the priority battery service scheme outperforms the pure battery swap station in terms of spare battery investment cost and charging flexibility. The case study on a real-world traffic network comprised of 0.714 million households further shows the efficacy and advantage of the dual battery charging process for ensuring state-of-charge, service time commitment, and network-wide grid stability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Battery swap; Erlang queue; Heuristic optimization; Location-allocation model; Power grid reliability; Supercharger","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Integer programming; Tabu search; Battery state of charge; Battery swap stations; Computational results; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Mixed integer optimization; Network planning; Strategic locations; Traffic networks; Secondary batteries","Funding text 1: This research is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) under Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) program (grant # 1704933).; Funding text 2: This research is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) under Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) program (grant # 1704933) .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098567026"

The search for solutions addressing climate change has led to several changes in the functioning of electrical systems, particularly concerning the increasing integration of renewable electricity production. However, in recent years, changes in the load side of the electrical system have also emerged. In particular, electric mobility has been developing, and a high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected in near future. This consumption is supplied by the distribution system but will impact the transmission network. Naturally, the amount of energy used by EVs is subject to uncertainties, which makes the problem complex. Those uncertainties cannot be easily modeled using statistical distributions because of the reduced history of available information. The transmission system operator (TSO) needs an efficient tool to analyze the adequacy of the transmission network to supply the distribution networks with high penetration of EVs. In this paper, a methodology based on symmetric/constrained fuzzy power flow is proposed to find the optimal investment policy at the transmission level while satisfying the technical constraints. The concept of dual variables provided by Lagrange multipliers, the natural result of the nonlinear optimization problem, is used to obtain the most promising reinforcement options considering the actual structure of the transmission network.

To overcome this research gap, this article integrates the interests of traffic networks into PDS and FCS joint planning model to mitigate negative impacts on traffic conditions caused by installing FCSs. First, a novel microscopic method that is different from traditional assignment methods is proposed to simulate the influences of FCSs on traffic flows and EV charging loads. Then, a multiobjective joint planning model is developed to minimize both the planning costs and unbalanced traffic flows. A new bilayer Benders decomposition algorithm is designed to solve the proposed joint planning model.

Because the use of EVs allows the prompted minimization of fossil fuel consumption, this modern mode of transport is regarded as environmentally friendly. Nevertheless, despite the benefits they afford, EVs cannot be extensively adopted worldwide because of the insufficiency of charging station infrastructures. Accordingly, there have been several attempts to establish EV charging stations supplied by a fossil fuel-powered main grid with electricity. However, these types of charging infrastructures can negatively impact the distribution system and environment; it can therefore result in peak load increment. A potential and efficient solution is the utilization of self-sustainable sources (such as photovoltaic (PV) energy), which can mitigate the adverse effects of fossil fuels. With this solution, the planning of the distribution system should be appropriate to satisfy the load demand because a large number of EVs will be connected to the grid. Because of the increasing importance of this subject, in this manuscript, PV-EV stand-alone connection and PV-EV-Grid in hybrid connection of charging system topologies and their associated control architectures are critically enumerated, presented, and discussed; several perspectives and problems that confront the EV charging technology are also highlighted. Furthermore, the impact of numerous EVs connected to the electricity grid is reviewed, and the analysis of various EV charging scheduling techniques and control topologies proposed in available literature is presented.

As majority of the energy is derived from fossil fuel based sources, they have created adverse effects on the environment. Efforts to safeguard the environment have led to the development of hybrid electric vehicles. Proliferation of EV in the markets depends on factors like price, battery technology, economy and development of fast charging stations. Fast charging stations are an important factor in EV market penetration. This paper focusses in designing fast charging solar hybrid EV charging station. To decrease dependence on the grid power and to increase profitability, the charging station includes a 100 kW solar power plant with storage. The paper presents a comprehensive model of the hybrid solar charging station. To determine the load on the station, a stochastic model is used to predict the arrival time, the SOC and the charging demand. Stochastic firefly algorithm (SFA) is used for MPPT control to obtain maximum power from the solar power plant and to ensure fast charging of the station batteries. The station is designed to supply power from the batteries during off-peak hours and from the grid during high peak hours. The paper also presents a multi-objective planning using SFA to minimize the investment cost and to increase the profit of the charging station. Results show that using SFA enables fast charging of the batteries and also increases the profit of the charging station. Higher profit will encourage utilities to invest in charging station and hence this will help in higher penetration of EVs in the market. © 2020 THE AUTHORS","Electric vehicles; Fast charging station; Firefly algorithm; MPPT; Photovoltaic system","Bioluminescence; Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Fast charging (Batteries); Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Hybrid vehicles; Investments; Optimization; Population statistics; Profitability; Secondary batteries; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Battery technology; Comprehensive model; Ev charging stations; Fast charging stations; Firefly algorithms; Market penetration; Multi-objective planning; Population growth; Solar power plants","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091712485"

The deployment of battery storage in the power grid, however, is currently limited by its low economic viability, which results from not only high capital costs but also the lack of flexible and efficient utilization schemes and business models. Making utility-scale battery storage portable through trucking unlocks its capability to provide various on-demand services. We introduce the potential applications of utility-scale portable energy storage and investigate its economics in California using a spatiotemporal decision model that determines the optimal operation and transportation schedules of portable storage.

Therefore, the intermittency in the power system transmits to the gas system through the gas-fired power plants, which makes the operation of these systems even more interdependent. This study proposes a novel possibilistic model for the integrated operation of gas and power systems in the presence of electric vehicles and demand response. The model takes into account uncertainty in demand prediction and output power of wind farms, which is based on possibility and necessity theories in fuzzy logic through modeling uncertain parameters by Gaussian membership function. Moreover, a contingency analysis algorithm based on maximin optimization is developed to enhance the resiliency in the integrated operation of these systems by finding the worst-case scenario for the outage of components. The proposed model is implemented on a Belgium gas network and IEEE 24-bus electricity network. It is demonstrated that the possibilistic model allows the gas network to respond to the demand variations by providing a sufficient level of linepack within the pipelines. As a result, gas-fired power plants are supposed to commit more efficiently to cope with the intermittency of wind farms, which reduce the wind curtailment by 26%. Furthermore, it is quantified that through applying the contingency analysis algorithm in presence of demand response and electrical vehicles, the costs of operation and load shedding is reduced up to 17% and 83%, respectively. © 2020","Demand response; Electrical vehicles; Gas and power systems; Possibilistic chance-constrained programming; Resiliency analysis; Scheduling","Computer programming; Electric network parameters; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Fuzzy logic; Gases; Membership functions; Power plants; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Chance-constrained programming; Contingency analysis; Electricity networks; Flexible characteristics; Gas-fired power plants; Gaussian membership function; Integrated Operations; Uncertainty in demand; Electric load shedding; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy planning; fuzzy mathematics; gas production; optimization; probability; Belgium","The authors gratefully acknowledge the EPSRC-funded programs \u201CUK Carbon Capture and Storage (UKCCSRC)\u201D under grant number EP/K000446/1 as well as the \u201CIntegrated Development of Low-Carbon Energy Systems (IDLES)\u201D under award number EP/R045518/1.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099515053"

To make adequate, holistic planning decisions over multiple years, the assessment of alternatives—such as reinforcements or the adoption of EV management strategies—must not only capture when the investments are needed but also the effects on customers and carbon emissions, all while accounting for uncertainties. This paper proposes a stochastic, practical, and scalable progressive multi-year planning methodology that considers technical, customer, economic and environmental aspects to make holistic planning decisions for existing LV networks to accommodate EVs. The proposed rule-based methodology contrasts the net present value and benefits of four planning alternatives: network reinforcements, EV charging point management, and their combinations. Uncertainties are catered for by adopting a Monte Carlo approach. Using two real UK LV networks and realistic time-series data, results demonstrate the importance of a holistic decision-making approach. From an economic perspective, EV management is better for voltage issues, and reinforcements for thermal problems. However, when customer effects are considered, the management can lead to unacceptable charging delays. Combinations, on the other hand, provide trade-offs between cost and the effects on customers or carbon emissions. © 2020 The Authors.

As the world is increasingly urbanized, it is crucial to identify cost-effective pathways to decarbonize and enhance the resilience of cities, which ensure the well-being of their dwellers. Here, we propose a 'SolarEV City' concept, in which integrated systems of cities' roof-top photovoltaics and electric vehicles (EVs) supply affordable and dispatchable CO2-free electricity to urban dwellers. Our analyses indicate that implementations of the concept can meet 53%-95% of electricity demands in nine major Japanese urban areas by 2030. CO2 emission from vehicle use and electricity generation in these areas can be reduced by 54%-95% with potential cost savings of 26%-41%. High cost-effectiveness and seasonally stable insolation in low latitudes may imply that the concept may be more effective to decarbonize urban environments in emerging economies in low latitudes. Among several factors, governmental interventions will play a crucial role in realizing such systems, particularly in legislating regulations that enhance penetration of the integrated system of PV and EV and enable formation of decentralized power systems. As bottom-up processes are critical, policy makers, communities, industries, and researchers should work together to build such systems overcoming social and regulatory barriers. © 2021 The Author(s).","Decentralized power systems; Electric vehicles; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy; Urban decarbonization","Carbon dioxide; Integrated control; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Emerging economies; Governmental intervention; Integrated systems; Regulatory barriers; Urban environments; Cost effectiveness; electric vehicle; electricity supply; solar power; transportation planning; urban area; urban transport","This research was supported by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, Kyoto, Japan.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100747398"

Although several EV models to estimate the charging profile and additional electrical load are available, but they are not capable of providing a high-resolution evaluation of charging current, especially at a higher frequency. This paper presents a probabilistic approach capable of estimating the time-dependent charging and harmonic currents for the future EV load.

The electrification of airport energy system as a micro-grid is a promising solution to achieve zero emission airport operation, however such electrification approach presents the engineering challenge of integrating new energy resources, such as hydrogen supply and solar energy as attractive options to decarbonize the present system. This paper explores the techno-economic benefits of integrating hydrogen supply, electric auxiliary power unit (APU) of aircraft, electric vehicles, photovoltaic energy (PV), and battery storage system into electrified airport energy system. The hydrogen fuel cell generation provides great flexibility to supply aircraft at remote stands, and reduces the carbon emissions caused by traditional fuel-powered APU. A mixed integer linear programming optimization method based on life cycle theory is developed for capacity sizing of hydrogen energy system, PV and battery storage, with optimization objective of minimizing the total economic costs as well as considering environmental benefits of the proposed airport microgrid system. Case studies are conducted by five different energy integration scenarios with techno-economic and environmental assessments to quantify the benefits of integrating hydrogen and renewable energy into airport. Compared with the benchmark scenarios, the integration of hydrogen energy system reduced the total annual costs and carbon emissions of airport energy system by 41.6% and 67.29%, respectively. Finally, sensitivity analysis of key system parameters such as solar irradiance, grid emission factor, elctricity price, carbon tax, unit investment cost of hydrogen energy system have been investigated to inform the design of hydrogen-solar-storage integrated energy system for future airport electrification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Airport; Battery; Electrification; Hydrogen; Microgrid; Multi-energy system; PV; Techno-economic analysis","Airports; Auxiliary power systems; Battery storage; Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Fuel cells; Hydrogen storage; Integer programming; Investments; Life cycle; Microgrids; More electric aircraft; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Auxiliary power units; Battery storage system; Engineering challenges; Environmental benefits; Hydrogen energy systems; Integrated energy systems; Life cycle theories; Mixed integer linear programming; Electric power system economics; airport; alternative energy; electrification; energy planning; energy storage; fuel cell; hydrogen; integrated approach; linear programing; sensitivity analysis; solar power","This work was supported by UK EPSRC Supergen Energy Networks Hub Flexible Fund (SENFC1-023); UK Department for Transport Transport-Technology Research Innovation Grant (T-TRIG2019); National Natural Science Foundation of China (51807127); International Visiting Program for Excellent Young Scholars of Sichuan University.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098956743"

Since PEV FCSs are used simultaneously by a large number of PEVs, they can cause negative effects on electrical networks, including increased losses and voltage deviations. Therefore, optimal siting and sizing of these stations to decrease their negative effects on electrical networks is one of the main challenges in the extensive use of PEVs. In this paper, optimal location and capacity of FCSs and renewable energy sources (RES) are simultaneously determined, while deviation paths and uncertainties of RESs are considered. For this purpose, first a capacitated deviation ﬂow refueling location model (CDFRLM) is proposed to cover the charging demand for PEVs on the transport network. Then, the desired problem is modeled based on the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which can be solved using commercially available softwares. The proposed model is implemented on 14-bus and 33-bus distribution test systems which are coupled with a 25-node transportation network.

Incorporating emerging flexible resources like electric vehicle parking lots (EVPLs) and demand response programs (DRPs) into power systems, could be a good solution to deal with inherent uncertainties imposed by these resources to the power grid. EVPLs can improve power system operating conditions by active and reactive power injection capabilities. The participation of consumers in DRPs can also improve energy consumption management by decreasing or shifting loads to other periods. This paper proposes a hybrid information gap decision theory (IGDT)- stochastic method to solve a transmission-constrained AC unit commitment model integrated with electric vehicle (EV), incentive-based DRP, and wind energy. The behavioural uncertainty related to EV owners is modelled using a scenario-based method. Additionally, an IGDT method is applied to manage wind energy uncertainty under a two-level optimization model. Verification of the proposed model is done under several case studies. Based on the results achieved, the proposed risk-based hybrid model allows the operator to differentiate between the risk level of existing uncertainties and apply a high-flexibility decision-making model to deal with such difficulties. Additionally, the role of the aforementioned flexible resources in the reduction of power system running costs and wind power uncertainty handling are evaluated. Numerical results confirm a 3.7% reduction in the daily operating costs as a consequence of coordinated scheduling of EVPL and DRP. Moreover, Taking advantage of reactive power injection of EVPL provides more cost savings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response program; Electric vehicle parking lot; Emerging flexible resources; Information-gap decision theory; Renewable energy resource; Stochastic programming","Cost reduction; Decision making; Decision theory; Energy utilization; Operating costs; Reactive power; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vehicle transmissions; Wind power; Active and Reactive Power; Coordinated scheduling; Decision making models; Demand response programs; Reactive power injections; Renewable energy source; Scenario-based methods; Two-level optimization; Electric power transmission networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092001848"

An important emerging challenge is managing their less desirable consequences (e.g. grid instability and peak load), particularly in urban environments. We present a solution that matches the temporal nature of PV generation and EV charging. This solution is a simple coordination strategy for EV charging which minimally affects EV availability for drivers while maximizing the PV electricity generation absorbed by EV batteries. The strategy is benchmarked with high-resolution data from a medium-sized European city. We find that this coordination provides large benefits compared to commonly-observed uncoordinated charging patterns across seasons and PV and EV integration levels. With charging coordination, almost 71%–92% of the EV charging load can be provided by solar panels in the summer. However, winter's lower solar irradiance results in a larger range of possibilities (13%–76%), with the exact value depending on the combination of PV and EV integration level. The gains compared to uncoordinated charging are generally highest in winter and similarly vary based on PV and EV integration levels (from 5 to 63 percentage points). Additionally, these benefits do not appear to come at a significant cost to EV availability for drivers. © 2020 The Authors","Electric vehicles; Renewable energy; Solar panels","Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Integration; Photovoltaic cells; Coordination strategy; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity generation; High resolution data; Solar photovoltaic generations; Solar photovoltaic panels; Urban environments; Charging (batteries); benchmarking; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy planning; photovoltaic system; solar power","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096676950"

This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a fundamental energy flexibility quantification framework applicable to various energy systems commonly found in residential buildings (i.e., heat pumps, renewables, thermal and electrical storage systems). Using this framework, the interactions between these systems are analysed, as well as assessing the net energy cost of providing flexibility arising from demand response actions where onsite electricity production is present. A calibrated white-box model of a residential building developed using EnergyPlus (including inter alia a ground source heat pump, a battery storage system, and an electric vehicle) is utilised. To acquire daily energy flexibility mappings, hourly independent, and consecutive demand response actions are imposed for each energy system, using the proposed indicators. The obtained flexibility maps give insights into both the energy volumes associated with demand response actions and qualitative characteristics of the modulated electricity consumption curves. The flexibility potential of each studied energy system is determined by weather and occupant thermal comfort preferences as well as the use of appliances, lighting, etc. Finally, simulations show that zone and water tank thermostat modulations can be suitably combined to shift rebound occurrences away from peak demand periods. These insights can be used by electricity aggregators to evaluate a portfolio of buildings or optimally harness the flexibility of each energy system to shift peak demand consumption to off-peak periods or periods of excess onsite electricity generation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexibility indicators; Residential sector; Smart grid","Electric power generation; Housing; Water tanks; Battery storage system; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Electricity-consumption; Energy flexibility; Qualitative characteristics; Residential building; Thermal energy systems; Geothermal heat pumps; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy planning; energy use; pumping; residential energy; seasonality; thermal power","This work has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland under the SFI Strategic Partnership Programme Grant Number SFI/15/SPP/E3125 and additional funding provided by the UCD Energy Institute.

Buildings and electric transport systems, especially subway systems and Plug in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), are among the major energy consumption systems in a smart city. In this paper, a linear model is proposed for the co-optimization planning and operation of distributed energy resources and transportation systems in an interconnected system that analyzes the interactions of such an interconnected system. The idea of Regenerative Breaking Energy (RBE) is deployed to improve the operation of the subway system through the interconnected subway system in the smart city. For the optimal operation of the smart city, an optimization formulation is devised to minimize the total cost of the city in the presence of subway RBE. In this paper, the traffic and length of the routes are modeled considering Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to Subway (V2S) located in the parking lots. Furthermore, the degradation model is developed to increase the PEVs’ battery life. An unscented transformation (UT) approach is utilized to construct a stochastic framework based on the uncertainty method, to handle the uncertain behaviors of PEVs and distributed energy resource and loads in the smart city.

Although conventional carrier-based modulations (CBMs) and space vector modulations (SVMs) have been commonly applied and extensively studied for three-phase four-leg voltage-source converters, very little has been reported concerning their pollution impact on AC grid in terms of switching ripple currents. This paper introduces a thorough analytical derivation of peak-to-peak and RMS values of the AC current ripple under balanced and unbalanced working conditions, in the case of three-phase four-leg converters with uncoupled AC-link inductors. The proposed mathematical approach covers both phase and neutral currents. All analytical findings have been applied to two industry recognized CBM methods, namely sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (PWM) and centered PWM (equivalent to SVM). The derived equations are effective, simple, and ready-to-use for accurate AC current ripple calculations. At the same time, the proposed equations and diagrams can be successfully adopted to design the conversion system basing on the grid codes in terms of current ripple (or total harmonic distortion (THD)/total demand distortion (TDD)) restrictions, enabling the sizing of AC-link inductors and the determination of the proper switching frequency for the given operating conditions.

The objective of this paper is to find the generation scheduling such that the total operating cost can be minimized, when subjected to a variety of constraints. This also means that it is desirable to find the optimal generating unit commitment in the power system for the next H hours. This paper proposes distributed sources which includes electric vehicles and distributed generation. EPA, which happens to be a Global Optimisation technique for solving Unit Commitment Problem, operates on a system, which is designed to encode each unit’s operating schedule with regard to its minimum up/down time. In this, the unit commitment schedule is coded as a string of symbols. An initial population of parent solutions is generated at random. Here, each schedule is formed by committing all the units according to their initial status (“flat start”). Here the parents are obtained from a pre-defined set of solution’s i.e. each and every solution is adjusted to meet the requirements. Then, a random recommitment is carried out with respect to the unit’s minimum down times. The Neyveli Thermal Power Station (NTPS) Unit-II in India demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach; extensive studies have also been performed for different power systems consists of IEEE 10, 26, 34 generating units. Numerical results are shown comparing the cost solutions and computation time obtained by using the EPA and other conventional methods like Dynamic Programming, Legrangian Relaxation and Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search in reaching proper unit commitment. © 2021, Naresuan University.

The electrification of vehicles is a promising solution to this widespread problem; however, integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into existing grid systems on a large scale creates several problems, both for consumers and for utilities. Accelerated aging of expensive grid assets, such as power transformers, is one of the primary issues that these utilities are facing. This problem can be addressed with battery energy storage systems (BESS), which acts as buffer between demand and supply. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel strategy for optimal sizing of BESS based on thermal loading of transformers. This paper also investigates issues associated with high penetration levels of rooftop photovoltaics (PVs), determining the synergy between EV charging load and BESS. The proposed solution is treated as an optimization problem, in which a new time of use (ToU) tariff is utilized as a demand response signal to reduce the accelerated aging of transformers. Extensive simulation results show that the size of BESS can be considerably reduced based on the proposed methodology, thereby avoiding accelerated aging of transformers without the need to augment existing grids. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Accurate evaluation of the number of EVs penetrating the distribution network, that is, the hosting capacity (HC) of EVs, is beneficial to distribution network planning and efficient operation. Further, EVs have uncertainties in terms of arrival time, departure time, battery state of charge (SOC), and choice of charging station, which collectively affect the system difficult, but important, step of modeling EV uncertainties on system performance. This paper presents a methodology to model how many EVs can penetrate a low voltage distribution network, especially microgrid. First, EV load modeling incorporating uncertainties is performed by applying interval and affine arithmetic. Second, to analyze the effects of voltage, the same arithmetic methods are extended to perform power flow calculation. Thirdly, interval undervoltage probability (IUP) is introduced to evaluate the HC of the EVs. Subsequently, a voltage violation index (VVI) is introduced, and an EV HC evaluation method is proposed, assisting in the flexible operation of the network based on VVI. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated by modeling the network of Seoul National University in South Korea, which is subsequently compared with the conventional approach of determining EV HC. The model incorporated Seoul National University's practical cable data, load data, and vehicle access data, along with the number of EVs penetrating the target network. © 2013 IEEE.","Affine arithmetic; distribution network; electric vehicle; electric vehicle hosting capacity; interval arithmetic; uncertainties; under voltage probability","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric power distribution; Probability distributions; Uncertainty analysis; Voltage distribution measurement; Affine arithmetic; Arithmetic; Electric vehicle hosting capacity; Hosting capacity; Index; Interval arithmetic; Load modeling; Uncertainty; Under voltage probability; Undervoltage; Electric load flow","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116860522"

However, EV charging may also impose significant investment requirement for the power system that needs to be analyzed carefully including the capacity of the existing distribution network system, investments needed in solar PV together with battery storage and additional diesel capacity to meet the incremental demand from EVs. We explore an EV adoption scenario for Maldives for 2030 with 30% of all vehicles including two-wheelers that dominate the transport on the island under two different charging regimes: uncoordinated and optimized coordinated mode. The latter is achieved through a system wide optimization using a modified version of the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM) that optimizes charging load subject to a range of constraints on allowable timing for different categories of vehicles. If charging from the fleet is uncoordinated, a relatively small increase in energy requirement of 3.1% due to EV may lead to a 26.1% increase in generation capacity requirement and hence 15.7% additional investment. While the optimized charging regime helps to drastically cut down on generation capacity requirements to just 1.8% increase and also considerably eases feeder loading, it may also lead to higher emissions as more EV load during off-peak hours lead to an increase in diesel-based generation. We have therefore explored an additional scenario wherein the annual emissions from the power sector are constrained to the baseline ('No EV') scenario. The analysis shows the importance of focused modeling analysis to understand the ramifications of EV load impact on the power system including significant increase in generation capacity and potential increase in power sector emissions in a fossil-fuel dominated system. © 2013 IEEE.","distribution network; Electric vehicles; least-cost planning; power system optimization","Charging (batteries); Diesel engines; Electric automobiles; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Investments; Petroleum transportation; Charging loads; Distribution network system; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy requirements; Generation capacity; Local renewable; Planning models; Transportation cost; Electric loads","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114752501"

This paper presents a techno-economic approach to optimally equip a flexible energy resource, namely a battery energy storage system (BESS), with non-deferrable loads for capacity enhancement of a distribution grid. The proposed approach is generic in applicability, and includes two different optimization mathematical models. The first model quantifies the needed flexibility with non-deferrable loads, based on a consideration of distribution grid limitations, while the second model determines the optimal flexibility amount associated with non-deferrable loads considering investor profitability. Thereafter, a distribution operations model is developed to evaluate the impact of non-deferrable loads, equipped with an optimal size of BESS, on the distribution system loading capacity. An example of non-deferrable loads considered in this paper is that of the rapid charging loads of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that cannot be controlled or shifted due to the short stay of PEVs at a charging facility. Hence, a probabilistic model for PEV rapid charging loads is first developed. Case studies and simulation findings, considering a 32-bus distribution system, demonstrate that the proposed approach helps reduces the impact of non-deferrable loads on a distribution system and enhances the system power margin, which defers the need for system upgrades. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; flexibility; mathematical model; optimization; planning","Energy resources; Energy storage; Plug-in electric vehicles; Solar power generation; Storage as a service (STaaS); Battery energy storage systems; Capacity enhancement; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution operations; Distribution systems; Forecast uncertainty; Probabilistic modeling; Solar photovoltaic generations; Charging (batteries)","This work was financially supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Majmaah University, under Grant RGP-2019-22.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106806599"

However, the increased penetration rate of electric vehicles and expansion of variable renewable energy sources can accelerate the power demand and uncertainty in the power generation output. In this paper, power system analysis is performed through electric vehicle charging demand and wind power outputs prediction, and an electric vehicle charging decentralization algorithm is proposed to mitigate system congestion. In order to predict electric vehicle charging demand, the measurement data were analyzed, and random sampling was performed by applying the weight of charging frequency for each season and time. In addition, wind power outputs prediction was performed using the ARIMAX model. Input variables are wind power measurement data and additional explanatory variables (wind speed). Wind power outputs prediction error (absolute average error) is about 9.6%, which means that the prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm is high. A practical power system analysis was performed for the scenario in which electric vehicle charging is expected to be higher than the wind power generation due to the concentration of electric vehicle charging. The proposed algorithm can be used to analyze power system problems that may occur due to the concentration of electric vehicle charging demand in the future, and to prepare a method for decentralizing electric vehicle charging demand to establish a stable power system operation plan. © 2013 IEEE.","charging demand; charging station; Electric vehicle; security analysis; wind generating resources; wind power forecasting","Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric power generation; Electric power system planning; Electric substations; Natural resources; Systems analysis; Traffic congestion; Weather forecasting; Wind; Wind power; Electric vehicle charging; Explanatory variables; Power system analysis; Power system operations; Prediction accuracy; Renewable energy source; Security analysis; Variable renewable energies; Vehicle-to-grid","This work was supported by the Korea Electric Power Corporation under Grant R18XA06-55.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104663341"

We analysed the probability distribution of energy consumption and its relation to indicators characterising charging events to gain basic insights. The energy consumption can be satisfactorily modelled by a transformed beta distribution and the number of charging transactions is the driving factor among the characteristics constituting the energy consumption. We collected geospatial datasets and prepared a large number of candidate features modelling the spatial context in which the charging infrastructure operates. Using statistical methods, we identified and interpreted a relatively small subset of the most influential features correlated with energy consumption. The majority of these features are related to the economic prosperity of residents. Residents and businesses with high (low) income, situated nearby charging infrastructure, are linked to a positive (negative) impact on energy consumption. Similarly, charging infrastructure located close to expensive newly built housing shows higher energy consumption. The largest adverse impact has the high concentration of residents receiving social assistance. By applying the methodology to a specific charging infrastructure class, e.g. determined by the used rollout strategy, we differentiated the selected features. Business types, working sector of residents and public venues in the proximity are linked to higher consumption of energy at charging infrastructure deployed strategically. Characteristics linked with the age structure of the population are linked to the energy consumption at charging infrastructure placed based on the demand. Data collection and data processing are among the most time-consuming activities. The paper provides valuable insights into which data to collect and use as features when developing prediction models to inform charging infrastructure deployment and planning of power grids. © 2013 IEEE.","charging infrastructure; Electric vehicles; energy consumption; variable selection","Charging (batteries); Data acquisition; Electric power transmission networks; Large dataset; Predictive analytics; Probability distributions; Beta distributions; Charging infrastructures; Consumption of energy; Data-centric approaches; Distribution of energy consumption; Economic prosperity; Prediction model; Spatial context; Energy utilization","This work was supported in part by the research project ‘‘Data Analysis Methods and Decisions Support Tools for Service Systems Supporting Electric Vehicles’’ under Grant VEGA 1/0089/19, in part by the ‘‘Allocation of Limited Resources to Public Service Systems with Conflicting Quality Criteria’’ under Grant APVV-19-0441, in part by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under Contract SK-IL-RD-18–005, in part by the Operational Program Integrated Infrastructure 2014–2020 ‘‘Innovative Solutions for Propulsion, Power, and Safety Components of Transport Vehicles’’ through the European Regional Development Fund under Grant ITMS313011V334, and in part by the Operational Program Research and Innovation in the frame of the project: ICT Products for Intelligent Systems Communication, through the European Regional Development Fund under Grant ITMS2014+313011T413.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103879895"

Among these applications, AMI is playing an important role in delivering data from customers to power utilities, supporting reliable real-time monitoring, and remote operation of power quality data and voltage profile. The AMI consists of smart meters, data aggregation points (DAPs), the utility control center, and communication networks. Appropriate network planning plays an essential role in facilitating the exchange of data between consumers and power utilities as well as accommodating new smart grid applications and future growth. This work proposes an optimal placement of DAPs for AMI based on machine learning clustering techniques in residential grids. Network partitioning is introduced to create sub-networks and graph algorithms generate a deployment topology given optimization constraints. A new measurement metric called coverage density is considered to indicate neighborhood area networks (NAN) zones with the appropriate coverage. Three real scenarios of NAN are considered: urban, suburban, and rural.

Optimal allocation of battery energy storage systems for distribution networks based on probabilistic power flow (PPF) is an effective solution to deal with these uncertainties. However, the high computational burden is the main obstacle of this method. Therefore, this paper proposes a surrogate-assisted multi-objective probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) to reduce the expensive computational time. The surrogate model is developed by using a machine learning method namely deep learning which is used for bypassing the deterministic load flow calculation. Zhao's point estimation method combined with Nataf transformation is selected to handle the PPF analysis considering correlated uncertain input variables. The multi-objective POPF problem is solved using the multi-objective differential evolution. The historical data including solar irradiation, ambient temperature, residential load, and electric vehicle (EV) travel distance is calculated in the low voltage distribution system to demonstrate the potential advantages of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed surrogate assisted multi-objective POPF method provides the optimal solution for operating cost, helps to prolong transformer life and reducing environmental impact. Moreover, the results show that the proposed surrogate-assisted optimization framework gives a better solution when comparing with the conventional surrogate-assisted method. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; carbon emission; deep learning; multi-objective differential evolution; probabilistic power flow; transformer loss of life; Zhao's point estimation method","Acoustic generators; Deep learning; Digital storage; Domestic appliances; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Evolutionary algorithms; Housing; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Optimization; Probability distributions; Solar power generation; Turing machines; Voltage distribution measurement; Battery energy storage systems; Electric vehicle charging; Low Voltage distribution system; Multi-objective differential evolutions; Probabilistic optimal power flow (P-OPF); Probabilistic optimal power flows; Probabilistic power flow; Surrogate-assisted optimizations; Electric load flow","This work was supported in part by the Faculty of Engineering, Khon Kaen University, under Grant Ph.D.Ee-1/2562, and in part by the National Research Council of Thailand under the program Research Grant for New Scholar.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101768641"

The growing number of Internet-of-things (IoT) high-wattage appliances, such as air conditioners and electric vehicles, being connected to the power grid, together with the high dependence of ICT and control interfaces, make CPES vulnerable to high-impact, low-probability load-changing cyberattacks. Moreover, the side-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate a modification of electricity consumption patterns with utilities experiencing significant net-load and peak reductions. These unusual sustained low load demand conditions could be leveraged by adversaries to cause frequency instabilities in CPES by compromising hundreds of thousands of IoT-connected high-wattage loads. This article presents a feasibility study of the impacts of load-changing attacks on CPES during the low loading conditions caused by the lockdown measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, FCS location planning must consider the requirements of electricity and transportation infrastructures simultaneously. This paper, for the first time, proposes a graph-computing based integrated location planning model, which maximizes PEV charging convenience while ensuring the power grid's reliability. In addition, the proposed model captures the long-term costs of critical grid assets induced by uncertainty and impulsiveness of charging demand. Finally, the model can be easily scaled to various coupling configurations and temporal resolutions through a graph-based scheme. The proposed model is cast as a multi-objective mixed-integer problem and is solved by the cross-entropy (CE) optimization algorithm, in which the computational efficiency is significantly improved with graph parallel computing techniques. The proposed planning model and graph implementation method are validated on a synthetic power-transportation coupled network. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Fast charging station; graph computing; impact assessment; location planning; power grid","Computational efficiency; Electric loads; Electric power system planning; Fast charging (Batteries); Graph algorithms; Graphic methods; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Integer programming; Location; Plug-in electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Fast charging stations; Mixed integer problems; Optimization algorithms; Parallel computing techniques; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Temporal resolution; Transportation infrastructures; Transportation services; Electric power transmission networks","Manuscript received October 15, 2019; revised April 21, 2020; accepted June 3, 2020.

Defining unit commitment problem in a competitive environment to maximize the profit of GENCOs while satisfying all the network constraints is called Profit Based Unit Commitment problem (PBUC). The main contribution of this paper is modeling and inclusion of Market Clearing Price (MCP) in PBUC problem. In Day market, MCP is determined by market operator which provides maximum social welfare for both GENCOs and Consumers.On other hand this paper proposes a novel combination of solution methodology: Improved Pre-prepared power demand (IPPD) table and Analytical Hierarchy method (AHP) for solving the optimal day ahead scheduling problem as an another contribution. In this method, the status of unit commitment is obtained by IPPD table and AHP provides an optimal solution to PBUC problem. Minimizing total operating cost of thermal units to provide maximum profit to GENCOs is called an optimal day ahead scheduling problem. Also it will be more realistic to redefine this problem to include multiple distributed resources and Electric vehicles with energy storage. Because of any uncertainties or fluctuation of renewable energy resources (RESs), Electric vehicles (EV) can be used as load, energy sources and energy storage. This would reduce cost, emission and to improve system power quality and reliability. So output power of solar (P<inf>S</inf>), wind output power (P<inf>W</inf>) and Electric Vehicles power (P<inf>EV</inf>) are modeled and included into day ahead scheduling problem.The proposed methodology is tested on a standard thermal unit system with or without RESs and EVs. Cost and emission reduction in a smart grid by maximum utilization of EVs and RESs are presented in this literature. It is indicated that the proposed method provides maximum profit to GENCOs when compared to other methodologies such as Memory Management Algorithm, Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Muller method, Gravitational search algorithm etc. © 2020, The Author(s).","Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) solar output power (pS); Electric vehicles power (pEV); Generation companies (GENCOs); Improved pre-prepared demand (IPPD) table; Wind output power (pW)","Constraint satisfaction problems; Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Electromagnetic wave emission; Emission control; Energy storage; Hierarchical systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Analytical hierarchies; Competitive environment; Gravitational search algorithms; Market clearing prices; Memory management algorithms; Profit based unit commitment; Restructured power systems; Unit commitment problem; Power markets","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092927788"

This work sets out to design an effective PID controller for LFC in an island Micro-grid (MG) and also proposes a model for EVs to contribute to LFC system. To this end, particle swarm optimisation (PSO) based artificial neural network (ANN) technique is considered to tune the parameters of PID controller in MG structure.

This is due to the intermittent generation of RESs and uncertain loads of PEVs, both of which necessitate enhancing the flexibility requirements at the distribution level so as to accommodate the high penetration of these clean technologies in the future. To address such issues, this study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming-based expansion planning model for DNs considering the impact of high RES and PEV penetration, the associated uncertainties, and providing flexibility requirements at the distribution level. In this respect, the spherical simplex unscented transformation, an analytical uncertainty modelling method, is implemented in the planning model to take into account the forecasting errors of the uncertain green technologies. Also, in order to estimate the electric vehicle parking lot demand at each load node of the network, a new approach for PEV-charging model is suggested. To investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed probabilistic planning model, it is implemented on two test DNs, and the obtained results are thoroughly discussed. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020","","Electric automobiles; Electromagnetic wave emission; Forecasting; Integer programming; Internet protocols; Mathematical transformations; Renewable energy resources; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Analytical uncertainty; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Low-carbon technologies; Mixed integer linear programming; Oriented distributions; Probabilistic planning; Renewable energy source; Unscented transformations; Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097330320"

Their success offers great opportunities for the decarbonization of the transport sector, but also pose new challenges to energy infrastructures. Public charging stations must be built and power grids may become congested. In this article, we analyze the optimal layout and operation of charging systems along highways. We introduce an optimization model that resolves every single charging event based on actual high-resolution demand profiles, thus providing a detailed account of infrastructure operation and utilization. We discuss the economic viability and identify potential roadblocks impeding a rapid build-up of electric mobility.We find that the installation of high-performance charging stations is highly profitable even for rather low demand, mainly due to the spread between wholesale and retail electricity prices. Congestion of regional distribution grids becomes a serious issue already for a moderate market penetration of electric vehicles. While peak loads can be handled by battery electric storage systems, the grid connection fundamentally limits the total amount of cars that can be served per day.

Therefore, this study proposed a coordinated charging scheduling method for EVs in microgrid to shift load demand from peak period to valley period. In the proposed method, the charging mode of EVs was selected based on a charging urgency indicator, which can reflect different charging demand. Then, a coordinated charging scheduling optimization model was established to minimize the overall peak-valley load difference. Various constraints were considered for slow-charging EVs, fast-charging EVs, and microgrid operation. Furthermore, Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) was used to simulate the randomness of EVs. The results have shed light on both the charging modes selection for EV owners and peak shaving and valley filling for microgrid operation. As a result, this model can support more friendly power supply-demand interaction to accommodate the increasing penetration of EVs and the rapid development of flexible microgrid. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Charging demand; Coordinated charging; Electric vehicles; Optimal load scheduling","Electric automobiles; Fast charging (Batteries); Landforms; Microgrids; Scheduling; Charging demands; Charging modes; Coordinated charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Microgrid operations; Operation of power system; Scheduling methods; Scheduling optimization; Monte Carlo methods; electric vehicle; energy conservation; energy planning; Monte Carlo analysis; operations technology; optimization; power plant","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71822104 and 71521001 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. JZ2018HGPA0271 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091912711"

One recent test case, initiated by the Dutch Transmission System Operator (TSO), was to operate an Electric Vehicle (EV) fleet on the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) market, which entails fast and automated reserves. To achieve that in a decentralised, automated and transparent manner, the role of blockchain technology for this specific application is explored. We propose a novel configuration that can serve as a basis for deploying distributed assets for aFRR markets using blockchain or any alternative Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Automation can be achieved via the deployment of smart contracts, which also results in transparency in the system. The blockchain configurations are designed for three phases in the aFRR market, namely: (i) Operational planning and scheduling by a balancing service provider (i.e., formulation and submission of aFRR bid), (ii) Real-time operations (i.e., activation and measurements), and (iii) Verification and settlement (i.e., imbalance correction and financial settlement). The paper concludes that the scalability of distributed assets that can participate in the system, combined with the large transaction times and energy consumption of some consensus mechanisms, could put limitations on the proposed architecture. Future research should address benchmarking studies of other alternatives (e.g., DLTs, such as the ones based on directed acyclic graphs, and non-DLT solutions) with the proposed blockchain solution. © 2020, MDPI AG.

In this paper, we consider optimal operation of a cyber-physical system (CPS) comprising a large fleet of SAEVs and a set of charging hubs located across the transportation network and supported by the power grid. The hubs are considered to have a number of charging stations, a stand-alone battery bank for energy storage, and limited rooftop photo-voltaic (PV) generation capacity. We developed a robust mixed integer linear programming model. It considers a number of practical features of both the power and transportation systems, including day-ahead load commitment for electricity via an alternative current power flow model, real time price spikes of electricity, energy arbitrage, uncertainty in passenger demand, and balking of passengers while waiting for a ride. We demonstrated our methodology by implementing it on a sample CPS with 500 SAEVs and five hubs with fifty charging stations in each. Our methodology yields operational decisions for day ahead commitment of power and real time control of the SAEVs and the hubs. The sample CPS is used to examine impact of hub capacity and fleet size on various system performance measures. We discuss the computational challenges of our methodology and propose a simplified myopic approach that is capable of dealing with much larger fleet sizes and a variety of hub capacities. Reduction in computation time and the optimality gap for the myopic approach are examined. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ACOPF; Cyber–physical system; Energy arbitrage; Robust optimization; Shared autonomous electric vehicles; Stochastic optimization","Autonomous vehicles; Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Embedded systems; Integer programming; Real time control; Urban transportation; Computational challenges; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Mixed integer linear programming model; Operational decisions; Passenger transportation; System performance measures; Transportation network; Transportation system; Fleet operations; automation; computer system; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy planning; operations technology; performance assessment; real time; smart grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090956697"

To evaluate the suitability of a specific site, two sets of constraints are considered: one addresses the technical aspects that may constrain the economically achievable power capacity; the other addresses the policy aspects that may affect the likelihood of receiving planning permission for an otherwise technically feasible scheme. Overall technical and policy ratings are determined and the outcome displayed on a 10 m × 10 m grid across the city. The output maps allow users to determine the overall suitability of any given site and identify the specific technical or policy aspects that might impede a proposed deployment. Application of GOMap to the city of Glasgow indicated that the potential contribution of deploying PVPS on unconstrained Vacant and Derelict Land is equivalent to the annual heating energy requirement of 21.8% of dwellings in the hard-to-heat category. This finding is significant in relation to the Scottish Government's energy strategy that calls for the electrification of building heating in a manner that alleviates fuel poverty. Alternatively, the generated energy is equivalent to 26.6% of the energy requirement of Glasgow's car fleet if this was converted to electric vehicles. The paper describes the scoring and weighting methods as applied to the policy and technical aspects and their underlying factors, and presents the outcome of an application of GOMap to quantify the PVPS potential for the city of Glasgow.

This paper addressed the optimal sizing and allocation of the fast-charging stations in a distribution network. The traffic flow of EVs is modeled using the User Equilibrium-based Traffic Assignment Model (UETAM).

The system power loss and node voltage excursion can be effectively reduced, by taking measures of time-of-use (TOU) price mechanism bonded with the reactive compensation of energy storage devices. Firstly, the coordinate charging/discharging load model for EV has been established, to obtain a narrowed gap between load peak and valley. Next, a multi-objective optimization model of the distribution grid is also defined, and the active power loss and node voltage fluctuation are chosen to be the objective function. For improving the efficiency of optimization process, an advanced genetic algorithm associated with elite preservation policy is used. Finally, reactive compensation capacity supplied by capacitor banks is dynamically determined according to the varying building loads. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on the IEEE 33-node test case, and the simulation results show that the power supply pressure can be obviously relieved by introducing the coordinated charging/discharging behavior of EV; in the meantime, via reasonable planning of the compensation capacitor, the remarkably lower active power loss and voltage excursion can be realized, ensuring the safe and economical operation of the distribution system. © 2020, The Author(s).","Advanced genetic algorithm; Coordinated dispatch; Distribution network; Electric vehicles; Multi-objective optimization","Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Genetic algorithms; Vehicle-to-grid; Advanced genetic algorithms; Compensation capacitors; Coordinated charging; Coordinated dispatch; Multi-objective optimization models; Preservation policies; Reactive compensation; Time of use prices (TOU); Multiobjective optimization","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (2017JJ5044).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078810428"

Distributed generation and load uncertainties, recast in two-stage stochastic programming, are tackled with a scenario generation and reduction technique using a probabilistic approach with Kantorovich metrics. The final number of the scenarios are validated with an alternative clustering method. A flow-based location–allocation theory with user equilibrium traffic assignment model is exploited to site charging stations.

The proposed framework is solved with a multiobjective Tchebycheff decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm and tested on a modified 54 bus distribution network and 25 transportation node system.

Nonetheless, the associated problems such as uncertainty in production-load sides, voltage instability, and power loss augmentation should be reanalyzed. These predicaments can be dealt to some extent with proper siting and sizing of WDGs together with capacitor banks (CBs) as a conventional voltage regulator and reactive power compensator. However, the sizing and siting problem consists of various objectives, such as voltage stability improvement, emission reduction, and cost reduction. It is a great challenge to optimize these contradictory objectives altogether. Hence, to overcome all these struggles, this paper proposes a tri-objective optimization formulation for optimal planning of WDGs and CBs in the power system, considering uncertainties derived from PEVs’ load demand, wind speed, and conventional load. The objectives to be optimized are, namely, voltage stability index, total cost, and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, this study assimilates an unaccustomed type of point estimate method (PEM) into strength Pareto multi-objective differential evolution algorithm, which is not only computationally light but also reasonably accurate. Moreover, chance-constrained programming is integrated into the PEM using a maximum entropy method to deal with smooth constraints. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated by the Monte-Carlo simulation. Eventually, the proposed algorithm is compared with other standard multi-objective metaheuristic optimization algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chance constrained programming; Multi-objective optimization; Plug-in electric vehicle; Point estimate method; Sizing and siting; Wind distributed generation","Computer programming; Cost reduction; Distributed power generation; Electric automobiles; Electric circuit breakers; Emission control; Evolutionary algorithms; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Maximum entropy methods; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Planning; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Wind; Chance-constrained programming; Multi-objective differential evolution algorithms; Multi-objective metaheuristics; Objective optimization; Point estimate method; Reactive power compensator; Voltage stability improvement; Voltage stability index; Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088899810"

The transition to clean electrified mobility must be considered from the sustainability spectrum, and the planning of a strategy related to the implementation of electric vehicles implies, from the beginning, providing clean energy conditions to go toward a green-to-green paradigm. It should be noted that the successful implementation of the “green electro mobility” concept depends heavily on the green energy supply solutions of green electric vehicle, so Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EV-CS) should be powered by electricity generation systems based on green resources. This research article has as main objective the environmental impact assessment from the perspective of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions embedded in green stand-alone energy systems and the estimation of the environmental benefits of their implementation in the power supply of EV-CS from the perspective of avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions compared to the classic electricity supply grid.

The hybrid power system considered in this work includes thermal generating units, RERs such as wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) units, battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs). Here, the two objective functions are formulated, i.e., minimization of operating cost and system risk, to develop an optimum scheduling strategy of hybrid power system. The objective of proposed approach is to minimize operating cost and system risk levels simultaneously. The operating cost minimization objective consists of costs due to thermal generators, wind farms, solar PV units, EVs, BESSs, and adjustment cost due to uncertainties in RERs and EVs. In this work, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is considered as the risk index, and it is used to quantify the risk due to intermittent nature of RERs and EVs. The main contribution of this paper lies in its ability to determine the optimal generation schedules by optimizing operating cost and risk. These two objectives are solved by using a multiobjective-based nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) algorithm, and it is used to develop a Pareto optimal front. A best-compromised solution is obtained by using fuzzy min-max approach. The proposed approach has been implemented on modified IEEE 30 bus and practical Indian 75 bus test systems. The obtained results show the best-compromised solution between operating cost and system risk level, and the suitability of CVaR for the management of risk associated with the uncertainties due to RERs and EVs. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Battery energy storage; electric vehicles; multiobjective optimization; renewable energy resources; system risk level; uncertainty","Energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Operating costs; Pareto principle; Scheduling; Value engineering; Wind power; Battery energy storage systems; Compromised solution; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Pareto-optimal front; Scheduling strategies; Thermal generating units; Solar power generation; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy storage; optimization; photovoltaic system; risk factor; solar power","This work was supported by the Woosong University [Woosong University’s Academic Research Funding - (20019-2020)].","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089693078"

This integration requires an appropriate planning to achieve the future sustainable distribution network. Real EV charging demand is stochastic and affected by many uncertainties, which pose challenges to the planning of a charging station. This study presents a stochastic planning model of the EV charging station with photovoltaic (PV), battery and transformer, mainly considering the uncertainties from charging demand and PV power generation. Firstly, a comprehensive EV charging demand model is established through reflecting the coupling among the EV stochastic charging behaviour, charger specifications and EV charging assignment model. Then, the planning model is formulated to minimise the total cost of the charging station, where the uncertainties arising from EV charging are addressed in various constraints. Using this model, the optimal sizing of the charging station is determined, together with the associated optimal operation strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by multiple case studies. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

To solve this problem while considering the potential of the large-scale charge load of electric vehicles (EVs), an aggregator-based demand response (DR) mechanism for EVs that are participating in the peak regulation in valley time is proposed in this study. In this aggregator-based DR mechanism, the profits for the power grid's operation and the participation willingness of the EV owners are considered. Based on the characteristics of the EV charging process and the day-ahead unit generation scheduling, a rolling unit commitment model with the DR is established to maximize the social welfare. In addition, to improve the efficiency of the optimization problem solving process and to achieve communication between the independent system operator (ISO) and the aggregators, the clustering algorithm is utilized to extract typical EV charging patterns. Finally, the feasibility and benefits of the aggregator-based DR mechanism for saving the costs and reducing the peak-valley difference of the receiving-end power grid are verified through case studies. © 2020 Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization","Aggregators; Demand response; Electric vehicles; Peak regulation in valley time; Rolling unit commitment","Clustering algorithms; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Landforms; Vehicle-to-grid; Demand response; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Generation scheduling; Independent system operators; Optimization problems; Peak regulation capacity; Social welfare; Unit-commitment; Electric power transmission networks","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Project from the State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company of China (52094019006U) and the Shanghai Rising-Star Program (18QB1400200).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107480403"

This flexibility can result in realizing the globally optimal solution of the leader's objective function, while controlling the reaction function of the followers, simultaneously. We consider an aggregator who purchases energy from the wholesale energy market. The aggregator acts as the leader for a group of plugged in electric vehicles (PEVs) and determines the price of energy versus consumption at each hour a day as its decision function. In the followers level, since the optimal charging strategies of the PEVs are coupled through the electricity price, the PEVs in a group are considered to cooperate in finding their Nash-Pareto-optimal charging strategy, by minimizing a social cost function. For a large number of PEVs, the cooperative cost minimization of PEVs can be modeled as a cooperative mean-field (MF) game. We propose a decentralized MF optimal control algorithm and prove that the algorithm converges to leader-follower MF \varepsilon _{N}-Nash equilibrium point of the game. Furthermore, a decentralized reverse Stackelberg algorithm is implemented to achieve the optimal linear price function of the leader. Simulation results and comparison with benchmark methods are performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-The effect of a large population of PEVs on the power grid such as overload and voltage drop is inevitable. Motivated by this, there are many research articles which propose different centralized and decentralized charging coordination solutions to address this problem. The core idea in the most of literature is: 'How to IMPLEMENT a demand response (DR) program appropriately for charging coordination problem to avoid high peak load?' However, none of them propose a practical algorithm on 'How to DESIGN a DR optimally by having limited information from the clients?' We propose a bilevel optimization algorithm to both design a DR program (i.e., price function) and also implement DR program to flatten the demand curve, accordingly. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the information structure of the problem is close to reality. There is no information exchange among the clients and also the utility company does not need to know the private information of the clients. The Utility Company only knows the charging profile of the PEVs in each day and broadcasts the price signal to the clients for the next day. The method is illustrated in an IEEE 5-bus system that supports our claims. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Decentralized; mean-field game; PEV charging coordination; reverse Stackelberg game","Cost functions; Curve fitting; Pareto principle; Bi-level optimization; Coordination problems; Demand response programs; Information exchanges; Information structures; Nash equilibrium point; Optimal control algorithm; Wholesale energy market; Electric power transmission networks","Manuscript received August 2, 2019; accepted March 27, 2020.

Hence, this study investigates potential grid congestions on the basis of three contrasting load approaches applied to four different grid regions. Within the three load approaches, temporal characteristics of various grid customer classes (EVs, HPs, households etc.) are derived from highly resolved realistic load profiles. In accordance with classic grid planning, firstly a static load approach is analyzed by applying the modeled coincidence for each consumer class individually. Secondly, this static approach is modified by including combined coincidence factors, taking temporal consumer class interactions into account. Finally, both static load approaches are compared with detailed annual time series analyses by means of load flow simulations using real‐life LV grid data. The evaluation of inadmissible voltage characteristics and thermal congestions identifies future grid extension needs depending on the considered grid region. In addition, the variation of the applied load approach highlights the need to consider consumer-specific temporal behavior. In fact, by neglecting temporal interactions between conventional and future grid customers, the classic grid planning approach overestimates future grid extension needs. To counteract an oversizing of future grid structures, this paper presents a combined consideration of EVs' and HPs' coincidence as well as resulting grid consequences on the LV level. © 2020 by the authors.

In this article, we conduct a new study on the coupled dynamic expansion problem of EVPLs placement and distribution networks. To reach this goal, at first, EVs driving and charging/discharging behavior as some influential factors is modeled using an efficient probabilistic algorithm. An analytical model is then introduced to estimate the number of EVs in EVPLs at different times. To find out the optimal place for installing EVPLs and distribution network reinforcement, a multiobjective (MO) optimization model is formulated considering the main requirements of EVs users, EVPLs owners, and distribution system operators. A linear model is also derived for the energy monument of EVs in EVPLs and residential charging stations to be used in the mentioned MO expansion problem. Numerical results with various cases are presented to illustrate the main advantages of the proposed coupled expansion model. The simulation results indicate increasing the percentage of participated EVs in V2G leads to reduce the DNO costs and increase the EVPLs' revenues.

However, the lack of historical charging data, as well as consideration on the temperature and traffic, pose obstacles to establish an accurate model. This paper presents a spatial-temporal EV charging load profile simulation method considering weather and traffics. First, the impacts of temperature on battery capacity and air-conditioning power are formulated. Second, the energy consumed by air conditioning and car-driving under various traffic conditions is formulated after defining two traffic-related indices. Third, the refined probabilistic models regarding the spatial-temporal vehicle travel pattern are established to improve accuracy. Daily charging load profiles at multiple regions are generated with inputs of refined models and formulations based on Monte Carlo.

Therefore, considering the high penetration of electric vehicles, it is necessary to propose new models and strategies for this problem. The present study proposes a new multi-stage model to expand the distribution network based on the bilevel optimization taking the plug-in electric vehicles into account. In the upper level, whose objective function is the total annualized investment cost plus annual expected production and maintenance cost, the investment and utilization decision variables are identified. In comparison, in the lower problem, whose objective function is the cost of purchased energy from the main grid, the daily optimal scheduling is determined. By using primal-dual formulation, this bilevel optimization is recast as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. A 24-node distribution network is used to show the efficiency, tractability, and economic advantages of the proposed methodology. The results indicate that the DEP with the smart charging strategy will lead to less investment cost compared with the case in which the dumb charging strategy is utilized. In addition, the results show that the optimal solution of the proposed bilevel model is superior to the optimal solution of the model in which the smart charging problem is solved in a separate optimization problem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bilevel optimization; Distributed generation; Distribution expansion planning; Plug-in electric vehicle; Primal-dual formulation","Costs; Integer programming; Investments; Optimal systems; Bi-level optimization; Charging strategies; Expansion planning problems; Mixed integer linear programming problems; Multi stage modeling; Objective functions; Optimization problems; Primal-dual formulations; Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083444604"

Moreover, in recent years, due to the increasing number and severity of weather-related events, several operational solutions have been proposed to increase the resilience of power systems. For instance, in the distribution part of power systems, dynamic micro-grid (MG) formation can enhance resilience by means of distributed energy resources (DERs) when the main grid is unavailable. Following this concept, the capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs) such as vehicle-to-grid make it possible to use the energy stored inside them to restore critical loads. Therefore, the aggregation of EVs in the distribution system can be seen as a DER from the system operator viewpoint, and operators can benefit from this limited energy resource in MG formation. This study uses two types of EV aggregation for this purpose, i.e. a public parking lot and a residential parking. To improve system performance when using these resources, two steps should be taken: (i) employing a master-slave control technique in each MG and (ii) using a demand-side management programme. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.","","Demand side management; Disasters; Electric power system planning; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Microgrids; Restoration; Vehicle-to-grid; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Limited energy resource; Master slave control; Operational solutions; Power distribution system; Power system operators; Electric power transmission networks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089379522"

Along the same line, self-healing is one of the most distinguishing features of the smart grid that could improve the reliability of the system up to a logical extent. In this study, the reliability of the electrical distribution grid has been improved by optimal allocation of automatic switches and parking lots (PLs). Thus, the optimal places of switches and PLs are determined with the purposes of minimising a combined effect of the customer-based (system average interruption duration index) and cost-based [total reliability cost (TRC)] reliability indices. The TRC includes customer interruption costs, PLs and automatic switches investment costs, and the total cost of PLs incorporation in the service restoration process. The proposed approach is implemented in three different planning scenarios: Switch placement, PL placement, and joint switch and PL placement. The particle swarm optimisation method is employed to solve optimisation problems.

However, in those regions where coal is a dominating power generation fuel source, different opinions about whether EVs can help emission reduction exist. In other words, whether EVs can help emission reduction depends on the energy system configuration and the power generation mix. To achieve the overall emission reduction in both systems, a collaborative planning strategy for electricity and transportation systems is proposed. In the electricity distribution network, the renewable energy source is planned to cope with future demand growth due to the increasing use of EVs. In the transportation network, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are introduced to realize the coordinated development of different types of vehicles. The location of the hydrogen refueling stations can be planned, and the penetration ratio of internal combustion vehicles, EVs, and FCVs is optimized. The proposed planning model is verified on the 46-bus electricity distribution network and the 21-bus transportation network. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and subgradient methods are employed to solve the proposed optimization model.

Controlling the charging schedule of electric vehicles in a coordinated manner provides a potential solution to mitigate the issues and could defer reinforcement of network infrastructure. This work presents a method for robust, cost-minimizing, day-ahead scheduling of overnight charging of electric vehicles in low voltage networks in a stochastic environment with minimal real-time adaptation. To reduce the computational complexity, a linear power flow approximation is utilized. The stochastic environment captures multiple uncertainties arising from the mobility behavior including stochastic daily trip distances, arrival and departure times. Knowledge about the probability distributions of these parameters is used to hedge risks regarding the cost of charging, network overloading, voltage violation, and charging reliability. The results on a test network provide an insight into the impact of uncertainty and the effectiveness of addressing aspects of risk during optimization. In particular, planning with more conservative estimates of initial battery charge levels increases the reliability and technical feasibility of optimized schedules. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Charging; distribution networks; electric vehicles (EVs); optimization; uncertainty","Electric load flow; Electric vehicles; Motor transportation; Probability distributions; Risks; Scheduling; Stochastic systems; Voltage distribution measurement; Day-ahead scheduling; Electric vehicle charging; Low voltage network; LV distribution networks; Network infrastructure; Optimized schedule; Real-time adaptation; Stochastic environment; Charging (batteries)","Funding text 1: Manuscript received November 8, 2019; revised February 4, 2020 and March 15, 2020; accepted March 16, 2020.

This study proposes a stochastic method for modeling the PEV charging demand, of which the time and amount are uncertain. In the proposed method, the distribution of PEVs is estimated by the substations based on the number of electricity customers, PEV expansion target, and statistics of existing vehicles. An individual PEV charging profile is modeled using the statistics of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles driving and by aggregating the PEV charging profiles per 154 kV substation, the charging demand of PEVs is determined for consideration as part of the total electricity demand in the planning process of transmission systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through case studies in the Korean power system.

Economic feasibility still stands out as the primary goal of commercial MGs. A stationary electrical energy storage system (ESS) is often a central component of MGs, facilitating islanding and cost-effective management of main grid use. Therefore, previous research has focused on the sizing of stationary ESS. The advent of large-scale electric vehicle (EV) charging hub MGs (CHMGs) such as the one along the freeway A8 near Augsburg, Germany, profoundly changes the economically optimal capacity of stationary ESS. While it is well conceived that EVs can be aggregated and then compensated for stationary ESS, research still lacks quantifiable evidence and methodological guidance on how the charging strategy (immediate, controlled, bidirectional) influences the economically optimal capacity of the stationary ESS. To address this gap, this paper proposes a method that includes a mixed-integer linear programming model for scheduling decisions under various conceivable ESS capacities and provides scenario analyses on the EV charging strategies as well as on ESS cost. Thereby, the method thus identifies the economically optimal capacity of the ESS. The results show that in the considered CHMG near Augsburg, the stationary ESS sizing decision is relevant in all but extreme scenarios. In particular, the economically optimal stationary ESS capacity soars if more than 65% of the EVs begin to charge immediately and the storage costs falls below 150 EUR/kWh. In contrast, smaller portions of controlled charging EVs can already drastically reduce stationary ESS. Remarkably, this paper also gives quantitative evidence that investments in bidirectional charging do not to pay off in the CHMG near Augsburg. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery sizing; Charging hub; Charging strategies; Commercial microgrid; Stationary electrical energy storage; Vehicle-to-grid","Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Integer programming; Investments; Microgrids; Charging strategies; Controlled charging; Cost-effective management; Economic feasibilities; Electric vehicle charging; Electrical energy storage systems; Mixed integer linear programming model; Scheduling decisions; Economic and social effects; electric vehicle; electrical power; energy storage; quantitative analysis; smart grid","The authors would like to thank Theresa Mack for preliminary interviews with the project partners and fruitful discussions with regard to our modelling approach.

Aiming at the impact of the uncertainty of electric vehicle on the power grid, an optimized dispatching method of hybrid energy storage systems based on multiobjective optimization in the scenario of tracking plan output is proposed in this paper. The predicted value of the photovoltaic power obtained by the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-back propagation (BP) neural network is used to formulate the planned output of photovoltaic power generation, and the principle component analysis algorithm is used to extract the main features affecting photovoltaic power generation to further improve the prediction accuracy of photovoltaic output power. From the perspective of the service life of electric vehicles, a two-stage optimal control method of hybrid energy storage systems based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is used to achieve energy distributions between electric vehicles and supercapacitors. Fully consider the benefits of electric vehicle users and the capacity of tracking plans, a multiobjective optimization model of hybrid energy storage systems to track planned output is established, and the nondominated sorted genetic algorithm-III is adopted to solve the model. The validity of the model is verified by a simulation test of actual operating data of a business park in China. The simulation results show that after the optimized control, the average absolute error of the deviation power reduces from 1.092 to 0.0528 MW, power fluctuating times of electric vehicles decreases from 151 to 80, and the daily income benefit increases from $404.468 to $483.116 in the cloudy day.

The methodology considers the design features of an electric vehicle and evaluates its energy and power requirements as to fulfil a driving cycle. The work starts by weight minimizing a fuel cell taking into consideration its physical and electrochemical characteristics. Batteries and ultracapacitors are then sized according to their dynamic response features and considering specifications from commercial candidate cells, to propose an electric configuration and specify the baseline for a hybrid power plant. In order to illustrate the methodology, a crossover utility electric vehicle and a WLTC class I drive cycle are used. This work shows that by reducing the power plant size, power and energy requirements can also be minimized and the overall performance can be increased promoting fuel and costs savings. For comparison and to show the impact of weight minimization on the energy on board and cost, this work presents the energy and power required by different power plant configurations. Results showed that including ultracapacitors to the power plant offers more benefits, such as less stress on batteries, at a marginal initial cost compared to a case without ultracapacitors, where batteries should attend transients with a limited capability for energy recovery from regenerative breaking.

This paper proposes a new solution methodology incorporated recent metaheuristic approach of competition over resource (COR) for evaluating the optimal allocations and sizes of parking lots installed in radial distribution network. The main target is enhancing the network reliability with achieving minimum cost. COR is easily implemented with achieving feasible convergence for confident solution. A new formula of objective function comprising reliability enhancement cost, power loss improvement cost, and investment cost is proposed. The COR approach is applied on 9-bus, 33-bus, and 69-bus radial distribution networks. Additionally, the algorithms of grey wolf optimizer (GWO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and water cycle algorithm (WCA) are programmed and their results are compared with those obtained via the proposed COR. For 9-bus network, the proposed COR achieved saving of 6628.835 $ with percentage of 1.47% than GWO and time benefits of 84.11%. Moreover, it achieved economic benefits of 5315.4578 $ with percentage of 0.57% with time benefits of 7.6% compared to WCA for 33-bus network.

While the role of renewable-based micro-grids in enhancing communities’ energy resilience is well-appreciated, the academic literature on the techno-economic optimisation of community-scale micro-grids lacks a quantitative decision support analysis concerning the inclusion of a minimum resilience constraint in the optimisation process. Utilising a specifically-developed, time-based resilience capacity characterisation method to quantify the sustainability of micro-grids in the face of different levels of extended grid power outages, this paper facilitates stakeholder decision-making on the trade-off between the whole-life cost of a community micro-grid system and its degree of resilience.

However, controlled EV charging could largely mitigate these issues, transforming EVs from a grid liability into a valuable asset. In this study, we model the evolution of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid, located in the midwestern United States (U.S.) with large numbers of forecasted EVs and renewable generation by the late 2030s, over the period 2019–2039. Uncontrolled charging leads to peak load increases of up to 10% or 8 GW, and exacerbated ramping requirements. In contrast, controlled charging significantly ameliorates these challenges, with unidirectional (“V1G”) charging largely avoiding peak load increases, filling valley loads and reducing ramp rates. Bidirectional (“V2G”) charging provides much larger load flexibility to dramatically reduce peak loads and ramp rates. This study investigates EV load growth in the midwestern U.S. and the impact that different types of controlled charging can have on mitigating the grid challenges presented both by large numbers of EVs and increasing levels of renewable generation. Moreover, above ~3 million EVs, V2G charging can exhibit multi-day optimization behavior and very high load flexibility, suggesting the possibility of new load planning tools extending over multiple days. Such capabilities would provide significant aid in optimally scheduling resources with a larger percentage of intermittent renewables. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Controlled charging; Electric vehicle; Multi-day optimization; Peak shaving; Vehicle-to-grid","Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Independent system operators; Intermittent renewables; Ramping requirements; Renewable electricity; Renewable generation; Scheduling resources; Uncontrolled charging; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electricity; electricity generation; future prospect; optimization; quantitative analysis; Midcontinent; United States","This research was sponsored by MISO under Strategic Partnership Agreement FP00005451 .

Therefore, the smart grid technology based on preliminary calculation parameters of the energy system develops in cities. This area should also be used to organize the charging infrastructure of electric vehicles, as the electrification of road transport is one of the global trends.

In such an intelligent environment, it is possible and imperative to consider the traffic flow guidance for electric and non-electric vehicles in the urban transportation network. However, this has not yet been considered in the challenges of planning multi-energy systems. Based on these considerations, a novel optimal planning framework is proposed in the present study, that takes into account the coupling of transportation, natural gas and active distribution networks. Firstly, a novel structure of integrated energy stations is proposed, which serves as coupling components where various sources of energy can be converted, distributed, and stored. The model optimizes the investment and operational strategies of renewable energy generation, energy converters, storage devices and charging facilities in a coordinated way. To capture the impact of traffic flow, a mixed user equilibrium state was established. Thus, the route selections for non-electric vehicles and the navigations of electric vehicles to charging facilities could both be incorporated into the model. Since the proposed planning model is a mixed-integer nonlinear program problem, convex relaxation was conducted to transform the model formulations into a mixed-integer second order cone program version. Finally, four cases were designed and tested in a practical urban area. The quantitative comparison revealed that unguided traffic flow will increase the traffic costs by more than 23%. Moreover, when both charging and routing guidance are considered the energy losses will decrease by at least 5.6%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Active distribution network; Integrated energy station; Mixed user equilibrium; Smart multi-energy system; Traffic flow guidance; Transportation network","Electric vehicles; Energy dissipation; Integer programming; Investments; Natural gas; Nonlinear programming; Planning; Relaxation processes; Renewable energy resources; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Virtual storage; Active distribution networks; Intelligent environment; Mixed integer nonlinear program; Operational strategies; Quantitative comparison; Renewable energy generation; Second order cone programs; Urban transportation networks; Natural gas transportation; alternative energy; distribution system; electric vehicle; energy planning; natural gas; numerical model; operations technology","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 51977156 .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084457590"

Nevertheless, they bring about adversities such as uncertainty in production-load sides, augmented power loss, and voltage instability in the power system, which should be carefully addressed to increase the reliability. In this concern, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization methodology for sizing and siting of SDGs, WDGs, and capacitor banks (CBs) in the power system considering uncertainties stemmed from PEVs load demand, solar irradiance, wind speed, and the conventional load. The understudy objectives are the voltage stability index, green-house gas emissions, and the total cost. An unconventional point estimate method (PEM) is used to handle the related uncertainties, and chance-constrained programming method is deployed to deal with smooth constraints. The corresponding probability distribution functions of output variables are estimated by the maximum entropy method. Furthermore, robustness analysis is made by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed methodology is applied to a typical radial distribution network. The results show that the presence of PEV's significantly increases the load demand, which results in voltage collapse in the distribution system without the presence of distributed generations. However, the proposed probabilistic method ensures the safe operation of the distribution system with the optimal allocation of renewable distributed generations and CBs. Moreover, the results of deterministic and probabilistic cases are compared under different penetration levels of PEVs. The best tradeoff solution of the Pareto front is selected by the fuzzy satisfying method. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chance constrained programming; Multi-objective optimization; Point estimate method; Renewable distributed generation; Sizing and siting","Computer programming; Constrained optimization; Distributed power generation; Distribution functions; Electric automobiles; Electric circuit breakers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Maximum entropy methods; Monte Carlo methods; Multiobjective optimization; Plug-in electric vehicles; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Chance-constrained programming; Distribution systems; Point estimate method; Probabilistic methods; Radial distribution networks; Renewable distributed generations; Sizing and siting; Voltage stability index; Electric power system planning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079037121"

It thus becomes of vital importance to efficiently manage the Electro-Mobility for large demand from EVs. Due to limited cruising range of EVs, vehicles have to make frequent stops for recharging, while long charging period is one major concern under plug-in charging. We herein leverage battery swapping (BS) technology to provide an alternative charging service, which substantially reduces the charging duration (from hours down to minutes). Concerning in practice that various battery is generally not compatible with each other, we thus introduce battery heterogeneity into the swapping service, concerning the case that different types of EVs co-exist. A battery heterogeneity-based swapping service framework is then proposed. Further with reservations for swapping service enabled, the demand load can be anticipated at BS stations as a guidance to alleviate service congestion. Therefore, potential hotspots can be avoided. Results show the performance gains under the proposed scheme by comparing to other benchmarks, in terms of service waiting time, etc. In particular, the diversity of battery stock across the network can be effectively managed. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Battery switch; E-mobility; Electric Vehicle; Transportation planning","Benchmarking; Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric switches; Secondary batteries; Battery swapping; Battery switch; Charging periods; Cruising range; E mobilities; Electro mobilities; Grid infrastructures; Power grids; Service operations; Transportation planning; Electric vehicles","Manuscript received May 14, 2019; revised August 26, 2019, December 3, 2019, and March 2, 2020; accepted April 16, 2020.

In this scenario, the use of energy storage systems (ESSs) could be an effective solution to reduce the peak power request by CSs in PAs to the grid. Moreover, II-Life battery modules are a potential approach for cutting costs and implementing sustainable solutions. We propose a method to size ESSs coupled to CSs by using II-Life battery modules.

Heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) emit a large share of GHG emissions in the transport sector and are therefore the subject of growing attention from global regulators. Fuel cell and green hydrogen technologies are a promising option to decarbonize HDVs, as their fast refueling and long vehicle ranges are consistent with current logistic operational requirements. Moreover, the application of green hydrogen in transport could enable more effective integration of renewable energies (RE) across different energy sectors. This paper explores the interplay between HDV Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) that produce hydrogen locally and the power system by combining an infrastructure location planning model and an electricity system optimization model that takes grid expansion options into account. Two scenarios – one sizing refueling stations to support the power system and one sizing them independently of it – are assessed regarding their impacts on the total annual electricity system costs, regional RE integration and the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The impacts are calculated based on locational marginal pricing for 2050. Depending on the integration scenario, we find average LCOH of between 4.83 euro/kg and 5.36 euro/kg, for which nodal electricity prices are the main determining factor as well as a strong difference in LCOH between north and south Germany. Adding HDV-HRS incurs power transmission expansion as well as higher power supply costs as the total power demand increases. From a system perspective, investing in HDV-HRS in symbiosis with the power system rather than independently promises cost savings of around seven billion euros per annum. We therefore conclude that the co-optimization of multiple energy sectors is important for investment planning and has the potential to exploit synergies. © 2020 The Author(s)","Alternative fuel vehicle; Electricity system modeling; Fuel cell; Heavy-duty vehicles; Hydrogen refueling network; Optimization; Sector coupling","Costs; Economics; Electric power systems; Expansion; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Investments; Vehicles; Electricity prices; Heavy duty vehicles; Hydrogen refueling stations; Hydrogen technologies; Integration of renewable energies; Investment planning; Locational marginal pricing; Operational requirements; Electric power system planning; alternative fuel; electric vehicle; energy planning; future prospect; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; transportation planning; Germany","Funding text 1: Philipp K.

However, these new concerns may have an adverse effect on the complexity of the operation of the network, they present great opportunities to the network operators for a better service, in terms of lower costs and enhanced security. In this paper, the integration of the coordinated aggregated Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) fleets and Demand Response Programs (DRPs) into power systems is studied using the stochastic reliability-based Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC). The proposed SCUC program minimizes network operation costs while determining the best strategy for deployment of PEVs and DRPs. Moreover, the proposed approach analyze the effect of these resources on the adequacy of the power system by considering reliability metrics Being a mobile power storing device enables the PEVs to provide their energy to the network when called upon. Moreover, DRPs can mitigate power consumption during the peak load or in case of a contingency. Optimal integration of these resources could reduce the network operating costs and improve security. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model is employed for power system modeling in a smart grid environment. In the proposed model, PEV fleets are modeled as virtual power plants that can provide electric power while DRPs are assumed to only affect the power consumption of the customers. The proposed paradigm is applied to the IEEE 6-bus and IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) to illustrate its effectiveness. Numerical analyses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in lessening the cost of network operations, better performance in case of contingencies and a higher level of reliability. © 2020","Demand response programs; Electric vehicles; Reliability; Smart grid; Stochastic SCUC","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083304791"

The high penetration rate of EVs, as new electrical energy demands, can cause operational problems for distribution networks. Therefore, designing and implementation of monitoring and management mechanisms for EVs charging is a necessity. EVs are equipped with power electronic-based chargers, bringing them a high degree of flexibility in conjugate active and reactive power control. This capability can be employed not only to reduce the adverse impacts of the high penetration rate of EVs on distribution networks operation but also to support the active and reactive management in distribution networks. In this paper, to employ EVs conjugate active and reactive power control capability, a model for central active and reactive power management in a smart distribution network is proposed. The proposed model is an optimization problem in which the objective function consists of two terms, namely, “minimizing the cost of energy” and “improving the voltage profile”, over the operation planning horizon. The constraints of the optimization problem include distribution network operation constraints and charging and discharging constraints related to the EVs batteries and chargers. This problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem and is implemented on the 33-bus, 69-bus, and 133-bus distribution networks. The results show that the proposed model can obtain the lowest energy cost and energy loss and the best operational voltage profile in a completely acceptable calculation time. Moreover, by using the proposed model, supplying the required energy for EVs during their plugin time interval is guaranteed and, increasing the penetration rate of EVs into the network is facilitated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Conjugate active and reactive power management; Electric vehicles; Mixed-integer linear programming; Smart distribution network operation","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082196751"

This article reduces the number of photovoltaic outputs and load scenarios by the K-means++ clustering algorithm to obtain a typical scenario set. Additionally, we propose a bi-level programming model for the coordinated DG and EVCSs planning problem. The maximisation of annual overall profit for the power supply company is taken as the objective function for the upper planning level. Then, each scenario is optimised at the lower level by using active management strategies. The improved harmonic particle swarm optimisation algorithm is used to solve the bi-level model.

In apartment complexes, which have emerged as a common residential type in metropolitan areas and highly populated districts, high charging demand could result in substantial stress to distribution networks. In this work, the effect of EV charging power demand in an apartment complex on the aging of the Distribution Transformer (DT) is studied. A methodology based on the stochastic characterization of vehicle usage profiles and user charging patterns is developed to obtain realistic EV charging demand profiles. Based on the modeled EV charging profile and the transformer thermal model, the effect of different EV penetration ratios on DT aging for an apartment complex in the Republic of Korea is studied. Results for an EV penetration ratio of up to 30% indicated that DT aging could be accelerated by up to 40%, compared to the case without EV charging. To mitigate this accelerated DT aging caused by EV charging, the effectiveness of two integration approaches of Photovoltaic (PV) sources was studied. Based on a case study that included a realistic PV generation profile, it was demonstrated that a significant contribution to DT reliability could be achieved via the operation of PV sources. A more apparent contribution of PV integration was observed with an energy storage installation at higher EV penetration ratios. At an EV penetration ratio of 30%, a maximum decrease of 41.8% in the loss-of-life probability of the DT was achieved. The effects of different PV integration approaches and power management details on DT aging were also studied. The results demonstrate that the EV charging demand could introduce a significant level of stress to DTs and that this impact can be effectively mitigated by installing PV sources. These observations are expected to contribute toward the effective planning of power system infrastructures that support the design of sustainable cities with the widespread use of EVs. © 2020 by the authors.

To this end, an adaptive robust optimization approach is proposed for the expansion planning problem of a distribution system where expansion decisions involve the construction of renewable generating units, storage units, and charging stations for electric vehicles. The problem is formulated under the perspective of a central planner that aims at determining the expansion plan that minimizes both investment and operation costs. Both short-term variability and long-term uncertainty are considered in the proposed approach and are modeled in different ways. Short-term variability of the demand, the production of stochastic units, and the price of electricity withdrawn from or injected into the transmission system is modeled using a number of representative days corresponding to different operating conditions. Long-term uncertainty in the future peak demands, the future value of electricity exchanged with the transmission grid, and the number of electric vehicles is instead modeled through confidence bounds. A case study based on a 69-node distribution network shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the relationship between the optimal expansions decisions, the revenues from selling electricity to the electric vehicles, the degree of independence from the transmission system, and the role played by the investment budget availability. Moreover, an ex-post decarbonization analysis is conducted to evaluate the environmental impact of the adoption of electric vehicles.

One possible way to use EVs in energy balancing is to let each distribution system mitigate its forecast uncertainties through the flexibility of EVs. In consideration of the difficulties to directly govern a large number of EVs, it is more reasonable for distribution systems to dispatch electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs). Without influencing driving activities of EVs in the next day, a model is established for distribution systems to make use of EVAs, whose contributions are delaying uncertainties through their temporal flexibility and thus creating opportunities for uncertainties from different hours to offset each other. In the established model, a scheme of uncertainty transferring is proposed to relieve interruption to EVAs and distributionally robust optimization is adopted to evaluate the operation plans' average performance with temporal and spatial uncertainty correlations considered. Comprehensive case studies are carried out based on charging demands of EVAs simulated from real traffic data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","day-ahead planning; Distribution system; distributionally robust optimization; electric vehicle aggregator; temporal flexibility; uncertainty mitigation","Energy balance; Optimization; Charging demands; Distribution systems; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy-balancing; Forecast uncertainty; Operation plan; Robust optimization; Temporal and spatial; Electric automobiles","Manuscript received April 14, 2019; revised September 5, 2019 and October 21, 2019; accepted October 27, 2019.

In this paper, wind distributed generations (WDGs) are planned based on vehicle to grid (V2G) operation mode of PEVs. The optimal long-term planning is based on optimal short-term scheduling considering all related uncertainties. A comprehensive model of the batteries degradation is considered in the objective function. A two-layer optimization procedure is proposed in which the optimal location and capacity of WDGs are determined in first layer, while optimal charge and/or discharge of PEVs are scheduled in the second layer, subject to technical constraints. The numerical results delineate the capability of PEVs in V2G operation mode for wind energy dispatching in WDGs planning. The simulation results show the storage capability of PEVs will increase by their number growing. Therefore, the operation and planning costs of WDGs will be reduced if the PEVs penetration to be high. The capacity of installed WDGs in smart charging scenario is less than uncoordinated charging scenario as the PEVs properly dispatch WDGs in smart charging strategy. Moreover, the results show that the PEVs battery degradation cost limit the participation rate of PEVs in WDGs dispatching. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery degradation; Electric distribution network; Smart charging; Vehicle to grid; WDGs planning","Charging (batteries); Distributed power generation; Electric discharges; Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Plug-in electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Battery degradation; Comprehensive model; Optimization procedures; Short-term scheduling; Smart charging; Technical constraints; Techno-economic evaluation; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Secondary batteries","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080038291"

With possibly millions of such vehicles operating across the smart cities, smart grid energy providers can be directly impacted by the charging of EV batteries. In order to reduce this impact and optimize energy saving, in this article, we propose a coordinated model for scheduling the plug-in of EVs for charging and discharging energy. The model is based on a new decentralized Fog architecture for smart grid in order to reduce the completion and communication delay of EV energy demand scheduling. To enhance the scheduling of EV demands and predict the future energy flows, we propose a plug-in system of EVs based on calendar planning. We develop a mathematical formalism based on Markov chains using a multipriority queuing theory with cut-off discipline in order to reduce the waiting time to plug-in. We implement three planning algorithms in order to assign priority levels and then optimize the plug-in time into each EV public supply station. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that proposes a model that tries to save energy by planning the plug-in of EVs using a cut-off priority queuing model and a decentralized Fog architecture.

This work presents a coordinated approach for the planning of PEV charging facilities and DGs, including both the locations and the capacities, with the consideration of the transportation - power network couplings. First, the PEV charging demand is characterized by a temporal-SoC (State of Charge) analysis, and the DG generation uncertainties are modeled by K-means clustering using historical data. The M/M/s/N queuing model is used to formulate the dynamics of charging stations and then obtain the optimal station capacity, including the number of chargers and waiting spaces. Furthermore, the placement of charging stations is optimized by the Floyd Algorithm to minimize the total distance to obtain charging service. Finally, the sitting and sizing of DGs are optimized over multiple objectives, including active power losses, reactive power losses, and voltage deviation. The solution is evaluated through a case study of the IEEE 53-bus test feeder coupled with a 25-node transportation network. It is shown that the proposed solution enables the active and reactive power losses as well as the voltage deviation to be reduced by 37.6%, 44.3%, and 33.6%, respectively, after the optimal integration of PEV charging stations and DGs. The scalability and effectiveness of the solution are further validated in an IEEE 123-bus test feeder coupled with the same transportation network, and the result confirms the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed solution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Charging facility; Distributed generator; Plug-in electric vehicle; Power distribution network","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Couplings; Distributed power generation; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; K-means clustering; Plug-in electric vehicles; Queueing theory; Reactive power; Scalability; Uncertainty analysis; Active and reactive power loss; Charging facilities; Distributed generator (DGs); Distributed generators; Generation uncertainty; Hierarchical planning; Power distribution network; Transportation network; Electric power system planning; algorithm; electric vehicle; energy planning; hierarchical system; integrated approach; optimization; uncertainty analysis","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51777183 ) and The Major Scientific Project of Zhejiang Lab (No. 2018FD0ZX01 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077663451"

Combining battery storage system, wind farms can be operated as conventional power plants which promotes the integration of wind power into the power grid. However, high expenses on batteries keep investors away. Retired EV batteries, fortunately, still have enough capacity to be reused and could be obtained at a low price. In this work, a two-stage optimization of a wind energy retired EV battery-storage system is proposed. The economic performance of the proposed system is examined concerning its participation in the frequency containment normal operation reserve (FCR-N) market and the spot market simultaneously. To account uncertainties in the wind farm output, various electricity market prices, and up/down regulation status, a scenario-based stochastic programming method is used. The sizing of the equipment is optimized on top of daily operations of the hybrid system which formulates a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Scenarios are generated with the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and Roulette Wheel Mechanism (RWM), which are further reduced with the simultaneous backward method (SBM) to increase computational efficiency. A 21 MW wind farm is selected as a case study. The optimization results show that by integrating with a retired EV battery-storage system (RESS) and a bi-directional inverter, the wind farm can increase its profits significantly when forwarding bids in both of the aforementioned electricity markets. © 2019","FCR-N market; MILP; Retired EV battery-storage system (RESS); Spot market","Commerce; Computational efficiency; Electric batteries; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electromagnetic wave emission; Hybrid systems; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Power markets; Power plants; Profitability; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Battery storage system; Bi-directional inverters; Conventional power plants; EV battery; MILP; Mixed-integer linear programming; Spot market; Two stage optimizations; Battery storage","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074887003"

The model considers investment, production and maintenance cost and identifies the substations and feeders to be built, reinforced or replaced. Owing to the increasing penetration of PEVs into the distribution network, traditional strategies to expand the network have to be updated to cope with the new uncertainties incurred by the PEVs integration. In this regard, a two-stage scenario-based strategy is presented, in which the uncertainties related to the PEVs are modelled via stochastic optimisation using Monte Carlo simulation. In the first stage, the binary decision variables (here and now decision variables) are determined, whereas in the second stage, the optimal production of substations and optimal charging of PEVs (wait and see decision variables) are identified in a day-ahead electricity market. Moreover, the daily electricity price and load volatilities have also been taken into account. The DEP problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and is solved using the efficient Benders' decomposition algorithm.

This paper proposes an optimization framework for the energy management and scheduling of operation for Low Voltage (LV) networks assuring both admissible voltage magnitudes and minimized line congestion and voltage unbalances. The proposed tool allows the utilization and coordination of On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) distribution transformers, BESS, and flexibilities provided by DER. The methodology is framed with a multi-objective three phase unbalanced multi-period AC Optimal Power Flow (MACOPF) solved as a nonlinear optimization problem. The performance of the resulting control scheme is validated on a LV distribution network through multiple case scenarios with high microgeneration and EV integration. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is additionally demonstrated by deriving the most efficient placement and sizing BESS solution based on yearly synthetic load and generation data-set. A techno-economical analysis is also conducted to identify optimal coordination among assets and DER for several objectives. © 2020 by the authors.","Active distribution networks; Low voltage networks; Multi-period optimal power flow; Multi-temporal optimal power flow; Unbalanced networks","congestion; distribution system; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy management; energy storage; installation; model validation; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation","Funding: This project has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Grant No. 675318 (INCITE).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085112681"

The hybrid AC/DC microgrid is a promising alternative for existing power distribution systems to achieve the goal of nearly/net zero energy buildings (nZEBs). However, the increasing demand for compact structure, seamless integration of distributed generators (DGs) and loads, as well as more control flexibility of hybrid microgrids cannot be adequately satisfied by conventional grid architectures. In view of this, an integrated and reconfigurable hybrid AC/DC microgrid architecture with its hierarchical control strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a novel interlinking converter named smart interlinking unit (SIU) is presented, which can provide multiple AC/DC interfaces and diverse operation modes with various control functionalities. Secondly, the SIU-based hybrid microgrid architecture and its hierarchical control structure are established. The dedicated interfaces and cluster controllers for electric vehicles (EVs) facilitate the implementation of centralized vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service. Thirdly, a hierarchical control strategy of SIU, which involves local control in primary control level and power flow control in secondary control level, is introduced to realize coordinated operation of microgrid. The model of the proposed hybrid microgrid architecture is built, and the simulation results demonstrate that the microgrid architecture and hierarchical control strategy can achieve a reliable and coordinated system operation under various kinds of scenarios. Additionally, the mutual power support between AC and DC sub-grids is realized with increased utilization and local consumption of renewable energy resources (RESs). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hierarchical control structure; Hybrid AC/DC microgrid architecture; Local control; Power flow control; Smart interlinking unit (SIU)","Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Flow control; Greenhouse gases; Microgrids; Reconfigurable architectures; Renewable energy resources; Vehicle-to-grid; Zero energy buildings; Hierarchical control structure; Hybrid ac/dc microgrid; Local control; Power flow controls; Smart interlinking unit (SIU); Power control; alternative energy; autonomy; energy efficiency; energy planning; flow control; greenhouse gas; residential energy","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Project 61773195 .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079208254"

For this purpose, a long-term generation and transmission expansion co-optimization model is used, which captures the hourly operational dynamics of the system by means of the use of representative days. This is relevant since smart charging schemes for Electric Vehicles (EVs) are available, and their benefits are intertwined with the hourly available generation (especially solar), the level of demand, and the transmission capacity. Private and public EVs’ demand is considered through five main scenarios, which differ in the number of EVs and the charging strategies used (i.e., upon-arrival charging or smart charging). The analysis is illustrated using the Chilean power grid. The numerical results show that a massive penetration of EVs in the Chilean power generation system will heavily encourage solar power capacity investments. Furthermore, smart charging allows for an additional increase in the solar power installed, leading (in the Chilean case) to an extra 2.4% increase in solar power generation and an additional 2.5% decrease in fossil fuel-based generation, which was commonly used to offer flexibility to the system. These effects are diminished if a high-enough level of solar power is not feasible. In addition, some sensitivity analyses are made in order to identify the specific influences of some of the model parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Flexibility; Power system expansion planning; Smart charging; Solar power","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Expansion; Fossil fuels; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Vehicle transmissions; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Flexibility; Power generation systems; Power system expansion planning; Smart charging; Transmission capacities; Transmission expansion; Electric power system planning; demand analysis; electric vehicle; electrification; numerical method; optimization; penetration; power generation; scenario analysis; smart grid; solar power","Funding text 1: The research reported in this paper was partially supported by the CONICYT, FONDECYT/Regular 1190253 grant and by the CONICYT, FONDAP 15110019 grant (SERC-CHILE).; Funding text 2: The research reported in this paper was partially supported by the CONICYT , FONDECYT /Regular 1190253 grant and by the CONICYT, FONDAP 15110019 grant (SERC-CHILE).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078453845"

The capacitated flow refueling location model is considered in the upper level to minimize the planning cost of fast-charging stations while the traffic assignment model is utilized in the lower level to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of plug-in electric vehicle flows over entire transportation networks. Such bi-level model unveils the inherent relationship among charging demands, electrical demands and the spatial and temporal distribution of plug-in electric vehicle flows. Robust chance constraints are formulated to characterize the service abilities of fast-charging stations under distribution-free uncertain charging demands, where the ambiguity set is constructed to estimate the potential values of the uncertainties based on their moment-based information, such that the robust chance constraints can exactly be reduced to mixed integer linear constraints. By introducing new variables, the bi-level model is then reformulated into a single-level mixed integer second-order cone programming model so as to be solved via off-the-shelf solvers, which guarantee the optimality of the solution. A case study is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed planning model, which reveals three critical factors that significantly impact the planning outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Distribution network; Fast-charging station; Mixed integer second order cone programming; Plug-in electric vehicle; Robust chance constraint; Transportation network","Computer programming; Electric power distribution; Integer programming; Plug-in electric vehicles; Traffic control; Uncertainty analysis; Bilevel programming models; Chance constraint; Chance-constrained programming; Fast charging stations; Second-order cone programming; Spatial and temporal distribution; Traffic assignment models; Transportation network; Fast charging (Batteries); demand analysis; electric vehicle; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal distribution; transportation; uncertainty analysis","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the reviewers and the editor for their valuable suggestions and comments which have led to a much improved paper.

Many studies related to EV charge scheduling found in the literature assume perfect or highly accurate knowledge of energy demand for EVs expected to arrive after the scheduling is performed. However, in practice, there is always a degree of uncertainty related to future EV charging demands. In this work, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based smart charging strategy is developed, which takes this uncertainty into account, both in terms of the timing of the EV arrival as well as the magnitude of energy demand. The objective of the strategy is to reduce the peak electricity demand at an EV parking lot with PVarrays. The developed strategy is compared with both conventional EV charging as well as smart charging with an assumption of perfect knowledge of uncertain future events. The comparison reveals that the inclusion of a 24 h forecast of EV demand has a considerable effect on the improvement of the performance of the system. Further, strategies that are able to robustly consider uncertainty across many possible forecasts can reduce the peak electricity demand by as much as 39% at an office parking space. The reduction of peak electricity demand can lead to increased flexibility for system design, planning for EV charging facilities, deferral or avoidance of the upgrade of grid capacity as well as its better utilization. © 2020 by the authors.","Demand forecasting; Electric vehicle; Peak shaving; Robust optimization; Smart charging","Charging (batteries); Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Forecasting; Model predictive control; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; Degree of uncertainty; Demand forecasting; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Increased flexibility; Peak electricity demand; Peak shaving; Robust optimization; Smart charging; Electric power transmission networks","Funding: This research was funded by the European Funds for Regional Development through the Kansen voor West program grant 00113 for the project, Powerparking, as well as the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research as part of the Uncertainty Reduction in Smart Energy Systems (URSES+) grant for the project ‘Car as Power Plant-LIFE’.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081746342"

The current dynamics and trends of the research area were defined on the basis of the results of an analysis of the database of 255 PS-OS-presenting papers published from December 2015 to July 2019. Eleven main characteristics of the current PS OSs were identified. The results of the statistical analyses give four characteristics of PS OSs which are currently the most frequently presented in research papers: OSs for minimizing the price of electricity/OSs reducing PS operation costs, OSs for optimizing the operation of renewable energy sources, OSs for regulating the power consumption during the optimization process, and OSs for regulating the energy storage systems operation during the optimization process. Finally, individual identified characteristics of the current PS OSs are briefly described. In the analysis, all PS OSs presented in the observed time period were analyzed regardless of the part of the PS for which the operation was optimized by the PS OS, the voltage level of the optimized PS part, or the optimization goal of the PS OS. © 2020 by the authors.","Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy storage; Load control; Microgrids; Optimal power flow; Optimization methods","Electric energy storage; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy storage; Microgrids; Press load control; Renewable energy resources; Electrical power system; Energy storage systems; Optimal power flows; Optimization method; Optimization researches; Optimization system; Power system optimization; Renewable energy source; Electric power system planning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081626773"

A new conceptual design of mobile battery energy storage systems has been proposed in recent studies to reduce the curtailment of renewable energy while limiting the public costs of battery energy storage systems. This work designs a logistics system in which electric semi-trucks ship batteries between the battery energy storage system and electric vehicle charging stations, enabling the planning and operation of power grid independent electric vehicle charging station networks. This solution could be viable in many regions in the United States (e.g., Texas) where there are plenty of renewable resources and little congestion pressure on the road networks. With Corpus Christi, Texas and the neighboring Chapman Ranch wind farm as the test case, this work implement such a design and analyze its performance based on the simulation of its operational processes. Further, we formulate an optimization problem to find design parameters that minimize the total costs. The main design parameters include the number of trucks and batteries.

This creates an urgent demand for uncertainty modelling tools. Under this context, this paper proposes a two-stage robust optimization model for expansion planning of coupled active distribution and transportation. This model identifies the best type, location and capacity for roads, distribution lines, distributed generations, static VAR compensators, on-load tap changers, energy storage systems and charging facilities. From a system-level perspective, the steady-state pattern of the traffic flow in a transportation network is characterized by the Wardrop user equilibrium. In the active distribution system, the conic relaxation-based branch flow equations are employed, and the operating status of related devices are formulated by the linearized convex constraints. Considering the interdependency between two coupled systems, a deterministic expansion planning model is first established. Furthermore, with multiple uncertainties considered, a two-stage robust optimization model is proposed to optimize the investment and operation strategies coordinately, and thus a robust optimal solution is achieved. A two-level algorithm based on a combination of the column-and-constraint generation and outer approximation technique is developed for solving the two-stage model. The results demonstrate that the robust approach can effectively reduce the operation cost of coupled systems under the worst-case scenarios. Moreover, a comparative analysis indicates that operation costs in both systems increase linearly as the uncertainty level of traffic demand increases, while increasing that of the power load does not show an obvious change in the traffic operation cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Active distribution system; Electric vehicle; Transportation network; Two-stage robust optimization; Uncertain renewable energies","Approximation algorithms; Cost benefit analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Expansion; Investments; Operating costs; Optimization; Stages; Static Var compensators; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Voltage control; Active distribution systems; Energy storage systems; Renewable energies; Robust optimal solutions; Robust optimization; Robust optimization models; Transportation network; Urban transportation networks; Urban transportation; algorithm; alternative energy; distribution system; electric vehicle; energy storage; expansion; optimization; uncertainty analysis","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51977156 ) and a scholarship from the China Scholarship Council (No. 201906270125 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077061081"

Then a scheduling model of electric vehicles on time dimension was established based on the processed data. The mathematical model could meet the operation requirements of grid side and user side. The grid-side optimization minimized the system's equivalent load fluctuation, and the user-side was optimized to maximize the charging capacity of electric vehicles. The mathematical model was solved by the genetic algorithm toolbox in Matlab software. Besides, we obtained the quantity distribution of BEV access to the power grid, parking time distribution, parking duration distribution and initial state of charge (SOC) distribution at the beginning of charging by analyzing the real-world driving data. These distribution curves were used to obtain the driving and charging habits of BEV drivers. By comparing the optimized orderly charging strategy with the random charging, in the case of meeting the user's demand for charging power, the peak and valley difference and the equivalent load fluctuation of the power grid were significantly reduced by 22 and 22.7%, respectively.

For integration of PEVs, proper planning of PEV charging stations is necessary. Location and size of fast charging stations (FCSs) are very important for distribution companies (DISCOs) and FCS investors. In this paper, FCS planning problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) from DISCO point of view. The proposed method is based on the dynamic auction, and a co-evolutionary genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem. FCS investors bid DISCO for energy in different locations. The DISCO, as the auctioneer, determines the location and size of FCSs based on the bids received at each location so that its profit is maximized. In the proposed model, capacitor and feeder installations are considered to satisfy the bus voltage limit and the apparent power capacity constraint of feeders, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical results. Our work shows that the proposed method can be used as a proper tool for fast FCS optimal planning in the presence of private investors of FCSs. Furthermore, in the new environment of power systems, dynamic auctions can be utilized in FCS planning. In addition, the capacitor and feeder installations can be effectively used for getting a better value of DISCO objective function. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Auction; Co-evolutionary genetic algorithm; Distribution company; Fast charging station; Plug-in electric vehicle","Charging (batteries); Feeding; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Location; Nonlinear programming; Numerical methods; Planning; Privatization; Auction; Co-evolutionary; Distribution companies; Fast charging stations; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Numerical results; Objective functions; Private investors; Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075392752"

Existing modelling frameworks include “top down” models that offer a comparisonofinvestmentandinvestmentstrategiesbetween scenarios and “bottom up” models that consider detailed technical impacts on real networks. These frameworks are broadly appropriate for analysing investment, with the requirements of the business, stakeholders and regulator influencing the specific model design and implementation. There are a number of dimensions across network engineering, investment, customers and energy markets to be captured and represented in the modelling at some level. This paper presents a number of advanced modelling techniques which can be applied to both top-down and bottom up modelling frameworks, enabling better consideration of customer variability, network risk and optioneering of solutions. Drawing on Bayesian statistics, customer load has been represented using a sophisticated statistical model that reflects both variability and uncertainty in demand on LV networks. This can help to explicitly quantify network risk due to existing loads, new loads and customer flexibility. A network ‘emulator’model provides significantly faster run-times for analysis of large solution sets by parameterising the variables of a power flow model against the inputs. This has been applied and tested with LV, HV and EHV networks with results closely matching equivalent power flow models. Implemented in combination with the Bayesian customer load model enables probabilistic, risk-based modelling. A constrained cost optimisation algorithm has also been developed to find the lowest cost combination of solutions that can address constraints that have arisen on a network. This is based on a cost function that accounts for factors including disruption costs, cross-network benefits, life expectancy, enabler costs, flexibility, as well as capex and opex. Finally, it is important that these models represent the reality of the actual network planning and investment decision making processes they are representing. This is often very complex, and can be difficult to reflect in a model. Alternatively, decision-making processes may be adapted to incorporate them. © 2020, CIGRE.

In this paper, an improved decentralized Virtual-battery based droop control with the capability of bus voltage maintenance, load power dispatch and SOC balance of the energy storage system (ESS) is proposed to ensure the autonomous and stable operation of the DC microgrid. The reference output voltage and virtual resistance in the droop control loop are altered dynamically based on the Virtual-battery model of the ESS. The coordinated control among the PV-ESS-Grid integrated system is realized through the primary Bus-Signaling control, where the reference voltages at which the control modes of the PV array and the grid are switched are designed based on the VirtualOCV of the ESS. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated in MATLAB/Simulink environment with an equivalent bus capacitance-based model where the EV charging profile is obtained from real-world charging data of a fast charging station. The merits of the control strategy including higher PV utilization, less frequent connection of the grid and more precise voltage tracking are highlighted in comparison with the conventional droop control strategy.

Electric vehicles need to be recharged continually over time, and the energy required to ensure that is immense and growing. Given that existing infrastructure is insufficient to supply the projected energy needs, models are necessary to help decision makers plan for how to best expand the power grid to meet this need. A successful power grid expansion is one that enables charging stations to service the electric vehicle community. Thus, plans for power expansion need to be coordinated between the power grid and charging station investors. In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic programming approach that can be used to determine a power grid expansion plan that supports the energy needs, or load, from an uncertain set of electric vehicles geographically dispersed over a region. The first stage determines where to expand the power grid, and the second stage determines where to locate charging stations. The key link between the first and second stage decisions is that charging stations can only be located in areas with sufficient power supply enabled by an expanded power grid. To solve the model, we utilize a hybrid approach that combines Sample Average Approximation and an enhanced Progressive Hedging algorithm. We enhance the Progressive hedging algorithm by applying rolling horizon and variable fixing techniques. To validate the proposed model and gain key insights, we perform computational experiments using realistic data representing the Washington, DC area. Our computational results indicate the robustness of the proposed algorithm while providing a number of managerial insights to the decision makers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Charging station; Electric vehicles; Progressive hedging; Sample average approximation; Transportation","Approximation algorithms; Charging (batteries); Decision making; Electric power system planning; Electric vehicles; Expansion; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Transportation; Vehicles; Charging station; Computational experiment; Computational results; Electric vehicle charging; Progressive hedging; Progressive hedging algorithm; Sample average approximation; Two-stage stochastic programming; Electric power transmission networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070689550"

The flexibility of a system can be enhanced by using a smart grid comprising demand response, hybrid/diesel generation units and energy storage system. In this paper, an improved flexibility index is defined with the concept of fast reserve supply. The uncertainties of wind/solar power plants and required reserve of thermal units are considered using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). The smart grid supplies a part of load profile of commercial consumers and a part of charge profile of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) through wind and solar virtual power plants (VPPs), responsive loads, distributed generators (DGs) and the energy storage system. Moreover, the PHEVs considered in this paper provide a system with more flexibility. This paper has solved the unit commitment problem in a single-node system that has no transmission constraints. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and the mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) methods have been used in order to solve the unit commitment problem and the smart grid scheduling, respectively.

EM in a power distribution system (PDS) can reduce the system losses, operational costs and emissions, and increases system's reliability, voltage stability and efficiency. This article expands the PDS using different distributed energy resources (DERs) and observes their impacts on EM success, operational costs, system losses, and emissions. Moreover, the impacts of integrating reactive sources (RSs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and electric vehicles (EVs) on the system's operational performance is investigated. An index is defined to measure the energy management success rate (EMSR) and several case studies are created for investigating variety of system expansion options individually and collectively. Furthermore, a new reliability index, namely reliability index success rate (RISR), is defined and sensitivity analysis are presented to investigate the DERs impacts on system's voltage controllability and the defined reliability index. A new hybrid PSO-TS optimization algorithm is developed, and the well-known PGE 69-bus distribution network is selected for the simulations. Several case studies presented in the paper provide a clear understanding of the impacts of integrating different resources on the EM as well as other operational aspects of a PDS. The results reveal that the system expansion using DERs with different capacities along with EM strategies could have significant impacts on PDS performance depending on the DERs types' and capacities.

Generation scheduling is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem: (a) minimize generation production cost and (b) minimize emission costs. The focal concern is to (a) handle the scheduling of renewable energy resources against their volatilities, (b) integrating PHEVs with uncertainties related to their state of charge, and (c) stochastic load behavior over a whole week. Two heuristic-based algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem, namely Water Cycle Algorithm and Gravitational Search Algorithm The proposed scheduling approach is implemented in MATLAB R Platform, and is tested using two different microgrids sizes, 3 generator, and 10 generator unit systems integrating the effect of week days profile, renewable energy intermittency and different PHEV state of charges using the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) data.

In this paper, to manage the EVCS, first, with the aim of peak shaving, valley filling, and flattening the load curve of the network, the optimal planning of EV’s charging/discharging is devised. In this regard, after modeling involving random variables, a novel hybrid method, based on the Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) optimization algorithm and sequential Monte Carlo simulation is presented. The purpose of the presented optimal charge/discharge schedule is to control the rate and time of charging/ discharging of EVs. In the proposed model, various battery operation strategies, including Uncontrolled Charging Mode (UCM), Controlled Charging Mode (CCM), and Smart Charge/Discharge Mode (SCDM) are also considered. In the next step, in order to implement the charge/discharge schedule of the EVCS profitably, a new formulation is presented for the allocation of two EVCSs (administrative and residential EVCS). In the proposed formulation, various objective functions such as power loss reduction, reducing power purchases from the upstream network, reducing voltage deviation in buses, improving reliability is addressed. Moreover, to incentivize the owner to construct the EVCS with adopted charging/discharging schedule, the optimal profits sharing between Distribution System Operator (DSO) and EVCS owner is also performed.

The focuses were placed on analyzing the daily usage occupancy variability, daily energy consumption variability, and station-level usage variability. Compared with the traditional discrete-based analysis models, the proposed FDA modeling approach had unique advantages in preserving the smooth function behavior of the data, bringing more flexibility in the modeling process with little required assumptions or background knowledge on independent variables, as well as the capability of handling time series data with different lengths or sizes. In addition to the patterns revealed in the EV charging station’s occupancy and energy consumption, the differences between EV driver’s charging time and parking time were analyzed and called for the needs for parking regulation and enforcement. The different usage patterns observed at charging stations located on different land-use types were also analyzed. © © 2020 Chenxi Chen et al.

In this paper, we propose a quality-of-service (QoS) aware capacity planning of EVCI. In particular, the proposed framework accounts for the link between the charging QoS and the power distribution network (PDN) capability. Towards this end, we firstly optimize charging facility sizes to achieve a targeted QoS level. Then, we minimize the integration cost for the PDN by attaining the most cost-effective allocation of the energy storage systems (ESSs) and/or upgrading the PDN substation and feeders. Additionally, we capture the correlation between the occupation levels of neighboring charging facilities and the blocked PEV user behaviors. We model the EVCI as a queuing network with finite capacity, and utilize the non-stationary queuing models to study the temporal variability of the PEV charging demand.

One of the most significant impacts is the extreme load valley caused by 'consistency' in off-grid actions of EVs automatically finishing their charging, which normally occurs at night. The dramatic load reduction at limited period not only leads to security problem of power system due to the deficiency of downward reserve in generation side, but also forces the thermal units to operate in the extremely uneconomical deep peak regulation (DPR) state. To address this issue, a coordinated optimization strategy considering nighttime DPR state of units and uncertain EV demand response (DR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, unlike traditional studies, a detailed unit commitment (UC) model considering life loss and oil cost is established in this paper. After that, on the basis of elastic pricing method and day-ahead contract, price-based demand response (PDR) and incentive-based demand response (IDR) model are proposed to avoid units operating in the DPR state. The uncertainty of both IDR and PDR progress are considered as a whole in the form of opportunity constrain, and then transformed into deterministic linear constraints for solving by adopting sequence operations.

For this purpose, a unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) is applied to the power units scheduling. The optimization procedure is implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) and performs the dispatch of the thermal and hydro units, in order to minimize the operation costs. The model is applied to an entire year of operation in an hourly basis using a marginal methodology. According to the results obtained, for the scenarios considered, the EV specific CO<inf>2</inf> emissions range from 57 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km, for high wind capacity and low EV penetration, to 129 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km, for low wind capacity and low EV penetration. However, if a controlled charge strategy, aiming the minimizing of generation costs, is considered, the range of results is wider, varying from 26 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km, for high wind capacity and low EV penetration, to 133 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km for low wind capacity and low EV penetration. From the results, it can be concluded that, with the current wind capacity of the Portuguese system, and with a night charge strategy, the impact of the EV in terms of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions is not beneficial when compared to the 95 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km target, for penetrations lower than 1 million vehicles, but if a controlled charge is considered, it would be not beneficial for a EV penetration of 180 thousand vehicles. Results also show that EVs can be integrated in an environmental beneficial way, if increasing EV penetrations are combined with an increase in the installed wind capacity. © 2020, Aalborg University press.

Therefore, an accurate joint modeling approach of the arrival time, the staying time, and the charging capacity for the EVs charging behaviors in the work area based on ternary symmetric kernel density estimation (KDE) is proposed in accordance with the actual data. First and foremost, a data transformation model is established by considering the boundary bias of the symmetric KDE in order to carry out normal transformation on distribution to be estimated from all kinds of dimensions to the utmost extent. Then, a ternary symmetric KDE model and an optimum bandwidth model are established to estimate the transformed data. Moreover, an estimation evaluation model is also built to transform simulated data that are generated on a certain scale with the Monte Carlo method by means of inverse transformation, so that the fitting level of the ternary symmetric KDE model can be estimated. According to simulation results, a higher fitting level can be achieved by the ternary symmetric KDE method proposed in this paper, in comparison to the joint estimation method based on the edge KDE and the ternary t-Copula function. Moreover, data transformation can effectively eliminate the boundary effect of symmetric KDE. © 2020 by the authors.","Charging behaviors; Electric vehicles; Kernel density estimation; Optimum bandwidth","Bandwidth; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Inverse problems; Monte Carlo methods; Statistics; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging load modeling; Charging strategies; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Evaluation modeling; Inverse transformations; Kernel Density Estimation; Normal transformation; Optimum bandwidths; Metadata","Funding: This work was supported by Changzhou Sci&Tech Program (Grant No. CJ20190073) and the Talent Introduction Project of Jiangsu University of Technology (Grant No. KYY17018).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082928814"

One flexible resource is demand response (DR) of the batteries of electric vehicles (EVs). In this study, we propose an electric vehicle driving simulator using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and an EV demand response evaluation model. The former is a highly versatile EV driving simulator that can produce a random driving pattern based on actual EV fleet data, taking into account various features. The latter is a residential DR evaluation model that minimizes a household electricity bill based on the simulated fleet data and enables realistic DR operation using three processes: forecasting, planning, and operation. The contribution of this paper is to enable evaluation of realistic EV battery value in various housing and EV utilization combinations. We found that the EV battery control provides an economic benefit of US$62 (5% of the night-charging case cost) with only charge control and US$370 (31%) with charge and discharge control, as the average expected value based on our assumption of evaluation. Because 40-kWh EV batteries have a sufficiently large capacity to store surplus power from a rooftop PV, they can be operated by determining the operation schedule based on a fixed-fee structure without forecasting or planning. © 2013 IEEE.","demand response; driving simulator; Electric vehicles; Markov Chain Monte Carlo method; photovoltaic systems","Automobile simulators; Electric automobiles; Electric discharges; Electric vehicles; Housing; Markov chains; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Demand response; Demand response evaluations; Driving simulator; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Markov chain Monte Carlo method; Photovoltaic systems; Variable renewable energies; Vehicle driving simulators; Monte Carlo methods","This work was supported in part by JST CREST, Japan, under Grant JPMJCR15K4, and in part by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082293640"

By demand respone management (DRM) on and off the blockchain, based on different driving characteristics of EV subgroups, various charging–discharging demands and constraints were fully considered between EV user subgroups and agent. Purchase–sale transaction relationship and unit commitment plan were fully considered between the EV agent and power dispatching center under economic dispatching. Aiming at the lowest power purchase cost of EV users, the highest profit of EV agent and the lowest cost of power economic dispatching, smart contract models with optimal benefits were established among the three. The smart contract models were solved by combining the internal and external optimization relationship of particle swarm and genetic algorithms. The charging–discharging price was optimized by DRM to realize the reasonable allocation of charging–discharging resources of EVs. An example analysis shows that this bidding mechanism can achieve peak–cutting and valley–filling for power load. At the same time, it can effectively protect the benefits of EV users, agent, and power dispatching center. This result can provide a reference for the application of smart contract in bidding of EVs to the power grid. © 2020 by the authors.","Aggregation classification; Bidding mechanism; Blockchain; Electric vehicle; Smart contract; Unit commitment","Blockchain; Electric load dispatching; Electric vehicles; Genetic algorithms; Sales; Vehicle-to-grid; Bidding mechanism; Driving characteristics; Electric Vehicles (EVs); External optimizations; Power dispatching center; Power economics; Sale transactions; Unit-commitment; Electric power transmission networks","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51777058) and ‘Six talent peaks’ high–level project in Jiangsu province (xny–010).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077786590"

This makes them a unique test-bed that may assist researchers, businesses and policy-makers in developing a better understanding of the diverse opportunities and challenges that come with supporting electric-drive vehicle (EV) infrastructure investments that actively prioritise renewable energy sources (RES). This paper reports the findings of a Q method study that looks into the attitudes of 44 key stakeholders that have a thorough theoretical and empirical knowledge of the existing power and mobility portfolios in such islandic landscapes.

They identify the importance of integrated and clean solutions and recognise that support of pilot applications is more critical than research and development (R&D).

The issue of long-duration battery charging makes charging-station placement and design key for BEV adoption rates. This work uses genetic algorithms to identify profit-maximizing station placement and design details, with applications that reflect the costs of installing, operating, and maintaining service equipment, including land acquisition. Fast electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are placed across a congested city's network subject to stochastic demand for charging under a user-equilibrium traffic assignment. BEV users’ station choices consider endogenously determined travel times and on-site charging queues. The model allows for congested-travel and congested-station feedback into travelers’ route choices under elastic demand and BEV owners’ station choices, as well as charging price elasticity for BEV charging users. Boston-network results suggest that EVCSs should locate mostly along major highways, which may be a common finding for other metro settings. If 10% of current EV owners seek to charge en route, a user fee of $6 for a 30-min charging session is not enough for station profitability under a 5-year time horizon in this region. However, $10 per BEV charging delivers a 5-year profit of $0.82 million, and 11 cords across 3 stations are enough to accommodate a near-term charging demand in this Boston-area application. Shorter charging sessions, higher fees, and/or allowing for more cords per site also increase profits generally, everything else constant. Power-grid and station upgrades should keep pace with demand, to maximize profits over time, and avoid on-site congestion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery electric vehicles; Elastic demand; Electric vehicle charging stations; Genetic algorithm; Network equilibrium","Air quality; Battery electric vehicles; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Genetic algorithms; Profitability; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging demands; Charging station; Elastic demand; Electric vehicle charging; Network equilibrium; Stochastic demand; Traffic assignment; User equilibrium; Charging (batteries); congestion; demand elasticity; electric vehicle; electronic equipment; genetic algorithm; profitability; transportation economics; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; travel time; Boston; Massachusetts; United States","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at The University of Texas at Austin for providing super-computing capabilities towards this complex problem solution, and data storage resources.

Electric vehicles (EVs) with rechargeable batteries can be powered by external sources of electricity from the grid, and thus charging scheduling that guides low-battery EVs to charging services is significant for service quality improvement of EV drivers. The revolution of communications and data analytics driven by massive data in smart grid brings many challenges as well as chances for EV charging scheduling, and how to schedule EV charging in a smart and resilient way has inevitably become a crucial problem. Toward this end, we in this paper leverage the techniques of software defined networking and vehicular edge computing to investigate a joint problem of fast charging station selection and EV route planning. Our objective is to minimize the total overhead from users' perspective, including time and charging fares in the whole process, considering charging availability and electricity price fluctuation. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based solution is proposed to determine an optimal charging scheduling policy for low-battery EVs. Besides, in response to dynamic EV charging, we further develop a resilient EV charging strategy based on incremental update, with EV drivers' user experience being well considered. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed DRL-based solution obtains near-optimal EV charging overhead with good adaptivity, and the solution with incremental update achieves much higher computation efficiency than conventional game-theoretical method in dynamic EV charging. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","charging scheduling; deep reinforcement learning; electric vehicle; Smart grid; vehicular edge computing","Data Analytics; Deep learning; Edge computing; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Game theory; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Smart power grids; Computation efficiency; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity price fluctuation; Extensive simulations; Fast charging stations; Information and Communication Technologies; Scheduling policies; Smart grid; Charging (batteries)","Manuscript received May 27, 2019; revised August 30, 2019; accepted October 2, 2019.

Due to rising penetrations of rooftop PV, electric vehicles and demand response programs, forecasting the load of individual and a small group of households is becoming increasingly important. Forecasting the load accurately, however, is considerably more difficult when only a few households are included. A way to mitigate this challenge is to provide a set of scenarios instead of one point forecast, so an operator or utility can consider the full range of behaviors. This paper proposes a novel scenario forecasting approach for residential load using flow-based conditional generative models. Compared to existing scenario forecasting methods, our approach can generate scenarios that are not only able to infer possible future realizations of residential load from the observed historical data but also realistic enough to cover a wide range of behaviors. Particularly, the flow-based models utilize a flow of reversible transformations to maximize the value of conditional density function of future load given the past observations. In order to better capture the complex temporal dependency of the forecasted future load, we extend the structure design for the reversible transformations in flow-based conditional generative models by strengthening the coupling between the output and the conditioning input. The simulation results show the flow-based designs outperform existing methods in scenario forecasting for residential load by providing both more accurate and more diverse scenarios. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","continuous-valued side information; flow-based generative models; Residential load; scenario forecasting","Housing; Conditional density function; Demand response programs; Forecasting methods; Generative model; Power system operations and planning; Residential loads; Reversible transformation; Side information; Forecasting","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074830464"

While techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated and manifold, the ability to incorporate high resolution in space and time with long-term planning is limited. We introduce ESONE, the Spatially granular Electricity Systems Optimisation model. ESONE is a mixed-integer linear program, determining investment in power system generation and transmission infrastructure while simultaneously optimising operational schedule and optimal power flow on an hourly basis. Unique data clustering combined with model decomposition and an iterative solution procedure enable computational tractability. We showcase the capabilities of the ESONE model by applying it to the power system of Great Britain under CO<inf>2</inf> emissions reduction targets. We investigate the effects of a spatially distributed large-scale roll-out of electric vehicles (EVs). We find EV demand profiles correlate well with offshore and onshore wind power production, reducing curtailment and boosting generation. Time-of-use-tariffs for EV charging can further reduce power supply and transmission infrastructure requirements. In general, Great Britain's electricity system absorbs additional demand from ambitious deployment of EVs without substantial changes to system design. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; k-Means; MILP; Optimisation; Power systems modelling; Spatio-temporal clustering; Time-of-use-tariffs; Transmission planning","Decision making; Electric load flow; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Integer programming; Investments; Iterative methods; K-means clustering; Offshore oil well production; Vehicle transmissions; Wind power; K-means; MILP; Optimisations; Spatio-temporal clustering; Systems modelling; Time-of-use tariffs; Transmission Planning; Electric power system planning; decision making; electric vehicle; electricity; hydrological modeling; model; modeling; optimization; strategic approach; wind power; United Kingdom","We thank EPSRC and UKCCSRC for funding this work.

The limited lifetime and relatively high cost of BESSs require appropriate decisions on their installation and deployment, in order to make the best investment. This paper proposes a comprehensive method to fully support the BESS location and sizing in a low-voltage (LV) network, taking into account the characteristics of the local generation and demand connected at the network nodes, and the time-variable generation and demand patterns. The proposed procedure aims to improve the overall network conditions, by considering both technical and economic aspects. An original approach is presented to consider both the planning and scheduling of BESSs in an LV system. This approach combines the properties of metaheuristics for BESS sizing and placement with a greedy algorithm to find viable BESS scheduling in a relatively short time considering a specified time horizon, and the application of decision theory concepts to obtain the final solution. The decision theory considers various scenarios with variable energy prices, the diffusion of local renewable generation, evolution of the local demand with the integration of electric vehicles, and a number of planning alternatives selected as the solutions with top-ranked objective functions of the operational schedules in the given scenarios. The proposed approach can be applied to energy communities where the local system operator only manages the portion of the electrical grid of the community and is responsible for providing secure and affordable electricity to its consumers. © 2019 by the authors","Batteries; Decision theory; Distribution system; Planning; Scheduling; Storage","Costs; Data storage equipment; Decision theory; Economics; Energy storage; Investments; Planning; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Solar cells; Vehicle-to-grid; Voltage distribution measurement; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Comprehensive method; Distribution systems; Location and sizings; Low voltage distribution network; Objective functions; Planning and scheduling; Battery storage","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076883181"

However, electric utility support of PV generation is limited by reverse power flow into the electricity network at high penetration levels. This limits the ability to achieve Zero Net Energy (ZNE) behind individual meters and in whole communities. In parallel, district level energy systems, and Advanced Energy Communities (AEC) that include storage, offer a great prospect for integrating high levels of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into the built environment. Optimally designing such systems to serve communities, commercial, and industrial loads, while maximizing the penetration of solar PV, has been a challenge to Distribution System Operators (DSO) and city planners. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) optimization to decide the best DER portfolio, allocation, and dispatch, for an AEC that achieves ZNE and islanding while respecting electrical grid operational constraints, with a focus on distribution transformer overloads. The main strategies to avoid transformer overloads were found to be judicious sizing and siting of battery energy storage and also optimally re-distributing PV throughout the community, which increased the ability of the electric infrastructure to support a PV deployment that is 1.7 times larger than the existing transformer capacity without the need for infrastructure upgrades. This work highlights the importance of including local infrastructure capacities, such as distribution transformer constraints when developing projects that result in high renewable penetration throughout the distribution network. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage; Distributed Energy Resource Optimization; Microgrid; Mixed integer linear program; Transformer constraints; Zero Net Energy","Climate change; Digital instruments; Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Electric transformers; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Integer programming; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Battery energy storage; Distributed Energy Resources; Micro grid; Mixed integer linear program; Net energy; Transformer constraints; Battery storage; alternative energy; climate change; electric vehicle; electrical power; energy storage; equipment; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; solar power","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this work, which was provided by the California Energy Commission , contract number: EPC-15-077, and the significant leadership and contributions of Rachel Salazar, our Contract Manager.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073032936"

While until today, most programs have been involuntarily favoring households with high-income and above-average educated population groups, incentive designs are currently under review. This paper presents a spatiotemporal technology adoption model that can predict adoption behavior of residential electric vehicle (EV) chargers and photovoltaic (PV) modules up to a predefined time horizon. A set of EV and PV adoption patterns for nine incentive design combinations are compared in order to assess potential synergies that may arise under orchestrated EV and PV adoption.

This presents a big challenge for further mass roll-out of electric vehicles. To assess the impact of charging of substantial number of electric vehicles on the grid, a model of 30000 PEVs integrated with unit commitment (UCEV) was investigated in this study. The unit commitment was a large-scale, mixed-integer, nonlinear, NP-Hard (non-deterministic polynomial) optimization problem, while the integration of PEVs further increased the complexity of the model. In this paper, a global best inspired negatively correlated search (GBNCS) method which extends the evolutionary logic of negatively correlated search is proposed to tackle the UCEV problem. In the proposed algorithm, a rounding transfer function in GBNCS, is deployed to convert real-valued variables into binary ones; further, the global best information is combined in the population to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Numerical results confirmed that the proposed GBNCS can achieve good performance in both a basic IEEE 10 unit commitment problem and the UCEV problem. It was also shown that, among four charging modes, the off-peak charging mode and EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute) charging mode are more economical in PEV charging. © 2019 by the authors.","Electric vehicle; Negatively correlated search; Unit commitment","complexity; electric vehicle; integrated approach; optimization; performance assessment; transfer function","Funding: This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61773252) and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2018A030310671).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079504105"

The research underpinning this study finds that the greatest value from integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into the power grid can be generated by charging them when and where it is most beneficial for the power system, while ensuring consumers' mobility needs are met at an affordable cost. An emerging body of research on electric vehicle grid integration focuses on modeling the cost of integration under various scenarios, but few studies look at the existing promising practices that are based on policy tools in use today. The authors of this study conducted a qualitative review of policies for EV grid integration in the EU and U.S. markets. We found that, in order to unlock the environmental and economic opportunities associated with market uptake, three policy strategies are most effective: cost-reflective pricing, intelligent technology, and integrated infrastructure planning. The study also explores the implications of these practices for policymakers and regulators in the EU (A short version of this paper was presented at the 32nd Electric Vehicles Symposium in Lyon, France, in May 2019). © 2019 by the authors.","Beneficial electrification; BEV; Electric vehicle; Electricity; EV; Grid; Smart charging; Smart meter; Tariff design; Utility","Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Costs; Electric power measurement; Electric tools; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Environmental technology; Smart meters; Beneficial electrification; Grid; Smart charging; Tariff designs; Utility; Electric power transmission networks","Funding: This research was funded by European Climate Foundation.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078705118"

This model not only takes into account the influence of new CFs on the power system but also considers the impact of CF locations on traffic flow distribution and congestion level in the transportation system (TS). Yen's algorithm is innovatively employed to offer multiple possible choices for EV drivers' route selection considering CF locations determined in the traffic flow assignment model. Overall, the total cost of both distribution and TSs is minimized to obtain the optimal CF planning results. For the DS, generation cost, energy loss, and penalty cost for voltage deviation are included. For the TS, the main objective is to ensure EVs can reach their destinations at the lowest cost, while the travel time due to different path selections and the delay time caused by congestion can be minimized. Finally, a comprehensive case study on the integrated IEEE 30-bus and a 25-node TS is conducted to validate our approach. © 2015 IEEE.","Charging facility (CF); distribution system (DS) planning; electric vehicle (EV) flow; Yen's algorithm","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Energy dissipation; Genetic algorithms; Travel time; Charging facilities; Congestion level; Distribution systems; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Planning models; Traffic flow assignment; Transportation system; Voltage deviations; Traffic congestion","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council under Project PolyU252040/17E and Project PolyU152064/19E, in part by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University under Project 1-ZE7J and Project G-YBZ4, and in part by the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission under Project ITS/281/17.; Funding text 2: Manuscript received September 21, 2019; revised November 22, 2019; accepted November 29, 2019.

In the first stage, from distribution system operator's (DSO's) viewpoint, the linear DBESSs planning problem minimizes the difference between summation of its investment, degradation and charging costs and its revenue due to injecting power into the network at the discharging mode, where this problem subjects to the linear SDN optimal power flow equations and VRES, DBESS and EVs’ parking lot constraints. Noted that the bounded uncertainty–based robust model (BURM) is used to model the uncertainty of load, charging/discharging price, VRES power and EV parameters according to the uncertainty levels. In addition, the FEM strategy is applied to the SDN to obtain the suitable flexibility, security and operational indices based on the second stage problem formulation. This strategy minimizes the difference between energy cost paid to the upstream network and flexibility benefit from DSO and flexibility operator (FO) viewpoints while it considers linear AC optimal power flow and renewable and flexible sources equations as problem constraints. Moreover, in order to achieve the robust flexibility capability of EVs’ parking lot in the SDN, the uncertainty of the FEM strategy is modelled in the proposed hybrid stochastic/robust optimization. Hence, the scenario-based stochastic programming (SBSP) is used for the uncertain parameters of load, energy price and VRES power, but, BURM models the EVs uncertainty. Finally, the proposed two-stage formwork is simulated on the 19-bus LV CIGRE benchmark grid using GAMS software to investigate the capability and efficiency of the model. According to numerical results, the proposed strategy calculates the optimal location and size for DBESSs depending on the energy price, consumers and EVs demand and VRESs size in the SDN, and thus, it can obtain flexible, secure and efficient operation indices in this network based on the lowest possible cost for the investment of DBESSs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bounded uncertainty-based robust model; Distribution system operator; Flexibility operator; Flexible energy management; Hybrid stochastic/robust optimization; Renewable and flexibility sources; Robust planning; Smart distribution network","Acoustic generators; Charging (batteries); Costs; Data storage equipment; Digital instruments; Economics; Electric load flow; Energy management; Energy management systems; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Storage management; Uncertainty analysis; Distribution systems; Flexibility operator; Robust modeling; Robust planning; Smart distribution networks; Battery storage","Parts of the research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union under the Horizon2020 Framework Programme, grant agreement no. 731148 (INVADE H2020 project).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072646424"

Lots of recent research has explored numerous underlying mechanisms to achieve the synergetic interactions in the electricity balancing process. In this paper, the grid-interactive operation of electric buses is first time integrated within a dynamic market frame using the Distribution Locational Marginal Price algorithm for load congestion management. Since the defined problem correlates the opportunity charging flexibility with the bus mobility over a network, the tempo-spatial distribution of energy needs can be reflected in the dynamic of service planning. The interactions between bus operators and suppliers are quantitatively modelled by a bi-level optimisation process to represent the electric bus service planning and electricity market clearing separately. The effectiveness of the proposed load management has been demonstrated using data collected from an integrated real-world bus network. Experiments show that engagement of electric bus charging load in demand response is helpful to alleviate the network congestion and to reduce the power loss by 7.2% in the distribution network. However, alleviated charging loads have exhibited counter-intuitive capability for load shifting. The restricted electric bus operational requirements leads to a 8.17% loss of charging demand, while the reliance on large batteries has increased by 10.57%. However, the sensitivity analysis also shows that as the battery cost declines, the such discourage implications on grid-interactive electric bus operation will decrease once the battery cost below 190/kWh. The optimal grid-ebus integration have to consider the trade-off between range add-up, reduced battery cost and additional benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-level optimisation; Congestion load management; Demand response; Distribution Locational Marginal Price; Electric bus; Opportunity charging","Buses; Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric automobiles; Electric load distribution; Electric losses; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Information management; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Congestion management; Demand response; Electric bus; Interactive operations; Locational marginal prices; Operational requirements; Optimisations; Synergetic interactions; Electric power distribution; demand analysis; electric vehicle; electrical power; electricity; energy market; energy planning; management practice; market conditions; optimization; sensitivity analysis","The authors would like to thank Dr. Dong Zhang for providing the traffic data used in this paper.

This paper reports a case study of transforming an existing residential cluster in Sweden into electricity prosumers. The main energy concepts include (1) click-and-go photovoltaics (PV) panels for building integration, (2) centralized exhaust air heat pump, (3) thermal energy storage for storing excess PV electricity by using heat pump, and (4) PV electricity sharing within the building cluster for thermal/electrical demand (including electric vehicles load) on a direct-current micro grid. For the coupled PV-heat pump-thermal storage-electric vehicle system, a fitness function based on genetic algorithm is established to optimize the capacity and positions of PV modules at cluster level, with the purpose of maximizing the self-consumed electricity under a non-negative net present value during the economic lifetime. Different techno-economic key performance indicators, including the optimal PV capacity, self-sufficiency, self-consumption and levelized cost of electricity, are analysed under impacts of thermal storage integration, electric vehicle penetration and electricity sharing possibility. Results indicate that the coupled system can effectively improve the district-level PV electricity self-consumption rate to about 77% in the baseline case. The research results reveal how electric vehicle penetrations, thermal storage, and energy sharing affect PV system sizing/positions and the performance indicators, and thus help promote the PV deployment.

Driven by an urgent desire to mitigate the effects of global warming and a foreseen end to the world's fossil fuel resources, an increasing tendency toward renewable energies is fostered by the international community. On the other hand, distributed generation and electric vehicle adoption are altering load nature and profile. Therefore, energy storage (ES) becomes a necessity for its ability to bridge the gap between the dynamically changing supply and demand in addition to other ancillary services it can provide. Meanwhile, advances in smart grid technologies enable escalating the incorporation of new technologies with more efficient control schemes and energy management algorithms. This paper presents an overview on the employment of ES technologies in planning and operation of distribution systems through the literature survey.

Optimal sizing of an isolated micro-grid is challenging as it needs to satisfy the electricity demand of the customers from a long-term perspective, whilst adhering to constraints in terms of power supply reliability and system operation without losing computational tractability. This paper proposes a novel method for the optimal sizing process, subject to satisfying a reliability index for meeting the loads. The proposed method also incorporates a direct load control demand response program, and utilizes a data compression-based model reduction technique to flatten the load curve and reduce the computational effort. A conceptual micro-grid model incorporating photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, a battery bank, a DC/AC converter, and an electric vehicle parking lot is used as a test-case system to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimal sizing method. Moreover, a maiden attempt is made to investigate and confirm the effective application of the moth-flame optimization algorithm within the context of the proposed method. Accordingly, the performance of the moth-flame optimization algorithm is compared with the most preferred and up-to-date meta-heuristics employed for solving the optimal equipment capacity planning problems of renewable and sustainable energy systems, and is confirmed as superior in terms of nearing the optimal solutions. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that implementing a demand response program, by scheduling the charging of electric vehicles, together with directly controlling the domestic deferrable loads, can avoid overloading. This improves the utilization of the available components, which, in turn, reduces the size of some of the components and the life-cycle cost of the system. Hengam Island, Iran is used as a representative case study site to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of both the proposed method and the conceptualized micro-grid system. The calculated levelized cost of energy of $0.15/kWh, the discounted payback period of 10.53 years, the profitability index of 2.09%, and the internal rate of return of 11.28%, suggest that the realization of the conceptualized micro-grid on this island is not only technically feasible, but also economically viable.

However, including battery storage and other flexible resources like electric vehicles and loads with thermal inertia into a probabilistic analysis based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is challenging, because their operational profiles are determined by computationally intensive optimization. Additionally, MC analysis requires a large pool of statistically-representative demand profiles to sample from. As a result, the analysis of the network impact of PV-battery systems has attracted little attention in the existing literature. To fill these knowledge gaps, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic framework to study the impact of PV-battery systems on low-voltage distribution networks. Specifically, the framework incorporates home energy management (HEM) operational decisions within the MC time series power flow analysis. First, using available smart meter data, we use a Bayesian nonparametric model to generate statistically-representative synthetic demand and PV profiles. Second, a policy function approximation that emulates battery scheduling decisions is used to make the simulation of optimization-based HEM feasible within the MC framework. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on three representative low-voltage feeders, where the computation time to execute our MC framework is 5% of that when using explicit optimization methods in each MC sample. The assessment results show that uncoordinated battery scheduling has a limited beneficial impact, which is against the conjecture that batteries will serendipitously mitigate the technical problems induced by PV generation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Distributed energy resources; Home energy management; Monte Carlo analysis; Policy function approximation; Rooftop PV","Digital storage; Electric load flow; Energy management; Energy resources; Monte Carlo methods; Photovoltaic cells; Probability distributions; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Smart meters; Time series analysis; Voltage distribution measurement; Distributed Energy Resources; Function approximation; Home energy managements; Monte carlo analysis; Rooftop PV; Battery storage; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy resource; energy storage; equipment; management practice; Monte Carlo analysis; photovoltaic system; simulation; smart grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070319937"

Nevertheless, distribution companies (DisCos) seek to reduce the planning cost as much as possible and in this regard, demand response can be one of their effective options. However the customers participated in this program reduce or shift their consumption for the sake of increasing their benefit and accordingly DisCo must provide an incentive like the decrease in energy price which causes a competition between the DisCo and customers decisions. Because selling energy with higher price is preferable for DisCo. Hence what is proposed in this paper is the optimal probabilistic and long term planning of DGs and EV parking lots in the presence of demand response in which the mentioned competition is controlled via implementing Stackelberg game theory. In this game, DisCo plays as the leader and the customers interested in demand response play as the followers and their interaction is conducted though a decentralized distributed algorithm which finally determines the consumption profiles and the related energy selling price for all scenarios through the panning period. © 2019","Demand response; Distributed; Distribution network planning; Electric vehicle (EV); Generator (DG); Parking lot; Stackelberg","Electric vehicles; Game theory; Sales; Demand response; Distributed; Distribution network planning; Generator (DG); Parking lots; Stackelberg; Electric discharges","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070352882"

However, using 7,182 industrial and commercial US retail electric utility rates, this study dynamically simulates electrolyzer operations under different utility rate structures and shows that electrolysis units can already provide cost-competitive fuel in 20 states operating under 81 retail electricity rates. Our analysis shows that current hydrogen production costs range from US$2.6 to US$12.3 kg−1 and can be significantly reduced through flexible operation if dynamic tariffs are used. Hydrogen production costs for the 81 utility rates in 20 states are already less than US$4.0 kg−1 and competitive with the fuel cost of gasoline vehicles. Thus, under the right conditions, hydrogen fuel is already cost competitive in the US energy sector and has several interesting possible roles to play in future energy and transportation systems.; Hydrogen, which is a flexible energy carrier, has the potential to enable the accommodation of high shares of wind and solar energy sources within power systems and facilitate the integration of disparate energy sectors, e.g., electricity and transportation sectors. However, because of the high cost to implement hydrogen-based energy systems, hydrogen is usually considered as an energy carrier of the future. Indeed, hydrogen production cost calculations are often oversimplified by using annual average electricity cost by state or region, which does not allow for location-specific value assessments. This study assesses the production cost of grid-based electrolytic hydrogen across the United States and finds that hydrogen can already be cost effective today. Additionally, the value of flexible operation under dynamic electricity rates is also evaluated, and technological, policy, and regulatory advances and efforts required for widespread adoption of hydrogen technologies are discussed.; By performing the optimization of 1 MW electrolyzer over a set of ∼7,000 electric utility rates, this study evaluates the production cost of grid-based electrolytic hydrogen across the United States. We also explore the effects of flexible operation and tariff structure on the hydrogen production cost. Then, by comparing fuel costs for hydrogen, gasoline, and diesel vehicles, we find that hydrogen can already be cost competitive today.

When wind power producers (WPPs) bid in the day-ahead electricity market, how to deal with the deviation between forecasting output and actual output is one of the important topics in the design of electricity market with WPPs.

The proposed IGDT robust optimization model first transforms the deterministic hybrid system optimization scheduling model into a robust optimization model that can achieve the minimum recovery requirement within the range of wind power output fluctuation, and comprehensively considers each constraint. The results show that the wind-storage-EVs hybrid system has greater operational profits and less impact on the safe and stable operation of power grids when considering the uncertainty of wind power. In addition, the proposed method can provide corresponding robust wind power fluctuation under different expected profits of the decision-maker to the wind-storage-EVs hybrid system. © 2019 by the authors.","Electric vehicle; Information gap decision theory; Robust optimization; Uncertainty; V2G; Wind power","Commerce; Decision making; Decision theory; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Power markets; Profitability; Scheduling; Wind power; Day-ahead electricity market; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Information gap; Power fluctuations; Robust optimization; Robust optimization models; System optimizations; Uncertainty; Electric power system planning","Funding: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation under Grant 51507099.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075100368"

A locally installed home energy management system (HEMS) determines a charge schedule for the battery electric vehicle (BEV) and a charge-discharge schedule for the solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) to reduce residential customers' operation cost and to improve their overall savings. The proposed networked MGEMS strategy was implemented in IEEE 33-bus test system and evaluated under different BEV and PV-BESS penetration scenarios to study the potential impact that large amounts of BEV and PV-BESS systems can have on the distribution system and how different pricing mechanisms can mitigate these impacts.

Compared to the operation of conventional vehicles, EVs provide significantly reduced energy consumption and lower operating costs. With conventional vehicles, fuel use ties directly to the instantaneous energy consumption required to provide motive power to the wheels. Predicting the energy use can be much more complex for EVs with hybridized powertrains because the onboard vehicle systems are trying to balance the provision of power to the wheels as well as manage the state of charge (SOC) of the battery pack. Traditional modeling methodologies for estimating real-world vehicle energy consumption either depend on numerical analysis of laboratory or on-road vehicle test data or the use of full-system simulation tools. Unfortunately, full-system simulation tools suffer from scaling problems in the context of large transportation network, necessitating the development of approaches that support large transportation network projections of modal EV operations and applicable modal energy use rates (energy use for various on-road modes of operation) to predict EV energy consumption. In this study, a new modal-based approach for estimating EV energy consumption is proposed. The modal-based approach considers the variance of vehicle operating conditions and supports energy estimation for large-scale transportation networks. The Department of Energy's full-system vehicle simulation tool known as Autonomie® is used to generate energy consumption rates for specific simulations of on-road operating conditions. A sample of EV models was first developed in Autonomie® to simulate a wide range of operating conditions and generate energy use rates for selected EVs. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was then applied to the simulation output data to generate energy consumption rates under distinct on-road operating conditions, as represented by combinations of vehicle speed, acceleration rate, and battery state of charge (SOC). A large-scale regional travel demand analysis was performed for the Atlanta, GA metropolitan area, integrating a variety of EV market share scenarios. The CART-derived energy consumption rates are then applied to the model-predicted link-by-link traffic attributes to estimate fleet energy consumption. The modeling framework employs MOVES-embedded driving cycles to represent on-road operations for average speed operating conditions and random initial SOC start levels as model inputs. The model results suggest a 50% PHEV market share can achieve a 30% energy savings without significantly adding to electricity load. This modeling approach can be used to assess network-level energy use for a wide-variety of modeled transportation studies, such as evaluating transportation improvement plans, assessing the net impact on the electric grid, and forecasting the potential benefits of electrifying shared-autonomous vehicles under future scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle energy use; Large-scale transportation networks; Modal emissions modeling; Vehicle fleet energy consumption","Battery Pack; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Competition; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Forecasting; Modal analysis; Operating costs; Roads and streets; Trees (mathematics); Urban planning; Vehicle wheels; Vehicle-to-grid; Classification and regression tree analysis; Emissions model; Large-scale transportation; Sustainable transportation systems; Transportation improvement plans; Vehicle energy; Vehicle fleets; Vehicle operating conditions; Battery management systems; electric vehicle; energy use; estimation method; modeling; transportation system; travel demand","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071994336"

This study particularly focused on large-scale fast charging-station planning for e-buses in the public transportation electrification process, according to the characteristics of e-bus operation and plug-in fast charging mode. We conducted an interdisciplinary study to optimize planning jointly under the transportation system and power grid. In addition to capturing the spatiality of the e-bus charging service network, we further considered temporality in order to conduct long-term planning in view of the continuously growing e-bus charging demand. A spatial-temporal model, which determines the sites and sizes of e-bus charging stations, was proposed and the strategies for multistage infrastructure planning were put forward.

In order to design a mobile plug and play DC fast charging station, solar energy is the best and viable solution to carry out. In this paper, plug and play solar photovoltaic power plant to charge electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed and modelled using MATLAB/Simulink software. The proposed system can act as a mobile power plant. The controller allows the system to charge the battery, whenever there is abundant solar energy. Incoming EVs will be charged directly from the system battery where the charger acts as a rapid charging system.

PEV adoption increases electricity consumption from the grid that could either exacerbate electricity supply shortages or smooth demand curves. The optimal coordination and commitment of power generation units while ensuring wider access of PEVs to the grid are, therefore, important to reduce the cost and environmental pollution from thermal power generation systems, and to transition to a smarter grid. However, flexible demand side management (DSM) considering the stochastic charging behavior of PEVs adds new challenges to the complex power system optimization, and makes existing mathematical approaches ineffective. In this research, a novel parallel competitive swarm optimization algorithm is developed for solving large-scale unit commitment (UC) problems with mixed-integer variables and multiple constraints – typically found in PEV integrated grids. The parallel optimization framework combines binary and real-valued competitive swarm optimizers for solving the UC problem and demand side management of PEVs simultaneously. Numerical case studies have been conducted with multiple scales of unit numbers and various demand side management strategies of plug-in electric vehicles. The results show superior performance of proposed parallel competitive swarm optimization based method in successfully solving the proposed complex optimization problem. The flexible demand side management strategies of plug-in electric vehicles have shown large potentials in bringing considerable economic benefit. © 2019","Binary optimization; Competitive swarm optimization; Demand side management; Plug-in electric vehicles; Unit commitment","Demand side management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Integer programming; Stochastic systems; Thermal pollution; Binary optimization; Complex optimization problems; Electricity supply shortages; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Power system optimization; Swarm optimization; Swarm optimization algorithms; Unit-commitment; Plug-in electric vehicles","This research is financially supported by China NSFC ( 51607177 , 61773252 and 61876169 ); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province ( 2018A030310671 ); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2018M631005 ); European Commission’s Horizon 2020 project, “Demand Response Integration tEchnologies: unlocking the demand response potential in the distribution grid” (DRIvE, 774431); Outstanding Young Researcher Innovation Fund of Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (201822), and Shenzhen Discipline Construction Project for Urban Computing and Data Intelligence.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067923762"

The demand response opportunities associated with residential water heating as well as plug-in electric vehicles are included in order to demonstrate demand-side flexibility options. Supply-side options are based on existing and optimally deployed new-build generation technologies. The scenario based results indicate that the combination of cost reductions in wind, solar PV and stationary storage (batteries), results in economic deployment of batteries in South Africa. Battery storage complements flexibility provided by demand response and supplyside options. A notable outcome is the displacement of gas-fired turbines by batteries when assuming cost reductions for batteries in the future. Finally, despite the extensive deployment of battery storage, a significant 55 TWh of energy from solar PV and wind is curtailed. Therefore, effective sector-coupling could make extensive use of this curtailed energy in a number of ways to be identified as part of future research. © 2019 South African Institute of Electrical Engineers.

There is a substantial increase in the number of EVs due to improved energy efficiency and reduction in environmental impact as compared with internal combustion engine vehicles. The improper planning of fast charging stations (FCSs) and distributed generations (DGs) hurts the distribution system. So the distribution system operator has a significant challenge to identify the optimal location and sizing of FCSs in the distribution power network. This study presents optimal planning of FCSs and DGs with the account of the present and future increase in EV population. A multi-objective optimisation problem is formulated for optimal planning of FCSs and DGs with the objective of minimising the voltage deviation, distribution network power loss, DGs cost and the energy consumption of EV users. This problem is solved for different levels of increase in EV population for different cases. A novel hybrid shuffled frog leap-teaching and learning based optimisation algorithm is proposed and implemented to solve the considered multi-objective problem.

Herein, each distribution company (DISCO) allocates the parking lots to the electrical feeders to minimize the power loss and expected energy not supplied of the system, and consequently minimize the total cost of the planning problem over the given time horizon. In addition, the generation company (GENCO) manages the charging time of PEVs parked in the parking lots to defer the more expensive and pollutant generation units, and as a result maximize its daily profit. In both planning and operation problems, the behavioral model of PEVs' drivers are modeled with respect to the value of incentive and their distance from the parking lots. To achieve the realistic results in the planning problem of each DISCO, several economic and technical factors including yearly inflation and interest rates, hourly and daily variations of the load demand, yearly load growth of the system, and yearly growth rate of PEVs' application are considered. The optimization problems of each DISCO and GENCO are solved applying quantum-inspired simulated annealing algorithm and genetic algorithm, respectively. It is demonstrated that the behavioral model of drivers, their driving patterns, and even the type of PEVs can remarkably affect the outcomes of planning and operation problems.

Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can play a significant role in reducing the petrol consumption. A large amount of additional electrical power demand needed for the charging of PEVs may adversely affect the electric grid reliability. Using the charging station in the micro-grids (MGs) to minimise the total system operation cost in the presence of PEVs with vehicle to grid (V2G) capability is becoming vitally important. In this work, a practical model for charging strategy of PEVs based on typical charge and discharge profiles given by the battery producers is considered. The problem is constrained by the loss of load probability index of reliability. The proposed strategy makes it possible to handle the generation shortage due to the outage of conventional units and intermittency of wind turbine units. Mixed Integer Non-linear programming is used for the optimal planning of MG in the presence of PEVs. Results show that an appropriate charge and discharge strategy may lead to a significant improvement in the reliability of the considered MG as well as a reduction in the operational cost of the total system. © 2019 IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution.

To minimize future capital expenditure, improved DT design approaches are required. Therefore, a novel DT design approach based on a new paradigm of 'designing for maximum utilization' is proposed. It incorporates manufacturer and customer-sourced empirical data to achieve a desired DT retirement age and utilization rate, and allows for transient operation beyond DT nameplate rating through accurately accounting for thermal inertia. The novelty of the proposed approach derives from not only a new notion of designing for maximum utilization, but also allowing for the fact that winding insulation may not be the most critical factor affecting a DT's lifetime. Using the proposed approach, DT capital expenditure and utilization constraints can be optimized at a planning stage.

With increasing sales of electric vehicles (EV), the availability of used electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) is on the rise, which has received significant attention in recent years. The retired EVBs, after repurposing, can serve as an alternative option to new batteries in a BESS. In addition, when a microgrid operator desires to install a BESS, the optimal decisions such as installation year, energy and power size, replacement year, and the number of cycles to failure, that are normally overlooked, have to be determined. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive and novel framework for planning and operation of the BESS based on repurposed EVBs. A novel linearized BESS sizing model is proposed that obtains the BESS optimal decisions regarding design and operation. Various new, modified, and linearized relationships for the BESS have been included in the planning model to ensure that the replacement year of the BESS is optimally determined. Several classes of EVs with multiple drive cycles are clustered and integrated within the proposed framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Degradation; isolated microgrid; optimal planning; repurposed electric vehicle battery (REVB)","Degradation; Electric vehicles; Linearization; Battery energy storage systems; Design and operations; Electric vehicle batteries; Micro grid; Number of cycles to failure; Optimal decisions; Optimal planning; Planning models; Secondary batteries","Manuscript received March 14, 2018; revised September 10, 2018 and December 7, 2018; accepted January 2, 2019.

However, the substantial charging load brings challenging issues to the power grid. Modern technological advances and the huge number of high-rise buildings have promoted the development of distributed energy resources, such as building integrated/mounted wind turbines. The issue to coordinate EV charging with locally generated wind power of buildings can potentially reduce the impacts of EV charging demand on the power grid. As a result, this paper investigates this important problem and three contributions are made. First, the real-time scheduling of EV charging is addressed in a centralized framework based on the ideas of model predictive control, which incorporates the volatile wind power supply of buildings and the random daily driving cycles of EVs among different buildings. Second, an EV-based decentralized charging algorithm (EBDC) is developed to overcome the difficulties due to: 1) the possible lack of global information regarding the charging requirements of all EVs and 2) the computational burden with the increasing number of EVs. Third, we prove that the EBDC method can converge to the optimal solution of the centralized problem over each planning horizon. Moreover, the performance of the EBDC method is assessed through numeric comparisons with an optimal and two heuristic charging strategies (i.e., myopic and greedy). The results demonstrate that the EBDC method can achieve a satisfactory performance in improving the scalability and the balance between the EV charging demand and wind power supply of buildings. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the challenging problem due to the substantial charging load of electric vehicles (EVs) on the power grid. Nowadays, modern technological advances and the rapid increase of high-rise buildings have promoted the development of building integrated/mounted wind turbines. As the EVs are usually parked in buildings for a large proportion of time every day, the issue to best utilize locally generated wind power of buildings to suffice EV travelling requirements shows vital significance in reducing their dependence on the power grid. However, there exist two main challenges including: 1) the multiple uncertainties regarding the uncertain wind power generation and the random driving behaviors of EVs and 2) the scalability of the solution method. To tackle the first challenge, the idea of model predictive control is introduced to make charging decisions at each stage based on a short-term prediction of the on-site wind power and the current collection of EVs parked there. To consider the scalability and overcome the lack of global charging information of all EVs in practical deployment, an iterative EV-based decentralized charging algorithm (EBDC) is derived, in which each EV can dynamically update its own charging decisions according to a dynamic charging 'price' announced by the buildings. Alternatively, the buildings dynamically adjust the charging 'price' to motivate the EVs to get charged during the time periods with sufficient wind power supply. Numeric results demonstrate that the EBDC method is scalable and performs well in improving the balance between the EV charging demand and the wind power supply of buildings. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Building integrated/mounted wind power; decentralized charging algorithm; electric vehicles (EVs); model predictive control (MPC)","Buildings; Charging (batteries); Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Model predictive control; Optimization; Planning; Predictive control systems; Scalability; Tall buildings; Wind power; Wind turbines; Building integrated; Charging algorithm; Distributed Energy Resources; Economic and environmental benefits; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Real - time scheduling; Technological advances; Electric power transmission networks","Manuscript received May 5, 2018; accepted July 8, 2018.

One of the objectives is to minimise overall investment cost considering operational waiting cost of shared EV charging service and power loss, while the other aims to maximise the utilisation of charging infrastructures. To overcome the difficulties in solving the multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear problem, Tchebycheff decomposition based evolutionary algorithm is modified to find the Pareto front showing the trade-offs between goals above. Besides, stochastic traffic assignment model is used to obtain traffic distribution and travel demand. The final optimal solution is decided by the fuzzy satisficing method.

When multiple EVs are directly managed or controlled by price, as a cluster they will act as a VPP. This work proposes a price-based VPP with a two-class EV-charging tariff while managing the charging impact on the distribution network. Similar to a generating unit, EVs that participate through a day-ahead schedule will be charged differently than EVs that do not participate in day-ahead scheduling. The objective of this work is to maximise benefits to both the DSO and the consumer. To achieve mutual benefits, in addition to power system constraints, this work incorporates the impact of consumer dissatisfaction due to delayed charging. This is achieved by modelling dissatisfaction as a function of anxiety. This work proposes an unplanned charging unit cost to ensure that both consumer welfare and DSO welfare are jointly accomplished.

For large-scale integration of PEVs, appropriate siting and sizing of PEV charging stations are essential. In this paper, a framework for simultaneous fast charging stations (FCSs) planning and distribution network reconfiguration is proposed. The distribution network reconfiguration is effectively used to optimize objective functions. The objective function considered is defined as the sum of the initial investment and energy loss costs subject to different distribution system constraints. In the model, a scenario-based approach is used for taking into account uncertainties of traditional electric load, FCS load, and electricity price. To reduce the computational burden of the problem, a scenario reduction technique is utilized. A cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA) is employed to solve the problem. The FCSs locations and the network switches are coded separately, and they evolve cooperatively as two different species, i.e., the location species and the switch species. Furthermore, an efficient technique called Dijkstra's algorithm is used to calculate FCSs sizes in which the nearest FCS to PEVs is determined based on their driving distance from FCSs on their path to their destination.

Big-data should be handled for accurate modeling of PEVs load demand. Therefore, the utilization of data mining tools will be helpful for PEVs data analytics and clustering. In this paper, a Factor Analysis (FA) based method is introduced for the PEVs data mining. The load profiles of PEVs that are extracted by Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) are clustered in some groups optimally using FA method. The clustered data is applied on Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) and Distributed Generation (DGs) planning procedure, separately. The simulation results show the power demand of PEVs effect on both ESSs and DGs planning, however, the temporal feature of PEVs profiles affects only on ESS planning, but not considerably on DG planning. This temporal feature, here called Storage to Storage (S2S) effect, reflects the nature of PEVs and ESS long-term memory which is discussed in this paper. The simulation results show that the optimal ESSs capacity is reduced if the PEVs data are clustered especially in high PEVs penetration. However, the optimal capacities of DGs is the same with and without PEVs data clustering scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Data mining; Distributed generation; Energy storage systems; Factor analysis; Plug-in electric vehicles","Clustering algorithms; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Distributed power generation; Electric automobiles; Energy storage; Factor analysis; Monte Carlo methods; Multivariant analysis; Plug-in electric vehicles; Active distribution networks; Data-mining tools; Distributed generations (DGs); Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Factor analysis method; Planning procedure; Power system studies; Data mining; data mining; electric vehicle; energy storage; factor analysis; modeling; numerical method; simulation; temperature effect","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063588925"

Accordingly, more and more EV owners tend to make their charging decisions depending on the guidance from navigation systems, which to some extent transforms the EV charging demands into spatially dispatchable resources in the operation of distribution systems. To involve this spatially dispatchable characteristic at the planning stage of distribution systems, and deploy power devices in a cost-effective way, a comprehensive optimization model concerning the joint planning of distributed generators (DGs) and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) is proposed in this paper from the perspective of a social planner. The proposed joint planning model is embedded with the spatial scheduling problem of EV charging demands, and focuses on the optimum of relevant social costs. To relieve the complexity of the optimization model, an exact second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation is utilized to transform the proposed model into the type of mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP), which can be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Finally, a practical urban area coupled with the 33-bus distribution system is used as the test system to implement the proposed approach, and the corresponding allocation schemes as well as annualized social costs are minutely presented.

Both the electric and hydrogen vehicles are charged at the same time. They appear as two electrical and hydrogen load demand on the charging station and the charging station is powered by solar panels. The output power of solar system is separated into two parts. On part of solar power is used to supply the electrical load demand (to charge the electric vehicles) and rest runs water electrolyzer and it will be converted to the hydrogen. The hydrogen is stored and it supplies the hydrogen load demand (to charge the hydrogen-burning vehicles). The uncertainty of parameters (solar energy, consumed power by electrical vehicles, and consumed power by hydrogen vehicles) is included and modeled. The fuel cell is added to the charging station to deal with such uncertainty. The fuel cell runs on hydrogen and produces electrical energy to supply electrical loading under uncertainties. The diesel generator is also added to the charging station as a supplementary generation. The problem is modeled as stochastic optimization programming and minimizes the investment and operational costs of solar and diesel systems. The introduced planning finds optimal rated powers of solar system and diesel generator, operation pattern for diesel generator and fuel cell, and the stored hydrogen. The results confirm that the cost of changing station is covered by investment cost of solar system (95%), operational cost of diesel generator (4.5%), and investment cost of diesel generator (0.5%).

In recent years, the boost of internal combustion engine (ICE) based vehicles leads to the fossil fuel shortage and environmental pollution, bringing significant contributions to the greenhouse gas emissions. One of the effective ways to solve problems is to use electric vehicles (EVs) to replace the ICE based vehicles. However, the mass rollout of EVs may cause severe problems to the power system due to the huge charging power and stochastic charging behaviors of the EVs drivers. The accurate model of EV charging load forecasting is, therefore, an emerging topic. In this paper, four featured deep learning approaches are employed and compared in forecasting the EVs charging load from the charging station perspective.

The convergent and complex nature of a smart grid and the multifarious connection between its individual technology components, as well as competition between private companies, which will exert substantial influences on the future smart grid business, make a strategic approach necessary from the beginning of research and development (R & D) planning with collaborations among various research groups and from national, industry, company, and detailed technological levels. However, the strategic, technological, business environmental, and regulatory barriers between various stakeholders with collaborative or sometimes conflictive interests need to be clarified for a breakthrough in the smart grid field. A strategic R & D planning process was developed in this study to accomplish the complicated tasks, which comprises five steps: (i) background research of smart grid industry; (ii) selection of R & D target; (iii) societal, technological, economical, environmental, and political (STEEP) analysis to obtain a macro-level perspective and insight for achieving the selected R & D target; (iv) patent analysis to explore capabilities of the R & D target and to select the entry direction for smart grid industry; and, (v) nine windows and scenario planning analyses to develop a method and process in establishing a future strategic R & D plan. This R & D planning process was further applied to the case of a Korean company holding technological capabilities in the sustainable smart grid domain, as well as in the sustainable electric vehicle charging system, a global consumer market of smart grid. Four plausible scenarios were produced by varying key change agents for the results of this process, such as technology and growth rates, policies and government subsidies, and system standards of the smart grid charging system: Scenario 1, 'The Stabilized Settlement of the Smart Grid Industry'; Scenario 2, 'The Short-lived Blue Ocean of the Smart Grid Industry'; Scenario 3, 'The Questionable Market of the Smart Grid'; and, Scenario 4, 'The Stalemate of the Smart Grid Industry'. The R & D plan suggestions were arranged for each scenario and detailed ways to cope with dissonant situations were also implied for the company. In sum, in this case study, a future strategic R & D plan was suggested in regard to the electric vehicle charging technology business, which includes smart grid communication system, battery charging duration, service infrastructure, public charge station system, platform and module, wireless charging, data management system, and electric system solution. The strategic R & D planning process of this study can be applicable in various technologies and business fields, because of no inherent dependency on particular subject, like electric vehicle charging technology based on smart grid. © 2019 by the authors.","Electric vehicle charging technology; Patent analysis; R & D planning; R & D strategy; Scenario planning; STEEP analysis; Sustainable smart grid technology","data management; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy storage; equipment component; information and communication technology; planning process; research and development; scenario analysis; smart grid; sustainability; technological development","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (Grant No. NRF-2016R1A2B4008381).; Funding text 2: The authors appreciate the financial support from the NRF allowing for this research to","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067131712"

Integrating charging facilities, especially high-power chargers in fast charging stations, into power distribution systems remarkably alters the traditional load flow pattern, and thus imposes great challenges on the operation of distribution network in which controllable resources are rare. On the other hand, provided with appropriate incentives, the energy storage capability of electric vehicle offers a unique opportunity to facilitate the integration of distributed wind and solar power generation into power distribution system. The above trends call for thorough investigation and research on the interdependence between transportation system and power distribution system. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on this line of research. The basic models of transportation system and power distribution system are introduced, especially the user equilibrium model, which describes the vehicular flow on each road segment and is not familiar to the readers in power system community. The modelling of interdependence across the two systems is highlighted. Taking into account such interdependence, applications ranging from long-term planning to short-term operation are reviewed with emphasis on comparing the description of traffic-power interdependence.

In the literature, several models and designs were presented to address different aspects of energy trading markets, yet there is a gap between these models and their application in real-life. This paper describes a novel discrete-timely double-sided auction model that facilitates energy trading between prosumers in near real-time and forward markets. Since the practical realization of the model represents a crucial criterion for this model, the market is designed with fast clearing mechanism and simple bidding rules that guarantee the benefits of the prosumers, their privacy, and consider their personal preferences. Additionally, a decentralized home energy management approach is followed at the prosumer level to maximize the system reliability and enable an easy integration of multiple devices from different manufacturers. Hence, a device-oriented bidding strategy is demonstrated that considers the physical characteristics and technical limitations of each device type such as electric vehicles (EV), micro-combined heat and power systems (micro-CHP) or heat pumps. Furthermore, an open-source day-ahead probabilistic forecast for the photovoltaic systems (PV) is integrated with a bidding scheme that maximizes the prosumers commitment in the forward market. In the results, field measurements and testbeds data are used to quantify the benefits of the market model to the utility and the prosumers based on different metrics such as self-sufficiency, self-consumption, peak load and CO<inf>2</inf> emission reduction, and total costs. The results indicate that the market model can increase self-sufficiency and self-consumption of a microgrid while reducing the prosumer costs on average by 23%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Co-simulation; Energy management systems; Energy market; Energy trading; Grid-connected; Island; Microgrid; Peer-to-peer","Cost reduction; Emission control; Energy management; Open systems; Power markets; Bidding strategy; Cosimulation; Double sided auctions; Energy markets; Energy trading; Forward market; Grid-connected; Island; Microgrid; Peer to peer; Energy management systems; cost analysis; electric vehicle; energy market; energy planning; equipment; integrated approach; island; management practice; self sufficiency; simulation; Chandipura virus","This contribution is supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie , as a part of the SINTEG project C/sells.

In EU, many islands have become sites of energy innovation, where betting on Renewable Energy Sources is a winning choice to meet their energy needs. In this framework, renewable energies play a key role for supporting the transition of small islands to an autonomous, cleaner and low-carbon energy system – in line with the overall EU Energy Union package and EU2030 goals. This study examines the suitability of using hybrid energy system comprising photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, biomass and diesel generators to meet the electricity demand of Favignana Island, to increase the penetration of renewables in the local electricity grid. Additionally, the energy scenarios simulation aimed at identifying foreseeable energy-environmentally improvements associated to the mutual merging of further energy sectors, such as transportation and heating sector. Consequently, the renewable capacity firming issues can be strongly mitigated by integrating new energy demand components.

One of these challenges is for the power optimization of ECS, which was an optimal sizing and planning problem for ECS air circulation pack, but under the MEA environment will be transformed into a complex power scheduling problem integrated with the constraints on the controllable electrical power generation and varying thermal power demands determined by the aircraft's flight profiles.

To this end, establishing a load profile model of EV charging stations accurately and reasonably is of great significance to the planning, operation and scheduling of power system. Traditional generation methods for EV load profiles rely too much on experience, and need to set up a power load probability distribution in advance. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for load profiles of EV generation using a variational automatic encoder. Firstly, an encoder composed of deep convolution networks and a decoder composed of transposed convolution networks are trained using the original load profiles. Then, the new load profiles are obtained by decoding the random number which obeys a normal distribution. The simulation results show that EV load profiles generated by the deep convolution variational auto-encoder can not only retain the temporal correlation and probability distribution nature of the original load profiles, but also have a good restorative effect on the time distribution and fluctuation nature of the original power load. © 2019 by the authors.","Data-driven; Electric vehicles; Load profiles; Variational automatic encoder","Convolution; Decoding; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy conservation; Learning systems; Normal distribution; Random number generation; Data driven; Data-driven approach; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy saving and emission reductions; Load profile modeling; Load profiles; Temporal correlations; Variational automatic encoder; Signal encoding","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067968502"

Electric vehicles (EV) become an option for internal combustion engine (IC) based on public transportation. Use of EV can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels by the internal combustion engines and can reduce air pollution as well. This paper proposes a direction of development of fast charging station for public transportation in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. The feasibility study of the fast charging station comparing with conventional type is presented in this paper. The obstacles of fast charging stations in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, the direction of development, are discussed in this paper. This paper also presents the type of EV charging, both conductive charging, and inductive charging. It also includes the DC fast charging station infrastructure. Finally, the fast charging station installation for each location is also discussed. The results show that the fast charging systems are suitable for urban installation due to the need for quick charging. The electrical power system in the area where the station installed is an essential part of the power supply, which must be capable of supporting the high-power demand of charging station and does not affect the electricity consumption of the area. It is necessary to consider that the power supply connected to a charging station requires a significant amount of electrical energy for charging. The EV charging affects voltage drop and power loss in a power distribution system, as a result, the quality of power and the stability of the power system is reduced. © 2019 GMSARN International Journal.","Electric public transportation; Electric vehicle; Fast charging station; Public charging stations","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065019008"

This paper presents optimal distributed generator (DG) sizing and location in the power system using PEVs load demand probability. The MATLAB m-file scripts and OpenDSS were applied to solve the proposed study by varying the percentage penetration level of PEVs. A genetic algorithm optimization technique was used to find the best solution of DG installation. The simulation results showed that the PEVs were directly connected to the power grid with 100 PEVs (13.84%), 200 PEVs (27.68%) and 500 PEVs (69.19%), respectively. It was found that the DG sizing also varied with 1.773 MW, 1.663 MW and 1.996 MW, respectively. While the position of the DG also changes according to the sizing of DG. The position of DG was installed at bus No.738, bus No.741 and bus No.711, respectively. Therefore, the optimal DG placement helped to improve and reduce the total line loss and total energy demand from the power grid. The grid increased the power system stability and reduced the impact from the large scale of PEV penetration. © 2019, ECTI Association.

With the increasing level of intermittent wind and solar generation replacing the conventional power plants, there is a growing trend to involve electricity consumers in the balancing activity between the generation and consumption. In this paper, a bi-level demand response scheduling framework is proposed for residential load aggregators in which the planning scope spans a diverse set of loads and activities including inflexible loads, electric vehicles, air conditioning and water heating TCLs, energy storage system, and energy and regulation service scheduling on a residential distribution feeder with relevant constraints. Novel aggregation mechanism is proposed to capture the flexibility of heterogeneous loads based on clustering concept. In particular, the aggregation model of rapidly-growing inverter-based TCLs is derived using the proposed clustering techniques. Also, participation in regulation service market is based on the performance-based compensation scheme adopted by ISOs. The presented approach is applicable to day-ahead and real-time markets with a reliably fast calculation process. The results are indicative of the accuracy and sufficiency of the derived models. © 2018","Demand Response; Electric Vehicles; Energy Storage; Flexible loads; Regulation Service; Thermostatically Controlled Loads","Air conditioning; Commerce; Demand side management; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Housing; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Conventional power plants; Demand response; Demand response scheduling; Flexible loads; Performance-based regulation; Regulation services; Residential energy demand; Thermostatically controlled loads; Vehicle-to-grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059342163"

This paper focuses on the design and sizing optimization of the entire system and delivers three main contributions. First, this paper proposes a REVB model based on the model of capacity fading of lithium battery cells, which could allow a more realistic result for the design. Second, a power management strategy is presented to regulate the energy flow, for protecting the REVB and other system components. Third, multiple objectives are considered in the optimization model, including minimizing loss of power supply, system cost, and a new indicator, namely, potential energy waste. Then, using the simulation results of a five-year working period to calculate the objective functions, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II is applied to generate the Pareto set of a case for residential usage. In further discussions, the influences of ignoring REVB's capacity fading and removing the objective of potential energy waste possibility are presented, as well as the comparison of performances between NSGA-II and MOEA/D. The results reveal that the reliability of the system is impaired if ignoring the REVB's capacity loss, and the proposed indicator is crucial for the design.

The OGS problem usually minimizes the cost of energy assuming a fixed configuration of power systems. On the other hand, the DFR problem is done assuming a predefined generation of units. However, performing these two tasks separately may lose the optimal solution. In this paper, a framework is proposed to jointly perform OGS and optimal DFR on a day-ahead time frame. The total operation cost of MG is minimized subject to diverse technical and economic constraints.

Hence, there is a need for comprehensive planning of charging infrastructure in order to prevent power failures or scenarios where there is a considerable demand-supply mismatch. Accurately predicting the realistic charging demand of EVs is an essential part of the infrastructure planning. Charging demand of EVs is influenced by several factors, such as driver behavior, location of charging stations, electricity pricing, etc. In order to implement an optimal charging infrastructure, it is important to consider all the relevant factors that influence the charging demand of EVs. Several studies have modeled and simulated the charging demands of individual and groups of EVs. However, in many cases, the models do not consider factors related to the social characteristics of EV drivers. Other studies do not emphasize on economic elements. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of the above factors on EV charging demand using a simulation model.

The purpose of this study was to investigate a double layer supervision strategy in order to ensure a flattened power load curve in a residential application. This control is mainly divided into two levels. The first consists of a demand response algorithm, which plays an important role in scheduling the operation of home appliances by moving the shiftable appliances from peak hours, when electricity prices are high, to off-peak hours when prices are low and thus contributes to improving the daily load profile. The first strategy was coupled with the emergence of Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV), which is a new electrical load that must be considered in a smart home. The second consists of a PEV power management, which aims to ensure the bi-directional power flow from the smart home to PEVs (H2V) and from the Vehicle to Home (V2H). This procedure results in monitoring the power of each PEV connected to the home to determine its power reference and thereby, enhance again the power load curve.

Firstly, an MG equipped with storage can contribute to the stability improvement at special nodes of the distribution grid where the uncertain factors (such as intermittent renewable sources and electric vehicles) exist. The DSO is thus interested in encouraging specified MGs to provide voltage stability services by creating a distribution grid service market (DGSM), where the dynamic production-price auction is used to capture the competition of the distributed MGs. Moreover, an aggregator, serving as a broker and controller for MGs, is considered to participate in the day-ahead wholesale market. A Stackelberg game is modeled accordingly to solve the price and quantity package allocation between aggregator and MGs.

This activity was organized by the IEEE PES Working Group on Modern Heuristic Optimization (WGMHO), under the IEEE PES Analytic Methods in Power Systems (AMPS) Committee. This competition builds upon other previous competitions focused on the application of optimal power flow (OPF) to tackle schedulling problems of electrical power systems. Unlike the previous competitions, the new test beds consider more factors reflecting the stochasticity associated to renewable power generation, controllable loads, and electric vehicles. Developers of different emerging algorithms were challenged to perform algorithmic improvements and tuning within a limited computing budget. To this aim, the organizers of the competition developed and provided a set of encrypted codes for problem evaluation (i.e. calculation of objective function and constraints and saving of results). The results obtained by the best performing algorithms point out the relevance of modern heuristic optimization to tackle the complexity of stochastic OPF, without resorting to problem simplifications, and within a restricted computing budget. © 2019 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

However, the unreasonable construction of charging stations causes problems such as low user satisfaction, waste of land resources, unstable power systems, and so on. Reasonable planning of the location and capacity of charging stations is of great significance to users, investors and power grids. This paper synthetically considers three indicators of user satisfaction: charging convenience, charging cost and charging time. Considering the load and charging requirements, the model of electric vehicle charging station location and volume is established, and the model based on artificial immune algorithm is used to optimize the solution. An empirical analysis was conducted based on a typical regional survey. The research results show that increasing the density of charging stations, lowering the charging price and shortening the charging time can effectively improve user satisfaction. The constructed site and capacity selection optimization solving model can scientifically guide charging station resource allocation under the constraints of the optimal user comprehensive satisfaction target, improve the capacity of scientific planning and resource allocation of regional electric vehicle charging stations, and support the large-scale promotion and application of electric vehicles. © 2019 by the authors.","Capacity optimization; Electric vehicle charging station; Fuzzy membership degree; Immune algorithm; Location; User satisfaction","Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Location; Resource allocation; Site selection; Surveys; Vehicle-to-grid; Capacity optimization; Electric vehicle charging; Fuzzy membership; Immune algorithms; User satisfaction; Charging time","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (71501071), Beijing Social Science Fund (16YJC064) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017MS059, 2018ZD14).; Funding text 2: Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), grant number 71501071 and Beijing Social Science Fund, grant number 16YJC064.The APC was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066736401"

Their evolution is, oftentimes, in a way that tightens, or creates new, interdependences.

Relying on information and communication technology (ICT) network is a prerequisite to achieving smart operation. With the anticipated high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs), increased reliance on real-time monitoring and control is a must for the power grid to handle such unprecedented levels of load/generation uncertainties.

Our focus is to assess the EVs impact on the total operating cost and the power grid adequacy to handle the extra load, by examining different charging profiles and penetration levels of EVs with the different UC models. Simulation results show that an optimized charging strategy is considerably more efficient than the random charging strategy, both in the total operating cost and the ability to integrate more EVs. The comparison between the UC models show that the most robust UC model leads to higher total operating cost, due to its more conservative methodology to tackle the stochastic nature of wind.

It is designed in such a way that the EVs are charged at a fixed price (rather than time-of-use price) without incurring economic losses to the station owner. The simulation is modeled using the single diode model (for PV) and the state of charge of Li-ion battery (for ESU and EV). The objective function of the PSO is formulated based on a financial model that comprises of the grid tariff, EV demand, and the purchasing as well as selling prices of the energy from PV and ESU. By integrating the financial model with energy management algorithm (EMA), the PSO computes the minimum number of PV modules (N<inf>pv</inf>) and ESU batteries (N<inf>bat</inf>) for a various number of vehicles and office holidays. The resiliency of the proposed system is validated under different weather conditions, EV fleet, parity levels, energy prices, and operating period. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed system is compared with the standard grid charging system. The results suggest that with the computed N<inf>pv</inf> and N<inf>bat</inf>, the charging price is decreased by approximately 16%, while the EV charging burden on the grid is reduced by 94% to 99%.

This paper conducts an interdisciplinary study on the coordinated planning strategy of EV charging stations in a coupled traffic-electric network. A comprehensive planning model is proposed, which determines the optimal expansion strategies for both TN and PDN, including sites and sizes of new charging stations, charging spots, TN lanes, and PDN lines. In TN, we use an unconstrained traffic assignment model (UTAM) to explicitly capture the steady-state distribution of traffic flows. In PDN, operating conditions are described by a linearized DistFlow. Moreover, EV charging demands and interdependency of TN and PDN are characterized by EV charging station location model. To retrieve a global optimal solution, an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming model with UTAM constraints is formulated for the coordinated planning model.

Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) are important component for energizing EVs equipped with battery charging mode. In this paper, energy loss reduction and voltage stability factor are enhanced by optimal allocation of Distributed Generation (DG) and BSS, using new Grasshopper Optimizer Algorithm (GOA). The zone based strategy with dispersed DG ensures sufficient distance among BSS's to adequately serve the motorists and enhance system performance. The operational constraints of BSS, DG and loads in each zone for 33-and 69-bus networks are considered. GOA method is compared with established and well-known techniques, namely Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Using GOA, energy losses are reduced to 82% and 92%, while loadability is increased to 13% and 19% in 33- and 69-bus systems, respectively.

These developments urge the demand for flexibility in low voltage distribution networks, on the one hand caused by the intermittency of renewable energy sources, and on the other hand by the high power demand of battery electric vehicles and heat pumps. One of the foremost ways to create flexibility is by using energy storage systems. This paper proposes a method to first optimize the siting, power and capacity rating, technology, and operation of energy storage systems based on the technical and economic value. Secondly the method can be used to make cost- and time-based network planning decisions between network upgrades and network upgrade deferral by energy storage systems. To demonstrate the proposed method, study cases are analyzed of five low voltage distribution networks with different penetrations of photovoltaics, heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. The optimal energy storage systems in the study cases are: flow batteries sited at over 50% of the cable length with a high capacity rating per euro. With the current state of energy storage system development, network upgrade deferral is up to 61% cheaper than network upgrades in the study cases. The energy storage systems can offer additional value by reducing the peak loading of the medium voltage grid which is not taken into account in this research. © 2018","Energy storage; Network upgrade deferral; Optimization; Power system planning","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052639548"

This study addresses this technical challenge and proposes a hierarchical planning solution for both sitting and sizing of PEV fast charging stations based on a temporal-SoC (state-of-charge) characterisation and modelling of PEV fast charging demand. The optimal sitting of fast charging stations is firstly determined to ensure minimising the total number of stations and meeting the PEV fast charging demand considering the constraints of transportation networks and the expected PEV remaining mileage. Then the sizing (number of chargers and waiting spaces) of fast charging station is optimised by the use of M/M/s/N queuing model, so as to maximise the expected profit of the operator.

To optimise the PEVCS locations for plug-in electric taxis (PETs), this study proposes to utilise the multi-agent system (MAS) and evidential reasoning (ER) approach. First, an MAS simulation framework for PET operation is proposed to dynamically simulate the PETs' daily operation and estimate the charging demands of PETs, where a variety of agents are built to simulate not only the operation related players but also the operational environments. To accelerate the convergence rate and provide better operational strategies for PETs, a multi-step Q(λ) learning is developed to make decisions for PET agents whether to find passengers or to charge under various situations. Moreover, a multi-objective model for optimising the location of PEVCSs is developed considering the benefits of PETs and the power grid. Finally, an ER approach is applied to determine the final optimal siting considering the uncertainties of the assessor's cognition. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed MAS simulation framework and ER approach can effectively optimise the PEVCS locations. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.","","Location; Multi agent systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Convergence rates; Evidential reasoning approaches; Multi-objective modeling; Operational efficiencies; Operational environments; Operational strategies; Optimal locations; Public electric vehicle; Electric power transmission networks","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51377058), the Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program (No. 201001N0104744201) and the State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51437006)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056457491"

Many uncertainties concerning, e.g. the evolution of conventional loads, renewable production and electric vehicles (EVs) make it difficult to predict the location of the distribution network's weaknesses (overvoltages, undervoltages and overcurrents) and their occurrence. In some cases, alternative solutions such as demand response (DR) and reconfiguration can remove the constraints and prevent expensive network investment. This study proposes a two-stage algorithm that is able to give the probability that no technical constraints will appear as a function of the reinforcement cost with and without using DR and/or reconfiguration.

The cost of reinforcement per line and per hour of constraints enables selection of the feeders, where DR (solved with linear programming) and/or reconfiguration (exhaustive research) will be implemented in the second stage of the algorithm to remove these constraints.

We also provide a detailed analysis of uncertainties resulting from vehicle-to-grid (V2G), the most flexible charging option. Since the integration of renewable energy sources requires flexibility, we compare V2G with two competing systemic flexibility options provided by highly flexible power plants and resulting from EU high voltage grid expansion, respectively. In all cases we find that V2G has by far the most significant impact on prices, mainly smoothing them, while reducing, for example, the surplus electricity from renewable energy sources. V2G also has the strongest influence on prices compared to the systemic flexibility options of more flexible power plants or network expansion. In addition, we show that it is important to take the structural difference between working days and weekends into account. Especially on weekend days, which are usually characterized by low power demand, V2G raises power prices the most.

Real-life examples of highly renewable and sustainable island energy systems can be found all over the World. Islands on small geographic proximity provide the potential for the development of 100% renewable island energy systems by exploiting their grid interconnections. This paper proposes that interconnections of a group of islands can be used to integrate the production from locally available renewable energy sources. Besides interconnection, electric vehicles were used as a demand response technology to provide storage for electrical energy from variable sources. Electric vehicles were connected to the grid using smart charging systems (vehicle-to-grid). In addition, stationary batteries were explored in sub-scenarios for the year 2035. This enabled to analyse the influence of the battery location through two main different scenarios, i.e. one big central battery and several smaller distributed batteries. Scenarios with different integration dynamic of variable renewable energy sources and electrical vehicles were modelled with EnergyPLAN model, while the interconnection analysis was carried out with the MultiNode tool expansion. The results showed that the interconnections increased the share of energy from renewable energy sources in the final energy consumption and declined the total critical excess electricity production, while vehicle to grid technology enabled exploitation of synergies between sectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","EnergyPLAN; Interconnection; MultiNode; Renewable energy sources; Sustainable island systems","Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Integrated circuit interconnects; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Electricity production; EnergyPLAN; Grid interconnections; Integration of renewable energies; Interconnection; MultiNode; Renewable energy source; Variable renewable energies; Electric power system interconnection; alternative energy; demand-side management; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy use; island state; simulation; storage structure; sustainable development","Financial support from the PRISMI project (reference number 1099 ), co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund's programme Interreg MED is gratefully acknowledged.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053142580"

This paper demonstrates the fast heuristic method based on priority list to solve the stochastic unit commitment problem and applied it to a basic 10-unit case study system accompaniment with an electric vehicle parking lot, a wind farm and a solar farm over a 24-h time horizon. As it is reported, scenario generation with Monte Carlo simulation can relatively compensate for the intermittent behavior of renewable energy sources and result in more economical and robust planning. Moreover, the integration of plug-in electric vehicles and their controlled charging/discharging is considered.

Therefore, a modified nested energy management method is proposed to preserve privacy and run the microgrid system in a distributed manner for plug-and-play operation. Furthermore, the system resilience is enhanced against energy deficiency by reserving more in the energy storage system.

However, installation of parking lots (PLs) in order to supply PEVs causes some financial and technical challenges for electric distribution networks. The changes in system reliability, power loss, voltage drop, and costs associated with the installation of PLs are considered as some of the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, optimal placing and sizing of PEV PLs including different levels of charging stations ((CS); slow, medium, and fast) are presented in this paper. Since PLs have the potential to exchange electricity by electric network, they can be taken into account as distributed generations (DGs) and their installation can be considered from the perspective of installation of DGs. An objective function including system reliability, power loss, voltage drop, and PL cost/revenue is proposed for the optimal planning. Results: Genetic algorithm is employed to solve the optimisation problem. Simulation is carried out on a 33-bus radial distribution network. For the planning purposes of PLs, three different levels of CSs (slow, medium, and fast) in PLs are considered. The effect of increasing the penetration of PEVs in PLs is also examined on planning the PLs. The effect of different dispatch times on the selection of different CS levels (slow, medium, and fast) is investigated as well. Furthermore, the effect of applying tariffs and incentives for the customers is analysed for the selection of CS levels. Finally, the effect and importance of combinations of the CSs with different levels are investigated. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","charging stations; electric distribution networks; optimal planning; Parking lots","Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric power distribution; Genetic algorithms; Planning; Plug-in electric vehicles; Reliability; Charging station; Distributed generations (DGs); Optimal planning; Optimisation problems; Parking lots; Plugin electric vehicle (PEVs); Radial distribution networks; Technical challenges; Electric network parameters","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021808859"

The main feature is divided into three layers; the first layer is the power system level and operation, the second layer is the sensor and the communication devices, which collect the data, and the third layer is the microprocessor or the machine, which controls the whole operation. This hierarchy is working from the third layer towards first layer and vice versa. This paper introduces an eco unit commitment study, that scheduling both conventional power plants (three IEEE) thermal plants) as a dispatchable distributed generators, with renewable energy resources (wind, solar) as a stochastic distributed generating units; and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), which can be contributed either loads or generators relied on the charging timetable in a trustworthy unit commitment.

The extra loads for charging massive PHEVs could compromise the power system reliability and impose considerable stress on the power system. Transmission line congestions and generation capacity inadequacy could be caused under this circumstance. However, there is little literature which comprehensively studies the impact of large-scale PHEVs on the bulk power system reliability when smart grid technologies are incorporated including smart charging and flexible transmission topology control technologies. This work studies the impacts of different charging strategies and transmission network operation strategies on the bulk power system reliability with high PHEVs integration. An evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the charging load of PHEVs and shave the peak load. A network topology optimization (NTO) operation strategy is employed to lessen the transmission congestions and reduce the load curtailment. Based on the sequential Monte Carlo simulation method, these technologies are integrated into the reliability evaluation process. Numerical studies and sensitivity analysis are conducted on modified IEEE RTS-79 systems. The results verify the effectiveness of the technologies to realize the potential of existing power system infrastructures so as to relieve the stress caused by the PHEVs load, increase the available penetration of PHEVs and promote the bulk power system reliability which is meaningful for power system planning and risk management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Charging strategy; Evolution strategy particle swarm optimization; Network topology optimization; Plug-in electric vehicles; Power system reliability","Charging (batteries); Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Plug-in electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Reliability; Risk management; Sensitivity analysis; Topology; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging strategies; Environmental pollutions; Evolution strategies; Network topology optimizations; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Power system reliability; Sequential Monte Carlo simulation; Transmission network operation; Electric power system control","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51377178 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048418740"

Simulation results of the presented model indicate EV charging impact on a low-voltage electricity grid. Even though most of the battery charging load is spread evenly during desired times (e.g. off-peak load during night), power constraints of the EV model result in narrow peak loads. Plug-in EVs bring additional load to the electricity grid. If not managed properly, high EV deployment may lead to unnecessary grid investments due to highpeak currents of EV charging.

To facilitate large-scale EV applications, optimal locating and sizing of charging stations have become essential. For the investors of a charging station, economic benefit is the primary and the only objective. In this context, this work studies the siting and sizing of EV stations based on the optimal economic benefit. Benefit changes with time, location and capacity. A planning model method considering net present value (NPV) and life cycle cost (LCC) is proposed to determine the site and the size of the charging stations. The model has integrated distribution network constraint, the user constraint and the traffic flow captured constraint. Origin-destination lines and voronoi diagram are selected to calculate the traffic flow and the service region of each charging station, respectively. The quantum genetic algorithm was adopted for a better convergence of the planning model. Finally, a coupled 33-node distribution system and a 36-node transportation system are used to simulate various scenarios in the coupled networks of grid and transportation. The simulation results show that by introducing a planning model method considering NPV and LCC, the charging station economical benefits can be further improved. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.","","Charging (batteries); Economic and social effects; Electric power system economics; Electric vehicles; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Traffic control; Vehicle-to-grid; Distribution systems; Economical benefits; Electric vehicle charging; Life cycle costs (LCC); Optimal economic benefits; Origin destination; Quantum genetic algorithm; Transportation system; Electric power transmission networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053631457"

By curtailing wind power, the forecast uncertainty and short-term variations in wind power can be mitigated so that a lower spinning reserve is sufficient to maintain the operational security of a power system. Additionally, the electric vehicle (EV) charging load can relieve the oversupply of wind power generation and avoid uneconomical wind power curtailments. This paper presents a stochastic generation scheduling method to ensure the operation security against wind power variation as well as against forecast uncertainty considering the stochastic EV charging load. In the paper, the short-term variations of wind power that are mitigated by the wind curtailment are investigated, and incorporated into a generation scheduling problem as the mixed-integer program (MIP) forms.

Solutions based on fast-response energy storage can be costly, especially when dealing with higher renewable energy penetration rate. The rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) also brings challenges to the system planning, dispatching and operation. Due to the random dynamic nature of electric vehicle charging and routing, electric vehicle load can be challenging to the power distribution operators and utilities. The bright side is that the load of EV charging is shiftable and can be leveraged to reduce the variability of renewable energy by consuming it locally. In this paper, we proposed a real-time system that incorporates the concepts of prioritization and cryptocurrency, named SMERCOIN, to incentivize electric vehicle users to collectively charge with a renewable energy-friendly schedule. The system implements a ranking scheme by giving charging priority to users with a better renewable energy usage history. By incorporating a blockchain-based cryptocurrency component, the system can incentivize user with monetary and non-monetary means in a flat-rate system. The effectiveness of the system mechanism has been verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. The system experiment has been implemented on campus of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for 15 months and the results show that the usage of solar energy has increased significantly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Electric Vehicle (EV); Incentives; Renewable energy; Smart grid","Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Block-chain; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging; Incentive; Incentive systems; Prioritization; Real- time; Renewable energies; Renewable energy incentives; Smart grid; Blockchain; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy resource; energy storage; experimental study; incentive; installation; operations technology; prioritization; real time; smart grid; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States","This work has been sponsored in part by grants from the California Energy Commission (CEC) entitled “Demonstration of PEV Smart Charging and Storage Supporting Grid Operational Needs”.

In this paper, a decomposed planning model for optimal transition to electric vehicle in the deep decarbonization pathway project considering electricity grid constraints is developed. A bi-level charging/discharging control for plug-in electric vehicles is proposed to increase the penetration of electric vehicles in a planning horizon. Moreover, an integrated model of electricity and transportation sectors is developed in to investigate the impact of autonomous electric vehicles as a clean disruptive technology for electric vehicles. The proposed planning model is able to determine whether the existing and future electricity grid infrastructure can meet the growing electrified transportation load in the near future or not. Hence, a Bayesian decision-based conjoint method for developing a heterogeneous transportation demand model is applied. The proposed planning model is carried out on Ontario's grid and a six-bus test system to corroborate the capability of the proposed planning model. According to the obtained results in Ontario's grid, penetration of plug-in electric vehicles is increased to 30% by 2025 while the total CO<inf>2</inf> emission is decreased by 28% compared to the case with no electric vehicle charging/discharging management and disruptive technology. © 2018","Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs); Deep decarbonization pathway project (DDPP); Disruptive technology; PEV planning; Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)","Autonomous vehicles; Decarbonization; Electric automobiles; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Motor transportation; Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs); Charging/discharging; Deep decarbonization pathway project (DDPP); Disruptive technology; Electric vehicle charging; Pollution mitigation; Transportation demand; Transportation sector; Plug-in electric vehicles; carbon emission; control system; electric vehicle; electricity; emission control; energy planning; environmental technology; pollution control; smart grid; Canada; Ontario [Canada]","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048962995"

We formulate a two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the sites and sizes of: 1) PEV charging stations and 2) PV power plants.

The formulation results in a mixed-integer second-order cone program. We then design a generalized Benders decomposition algorithm to efficiently solve it. Numerical experiments show that investing in distributed PV power plants with PEV charging stations has multiple benefits, e.g., reducing social costs, promoting renewable power integration, and alleviating power congestion. The benefits become more prominent when utilizing PV generation with reactive power control, which can also help to enhance power supply quality. © 2015 IEEE.","Benders decomposition; charging station; electric vehicle; photovoltaic (PV) generation; second-order cone programming (SOCP)","Charging (batteries); Electric current distribution; Electric load flow; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Photovoltaic cells; Plug-in electric vehicles; Probability distributions; Quality control; Quality of service; Reactive power; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Benders decomposition; Charging station; Generalized benders decompositions; Plugin electric vehicle (PEVs); PV generation; Quality of Service constraints; Second-order cone programming; Two-stage stochastic programming; Power control","Manuscript received February 8, 2018; revised May 3, 2018; accepted June 7, 2018.

An economic emission analysis of the proposed SMOUC problem with the SGTs is carried out to minimize the total expected operation cost and emission using a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method. A two-stage stochastic programming method is used for dealing with the uncertain nature of power generation from the renewable DGs. Lexicographic optimization in combination with hybrid augmented-weighted ε-constraint method are employed to obtain Pareto optimal solutions of the SMOUC problem, and a fuzzy decision making is applied to select the most preferred non-dominated solution. Besides, mathematical modeling of responsive loads can help the independent system operator (ISO) to use a conservative and reliable model to have lower error in load curve characteristic estimation, such as variation in peak load. In this regard, this paper also contributes to the existing body of knowledge by developing linear and nonlinear economic models of price responsive loads for time-based DRPs (TBDRPs), as well as voluntary and mandatory incentive-based DRPs (IBDRPs) based on the customer's behavior (CB) concept and price ratio (PR) parameter. Also, new mathematical indices are proposed to choose the most conservative and reliable economic model of price responsive loads. Moreover, different widely used DRPs are analyzed and prioritized using the strategy success index (SSI) from the ISO viewpoint to determine the most effective DRP which has more coordination with the SGTs. The proposed MILP-based SMOUC problem with integrated SGTs, is applied to IEEE 10-unit test system and is implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) environment.

The paper presents a mixed integer linear programming optimization algorithm for determining the optimal size of the distributed generation unit and battery storage system based on operational savings and investment costs, as well as estimation of environmental benefits. The flexibility of the analyzed power node comes not only from its capability to store electricity in the battery banks but to optimally schedule flexible loads such as electric vehicles (EVs). Stochasticity of EV arrival and their state of charge are modeled daily and seasonally. The results show that active market signal-driven integration of such nodes is still not feasible without incentives.

While traditional approaches of assigning conventional generation units to maintain system stability can increase operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, or give signals for new investments, utilizing intelligent control of distributed sources might mitigate those negative effects. This can be achieved by controllable charging of domestic electric vehicles. On the other hand, increasing number of public charging stations gives final users the opportunity to fast charge, making their vehicles an additional source of uncertainty rather than a provider of flexibility. This paper brings a full system assessment of combined effect of slow home charging of electric vehicles together with fast charging stations (both with and without integrated energy storage systems), cast as mixed integer linear programming unit commitment model. The contributions of this paper look into optimal periods when fast charging is beneficial for the system operation, as well as assess the benefits of integrating battery storage into fast charging stations to mitigate the negative effects to power system operation. © 2018 IEEE.","Ancillary services; Battery storage system; Electric vehicles (EVs); Fast charging stations (FCS); Power system flexibility; Reserve provision","Battery storage; Electric machine control; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Investments; Mathematical models; Nickel; Partial discharges; System stability; Wind power; Ancillary service; Battery storage system; Charging station; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Fast charging stations; Power system flexibilities; Power system stability; reserve provision; Charging (batteries)","Manuscript received September 23, 2016; revised March 7, 2017 and May 16, 2017; accepted July 8, 2017.

Today, renewable energy sources, due to the lack of environmental pollution, and consequently a very low marginal cost, have been receiving considerable attention in power systems. The correct management of the unit commitment (UC) is a controversial and important issue in the power production unit, which requires suitable scheduled hours to obtain a minimum cost. This study was conducted to investigate the presence of electric vehicles and photovoltaic sources in UC and their impact to reduce production costs and improve load profiles. To achieve the optimum solution, a meta-heuristic Cuckoo search algorithm with high convergence speed is used to solve the UC problem. An IEEE 10-unit test system is employed to investigate the impacts of PEVs and PV on generation scheduling. Since the PV system is associated with uncertainty, in this study, the Uncertainty problem has been modeled using an iterative algorithm randomly with the allocation of density functions that fits the solar radiation. So, the used stochastic Monte Carlo optimization algorithm is capable of handling uncertain outputs of solar power. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing production costs and improving load profiles. © 2018 Author(s).","","Cost reduction; Electric automobiles; Iterative methods; Optimization; Scheduling; Solar energy; Stochastic systems; Cuckoo search algorithms; Environmental pollutions; Generation scheduling; Monte Carlo optimization; Photovoltaic sources; Power production unit; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty problems; Problem solving","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050792988"

All system uncertainties are modeled by fuzzy number approach. Bi-objective optimization model is proposed for the maximum benefit of DSMO and private investor in the planning horizon. To tackle the optimization problem, ε-constraint and fuzzy decision making methods are jointly used. Different scenarios are modeled including and excluding electric vehicles (EVs) charging impact on the daily load curve. The problem is formulated in the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) environment and solved by its embedded high-performance solvers. The obtained results reveal that the desired benefits of a private investor cannot be satisfied in the no benefit sharing scenario. In non-zero benefit sharing scenario, Pareto optimal front includes non-negative values for both DSMO and private investor which demonstrates the beneficial solutions. Followed by adding EVs charging load to the daily load curve, the total benefits of private investor and DSMO are reduced up to 13.33% and 30.44%, respectively.

Furthermore, price-based DR programs and incentive-based DR programs are used for operational scheduling. To achieve this aim, a techno-economic formulation is developed in which the SDISCO acts as the owner of RERs and PLs.

Along with increasing expectations related to power quality from customers, and as new types of loads emerge, such as electric vehicles, local (renewable) energy generation, and stationary and mobile energy storage, it is critical to develop new methods for DSM. In this paper, we first construct a more efficient and reliable communication infrastructure in smart grid based on cognitive radio technology, which is an essential component for enabling DSM. Then, we propose a distributed energy storage planning approach based on game algorithm in DSM, which helps users select the appropriate size of storage units for balancing the cost in the planning period and during its use. Since planning problems may lead to consumer discomfort, we propose a cost function consisting of the billing, generation costs, and discomfort costs to balance users' preferences with the payment. Furthermore, a game theory-based distributed energy management scheme is developed in DSM without leaking user privacy, which is used as inner optimization in our proposed distributed energy storage planning approach. In this energy management scheme, Nash equilibrium is obtained with minimum information exchange using proximal decomposition algorithm. Simulation results show superior performance of our proposed DSM mechanism in reducing the peak-to-average ratio, total cost, user's daily payment, and energy consumption in smart grid communication networks. © 2018 IEEE.","Demand side management; energy management; energy scheduling; game theory; green; smart gird","Cognitive radio; Cost functions; Costs; Demand side management; Domestic appliances; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Game theory; Planning; Scheduling; Storage management; Games; Green; Peak to average power ratio; Smart girds; Smart grid; Smart power grids","Funding text 1: Manuscript received October 15, 2016; revised May 13, 2017, August 23, 2017, and December 15, 2017; accepted January 20, 2018.

The fast charging station (FCS) is an example of a powerful nonlinear load that is currently being widely promoted with the aim of supporting the continuous usage of electric vehicles (EV). The most common and cheapest method to minimize harmonic impact is through the use of a passive filter. This paper presents an optimal sizing and placement of a passive filter design based on the numbers of FCS installed in the distribution system. The MATLAB/m-file platform is used to model the power system harmonic flow, passive filter, and FCS. The control strategy used to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) due to the large number of FCS is presented based on the selection of optimal location and the size of passive filters that will provide minimum THD and apparent power losses to the overall distribution system. A Modified Lightning Search Algorithm (MLSA) technique is applied with the aim of identifying the optimal solution. The Pareto-Fuzzy technique is used to obtain a better solution among nondominated solutions. From the result, the optimal placements and sizes of passive filter will be able to reduce the maximum THD and also the total losses in the distribution system, which is equipped with 17 FCS units. This study is useful as a guide for grid owners to control the impact of large-scale FCS deployment in the distribution system. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The proposed power system consists of smart houses, renewable energy plants and conventional thermal units. The transmission constraints are considered for the proposed system. The generated power of the large capacity renewable energy plant leads to the violated transmission constraints in the thermal unit commitment programme, therefore, the transmission constraint should be considered. This paper focuses on the optimal operation of the thermal units incorporated with controllable loads such as Electrical Vehicle and Heat Pump water heater of the smart houses.

However, electromechanical actuation raises specific issues when being used for safety-critical aerospace applications like flight controls: huge reflected inertia to load, jamming-type failure, and increase of backlash with service due to wear and local dissipation of heat losses for thermal balance. This study proposes an incremental approach for virtual prototyping of EMAs. It is driven by a model-based system engineering process in order to enable simulation-aided design. Best practices supported by Bond graph formalism are suggested to develop a model's structure efficiently and to make the model ready for use (or extension) by addressing the above mentioned issues. Physical effects are progressively introduced, and the realism of lumped-parameter models is increased step-by-step. In particular, multi-level component models are architected to ensure continuity between engineering activities. The models are implemented in the AMESim simulation environment, and simulation responses are given to illustrate how they can be used for preliminary sizing, control design, thermal balance verification, and faults to failure analysis.

A frequency analysis of the most coded V2G responses favours an update of the electricity market regulation – in particular in relation to electricity taxation and aggregator markets – and support for pilot projects. However, the analysis overall implies that V2G, in contrast to EVs, is a technology for the market and by the market. One that will develop on its own over time. More in-depth, our analysis shows the debates around V2G and how its perspective differs per country, pending available frequency capacity and flexible production (hydro power).

The study was carried out using a generation planning model combined with a unit commitment and economic dispatch model. The results from the planning model show a strong shift away from combined cycle gas turbines to open cycle gas turbines and gas engines as the share of wind power and solar photovoltaic increases. Demand side flexibility measures pushed this trend further. The results from the unit commitment and economic dispatch model demonstrate that the flexibility measures decrease the ramping frequency of thermal units, while the ramp rates of thermal units remain largely unchanged or increased. This indicates that the flexibility measures can cover smaller ramps in the net load more cost-effectively but that thermal power plants are still valuable for larger ramps. Impacts on emissions and electricity prices are also explored.","","Combined cycle power plants; Economic analysis; Gas turbines; Heat storage; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Thermoelectric power plants; Wind power; Combined cycle gas turbine; Flexibility measures; Generation planning; Open cycle gas turbines; Solar photovoltaics; Thermal power generation; Thermal power plants; Variable generations; Electric load dispatching","This work has been supported by Tekes through CLIC Innovation Ltd research program FLEXe; and by the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland, project “Transition to a resource efficient and climate neutral electricity system” (EL-TRAN; grant number 293437).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045526519"

The model is composed of two layers. In the upper layer, considering spatial and temporal distribution characteristics, a bi-level economic dispatch model based on traditional unit commitment for EV aggregators is established. Then, on the account of the priority considering the convenience of EV users, the lower layer proposes the charging and discharging scheduling model for aggregators. In this layer, an evaluation index system is established by analyzing the impact of EVs' declared information, which includes the declared capacity and charging duration of EVs, the sincerity degree, and the battery loss, to determine the priority of scheduling for each EV based on the entropy method. Finally, the simulation is carried out on a four-bus micro-grid system. It shows that the hierarchical dispatch model could not only obtain the dispatch plan for aggregators but also divide the strategy results of regional power grid to each EV, to determine the optimal scheduling plan for charging and discharging of the EV aggregator in each period. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

However, the use of EVs for V2G reactive power compensation increases the second-order harmonic ripple current component at the DC-side of the charger. For single-phase, single-stage EV chargers, the ripple current component has to be supplied by the EV battery, unless a ripple compensation method is employed. Additionally, continuous usage of EV chargers for reactive power compensation, when the EV battery is not charging from the grid, exposes the EV battery to these undesirable ripple current components for a longer period and discharges the battery due to power conversion losses. This paper presents a way to provide V2G reactive power compensation through a boost inverter-based single stage EV charger and a DC-side capacitor without adversely affecting the EV battery. The operation of the boost inverter-based EV charger with second-order harmonic and switching frequency ripple current reduction, the dynamic behavior of the system, the transition between different operating modes, the DC-side capacitor voltage control above a minimum allowed voltage, and the DC-side capacitor sizing are extensively analyzed. The performance of the proposed system is verified using an experimental prototype, and presented results demonstrate the ability of the system to provide V2G reactive power compensation both with and without the EV battery. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Electric vehicle (EV) charger; reactive power; second-order harmonic ripple current; vehicle to grid (V2G)","Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Harmonic analysis; Reactive power; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Capacitor voltage control; Compensation method; Experimental prototype; Reactive power compensation; Ripple currents; Switching frequency ripple; Unity power factor; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Charging (batteries)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040796717"

A decomposed Newton-Raphson (DNR) method is applied to solve the set of nonlinear power equations described in polar form. Unlike conventional Newton-Raphson-based methods, the proposed DNR algorithm does not involve calculating the lower and upper triangular matrix (LU) factorization, Gaussian elimination, and inversion of the full bus admittance matrix or Jacobian matrix and building the bus impedance matrix; it also requires less computation time and has high robustness with respect to the X/R ratio and load changes. The mathematical component models, such as three-phase conductors, transformers, automatic voltage regulators (AVRs), ZIP load demands, shunt capacitors/reactors, inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicle (EV) demands can easily be integrated into the proposed algorithm by using the injected current technique. Therefore, a three-phase power-flow problem can be decomposed into three single-phase power-flow problems with individual phase representation. To validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, four three-phase IEEE test systems and a practical Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) distribution system are used for comparisons. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm has good potential for improving the computational efficiency of optimal planning and design and also real-time power dispatch applications, even for ill-conditioned distribution networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Decomposed Newton-Raphson algorithm; Graph theory; Injection current; Matrix decomposition; Three-phase power-flow","Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Electric load dispatching; Electric load flow; Electric transformer loads; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Flow graphs; Graph theory; Jacobian matrices; Newton-Raphson method; Nonlinear equations; Voltage regulators; Automatic voltage regulators; Distributed Energy Resources; Injection currents; Matrix decomposition; Newton-Raphson algorithm; Radial distribution networks; Three-phase power flow; Upper triangular matrices; Electric power distribution","This work was sponsored in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology , Taiwan, R.O.C.

Uncertainties existing in the development of future EV technology should be properly modeled to ensure the robustness of the planning scheme. The uncertainties concerned include EV development types, growth rate of load and traffic flow, and distributions of load and traffic flow in the smart grid. The existing single-stage planning model cannot fully evaluate the risks brought by all kinds of uncertainties. Given this background, the multistage CF planning problem considering uncertainties is studied in this work. First, several typical uncertainties in future smart grid with a high penetration of EVs are considered to generate development scenarios for multistage planning. Then, the well-established data envelopment analysis is utilized to evaluate the planning schemes while the novel EV expected energy not supplied cost is defined to measure the service ability of CFs. The final planning result obtained by the proposed framework will not only have good performance in the current stage but also exhibit robustness for all the considered scenarios in the future stage with respect to uncertainties. The application potential of the designed multistage planning framework is proved by an example with both the distribution network and traffic network included. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Data envelopment analysis (DEA); electric vehicle (EV); multistage charging facility (CF) planning; uncertainty","Charging (batteries); Data envelopment analysis; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Planning; Robustness (control systems); Stages; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicles; Charging facilities; Load modeling; Smart grid; State of charge; Uncertainty; Smart power grids","Manuscript received January 18, 2017; revised May 7, 2017; accepted August 3, 2017.

If this situation continues, then it will compromise grid reliability and cause problems such as system overload, voltage and frequency fluctuations, and power losses. This is especially true for densely populated areas where the grid capacity is already strained with existing old infrastructure. The objective of this research is to identify the zip-code level electricity consumption that is associated with large-scale EV adoption in New York City, one of the most densely populated areas in the United States (U.S.). We fuse the Fisher and Pry diffusion model and Rogers model within the agent-based simulation to forecast zip-code level EV diffusion and the required energy capacity to satisfy the charging demand.

The power consumption characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible and easily controllable, which will also affect the sizing of power generation system. This paper presents a methodology for the joint capacity optimization of a typical residential standalone microgrid (MG) employing RE sources, i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WTs), diesel generators (DGs), and battery energy storage system (BESS). The MG supplies a residential community load comprising of typical residential load plus electric vehicles (EVs) charging load. The realistic mathematical models of PV, WT, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load are formulated to improve the capacity optimization methodology, which involves various realistic constraints associated with the RE sources, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load. The labyrinthine optimization problem is formulated and solved innovatively to 1) minimize the cost; 2) reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; and 3) curtail dump energy. All three objectives have special significance in designing a standalone MG, for example, cost is related to the economics, GHG emissions deal with global warming, and dump energy is related to the stability and economics of the system. The optimization problem is solved for different possible combinations of PV, WT, DG, and BESS to determine the best possible combination to serve the load effectively and economically. In addition, the impact of load shifting on the sizes of distributed generators and BESS in terms of per-unit cost and GHG emissions is analyzed using the concept of controllable loads.

The proposed model helps the investor evaluate two potential options: aggregating distributed batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) or using a dedicated energy storage system (ESS). For EV aggregations in AS markets, the targeted EV fleet size, which is a function of energy tariff charged by the EV aggregator, is a key planning consideration. In the case of ESS, the physical size is the main planning consideration. Using the proposed model, the two options for maximizing the investor's long-term payoffs are analyzed and compared by assuming the same initial investment cost for both options. Accordingly, the investor's daily bidding strategy in AS markets is optimized for each case. The net present worth is used as the basis for comparing the two investment options, and sensitivity analyses are carried out to study the impact of planning and operation variables on the feasibility of the two options. Simulation results consider both options and discuss the results for providing AS to electricity markets. © 2013 IEEE.","electricity market; energy storage systems; EV aggregators; Power system planning; V2G","Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric automobiles; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Investments; Optimization; Planning; Power markets; Sensitivity analysis; Solar cells; Vehicle-to-grid; Ancillary service; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage systems; EV aggregators; Investment Options; Operation variables; Power system planning; Electric power system planning","The work of A.

This transformation is a more complex hybrid system, with dispatchable and non-dispatchable resources, and requires novel planning and design tools to ensure the security of supply in the future. This paper presents a methodology that jointly optimizes the capacities and locations of dispatchable and non-dispatchable distributed generating units and battery energy storage system employed in a stand-alone MG serving conventional residential and electric vehicle charging load. The complex dual optimization problem is solved innovatively in two sequential steps. In the first step, the capacities of solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, battery energy storage system, and diesel generator are determined without actually considering the system design itself. While in the second step, a novel and simple methodology is developed which determines the sub-optimal capacities of distributed generation units along with their actual locations in the distribution system. To determine the optimal locations of distributed generation units, we defined a novel factor, losses-voltage-factor (LVF), which ensures reduced losses and better voltage quality. The proposed methodology gives a robust design that not only results in reduced losses and better voltage quality but also have higher reliability. The proposed technique is very practical, which can easily be applied for the planning and design of the practical active distribution networks. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery energy storage; Distributed generation; Electrical vehicle; Power system planning; Renewable energy sources","Battery storage; Complex networks; Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Gas generators; Hybrid systems; Location; Optimization; Planning; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Battery energy storage systems; Distributed generation units; Electrical vehicles; Power system planning; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy technologies; Electric power system planning","This work was supported by the Deanship of Research at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals under Project RG171009.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054384232"

Thus EV and its known variants like Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid-Electric Vehicle (PHEV) possess unique rewards compared to the conventional fossil fueled vehicle. The increasing number of EVs integration with electricity network could have a significant knock on the performance and planning of a power system especially in the demand side management. The recent studies made by the National laboratory of U S Department of Energy clearly mentions the risks involved in EV integration in terms of its peak demand profile and spinning reserve profile. The work in this paper investigates the behavior of different types of EVs & its impact on the load profile in a grid connected system in terms of EV capacity, EV charging levels and EV penetration time. The charging profile thus obtained for the above different cases clearly conveys very significant and relevant information regarding its influence on the peak time demand. The peak time period is extended to late hours respective of the different charging conditions which has a definite impact of DSM. Also, an intelligent algorithm is developed to take care of the Demand Side Management (DSM) issues. For the same, the algorithm inputs the grid as well as the vehicle parameters. The uniqueness of the proposed algorithm is in its ability to avoid the communication complexities with the Independent System Operator (ISO) & aggregator.

This would directly remove the significant indeterminacy of wind power. Because the CCS is adjacent to a wind power gathering station, it could work jointly with wind farms to operate in power system as an independent enterprise. By combining the actual operational characteristics of the wind farm and the CCS, a multidimensional operating index evaluation system was created for the joint system. Based on the wind farm's known capacity, a multi-target capacity planning model was established for CCS to maximize the probability of realizing diverse indices of the system based on dependent-chance goal programming. In this model, planning and dispatching are combined to improve the feasibility of results in the operational stage. This approach takes the effects of randomness into account for wind power and battery swapping. The model was solved through combining Monte Carlo simulation and a genetic algorithm (GA) based on segmented encoding. As shown in the simulation results, the proposed model could comprehensively include factors such as initial investment, wind power price, battery life, etc., to optimize CCS capacity and to ultimately improve the operating indices of the joint system. © 2018 by the authors.","Capacity optimization; Centralized charging station; Dependent chance programming; Power system; Wind farm","Charging (batteries); Electric utilities; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Monte Carlo methods; Secondary batteries; Wind power; Capacity optimization; Charging station; Dependent-chance programming; Power System; Wind farm; Electric power system interconnection","Funding text 1: This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51477091, 51407111, 51407106).; Funding text 2: Acknowledgments: This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51477091, 51407111, 51407106).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047074415"

The planning model aims to minimize the investment and operation costs of the distribution system while maximize the annually captured traffic flow. The uncertainties of EV charging loads are modeled for three different types of charging stations. The FISK's stochastic traffic assignment model is utilized to model realistic traffic flows. And a new class of volume-delay functions, conical congestion functions, is employed to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional Bureau of Public Roads function.

Integration of PEVs into the electric power system will result in a considerable addition to electricity demand. Due to PEV mobility, this demand has a random distribution in space and time among distribution system nodes. Therefore, short term forecast of PEV charging demand is more challenging than that for conventional loads. Assessment of PEV impacts on the power system is essential to mitigate the impairments from PEV loads. Optimal planning of PEV charging infrastructure will promote the penetration rate of PEVs and minimize the negative impacts of PEVs on the electric power distribution system and transportation road network. Design of charging facilities with integrated distributed energy resources (DER) is considered a solution to alleviate strain on the grid, reduce the integration cost with the distribution network and the charging cost. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature survey on modelling of PEV charging demand, impact assessment approaches and tools, and charging infrastructure planning. Moreover, an overview on charging facility design with integrated DER is given. Some future research directions are identified. © 2017 by the authors.

One solution to overcome this limitation is to hybridize it with supercapacitors in order to boost its power performance via a power converter. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization problem over the parameters of such hybrid energy storage systems, with the aims to solve two conflicting objectives – cost and total stored energy in the hybrid energy storage system, under a set of pre-defined design constraints. An algorithm is first developed to find all feasible solutions to the problem. Two popular design examples are then tested differentiating Lithium Iron Phosphate based batteries from Lithium Manganese Oxide/Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese based batteries. A Pareto frontier is recreated for each example and an ξ-constraint method is finally adopted to choose the best member for comparison.

We propose a real-time decentralized demand-side management (RDCDSM) to adjust the real-time residential load to follow a preplanned day-ahead energy generation by the microgrid, based on predicted customers' aggregate load. A deviation from the predicted demand at the time of consumption is assumed to result in additional cost or penalty inflicted on the deviated customers. To develop our system, we formulate a game with mixed strategy which in the first phase (i.e., prediction phase) allows each customer to process the day ahead raw predicted demand to reduce the anticipated electricity cost by generating a flattened curve for its forecasted future demand. Then, in the second stage (i.e., allocation phase), customers play another game with mixed strategy to mitigate the deviation between the instantaneous real-time consumption and the day-ahead predicted one. To achieve this, customers exploit renewable energy and ESSs and decide optimal strategies for their charging/discharging, taking into account their operational constraints. RDCDSM will help the microgrid operator to better deal with uncertainties in the system through better planning its day-ahead electricity generation and purchase, thus increasing the quality of power delivery to the customer. We evaluate the performance of our method against a centralized allocation and an existing decentralized EV charge control noncooperative game method both of which rely on a day ahead demand prediction without any refinement. We run simulations with various microgrid configurations, by varying the load and generated power, and compare the outcomes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","demand forecasting; Demand-side management (DSM); electric vehicles (EVs); energy storage; game theory; home energy management system (HEMS); microgrids; mixed strategy; optimization; renewable energy sources (RESs); smart grids","Charging (batteries); Demand side management; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Forecasting; Game theory; Interactive computer systems; Natural resources; Optimization; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Smart power grids; Demand forecasting; Games; Home energy management systems; Informatics; Micro grid; Mixed strategy; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Electric power system planning","Manuscript received January 23, 2017; revised June 16, 2017; accepted September 2, 2017.

To increase the PEV penetration level with minimal negative impact, the dynamical PEV travel behaviors and charging demand need to be better understood. This paper presents a Markov-based analytical approach for modeling PEV travel behaviors and charging demand. The travel behaviors of individual PEVs are expressed mathematically through Monte Carlo simulation considering two essential factors: temporal travel purposes and state of charge (SoC). Markov model and hidden Markov model (HMM) are adopted to explicitly formulate the probabilistic correlation between multiple PEV states and SoC ranges. This modeling approach provides an efficient and generic tool for analyzing PEV travel behaviors and charging demand based on available PEV statistics. The analytical model is further adopted in the impact assessment of two PEV normal charging scheduling strategies for a range of PEV penetration levels in an IEEE 53-bus test network with field data (network parameters and realistic PEV statistics). The results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed modeling approach in network analysis considering PEV integration. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Charging demand; distribution networks; hidden Markov model (HMM); Markov model; Monte Carlo simulation; plug-in electric vehicle (PEV); state of charge (SoC)","Analytical models; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric machine control; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Plug-in electric vehicles; Solar cells; Charging demands; Informatics; Markov model; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); State of charge; Hidden Markov models","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021992239"

We show that this decision problem is equivalent to finding the shortest path on an ""extended"" transportation graph, with virtual arcs that represent charging options. Using this extended graph, we study the collective effects of a large number of EV owners individually solving this path planning problem.

The HEV power management has been well studied for decades to optimize vehicle fuel economy by properly determining the power split ratio between internal combustion engine and electric motor. Meanwhile, the HEV tailpipe emissions have also been decreased, thanks to the implementation of aftertreatment systems, of which selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems have been widely equipped in ground vehicles powered by diesel engines to reduce NO<inf>x</inf> emissions. For SCR systems, major efforts are dedicated to design the efficient ammonia dosing strategies for removing NO<inf>x</inf> without generating excessive ammonia slip at the tailpipe. By coordinately controlling the HEV power management and aftertreatment systems, it is possible to achieve lower fuel consumption and emissions from tailpipe. In addition, the proposed control strategy incorporates the preview road grade information to calculate the optimal torque–split ratio and ammonia dosing amount such that the overall performance can be improved for the trip. The road grade impacts on vehicle fuel consumption and emissions are investigated in this paper. A model-based controller with an explicit consideration of road grade has been analytically developed and verified in simulation environment. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated under US06 test cycle and comparison results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. Controller’s real-time implementation potential is also discussed in this paper. © 2017 IEEE.","Emissions; HEV power management; Road preview; SCR","Ammonia; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Controllers; Diesel engines; Electric machine control; Electric power measurement; Electric power system control; Energy management; Engines; Fuel economy; Fueling; Fuels; Ground vehicles; Highway administration; Highway planning; Information management; Internal combustion engines; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Power control; Power management; Real time control; Roads and streets; Selective catalytic reduction; Solar cells; Thyristors; Torque; Transportation; Vehicles; Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) power managements; Integrated power management; Power system management; Real-time implementations; road preview; Roads; Selective catalytic reduction systems; State of charge; Hybrid vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041691026"

Additionally, we address bi-criteria problems to consider user costs as the second objective. A convex parsimonious model that depends on relatively few assumptions and input parameters is proposed and it is shown to be useful for obtaining conceptual insights for high-level planning. In a parametric study using a hypothetical urban network model generated based on realistic parameters, we show that GHG emissions decrease with agency budget, and that the reductions vary depending on multiple factors related to EV market and EV technologies. The optimal solutions found from the bi-criteria problems are shown to be close to the solution minimizing GHG emissions only, meaning that the emission minimizing policy can also minimize user costs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Convex system; Electric vehicle public fast charging stations allocation; Greenhouse Gas Emissions minimization; Optimization; Parsimonious model; Urban grid network","Budget control; Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Optimal systems; Optimization; Charging station allocations; Convex system; Electric vehicle public fast charging station allocation; Fast charging stations; Greenhouse gas emission minimization; Greenhouse gas emissions; Grid network; Minimisation; Optimisations; Parsimonious modelling; Urban grid network; Electric vehicles; design; electric vehicle; emission control; greenhouse gas; modeling; optimization; transportation planning; urban transport","Funding for this research was provided by the NYUAD research funds of the second author.

Among many areas associated with the Internet of Things, smart grid and electric vehilces have their share of this challenge by being both producers and consumers (ie., prosumers) of big data. Electric vehicls can significantly help smart cities to become greener by reducing emissions of the transportation sector and play an important role in green smart cities. In this article, we first survey the data analytics techniques used for handling the big data of smart grid and electric vehicles. The data generated by electric vehicles come from sources that vary from sensors to trip logs. Once this vast amount of data are analyzed using big data techniques, they can be used to develop policies for siting charging stations, developing smart charging algorithms, solving energy efficiency issues, evaluating the capacity of power distribution systems to handle extra charging loads, and finally, determining the market value for the services provided by electric vehicles (i.e., vehicle-to-grid opportunities).

Generation scheduling (GS) in IMGs is affected by the stochastic behavior of electric and heat loads due to outages of production processes or production lines and the uncertainties in solar irradiance and combined heat and power systems. This paper presents a stochastic scenario-based GS framework to consider uncertainties in an IMG coordinated with PEV charging. Although the scenario-based methods are usually very time consuming, this paper shows that their applications in IMGs will not significantly increase the calculation time. The proposed formulation guaranties that occurrence of each condition of uncertainty will not affect the PEV activities. An IMG with 12 factories, photovoltaic generations, and 6 types of electric vehicles with different battery sizes is considered and simulated. The main contributions are (1) a new stochastic GS problem formulation to minimize the cost of IMGs while fully charging all PEVs within their requested periods considering the network security, factories, and PEV constraints; (2) changing the nonlinear constraints to linear forms suitable for scenario-based optimization; and (3) considering the stochastic behavior of electric loads without requiring any data about their internal process in each factory. © © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","industrial microgrid; photovoltaic generations; plug-in electric vehicles; scenario based method; stochastic generation scheduling","Automobile manufacture; Charging (batteries); Cogeneration plants; Electric lines; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Network security; Plug-in electric vehicles; Scheduling; Thermal load; Vehicles; Combined heat and power system; Distributed Energy Resources; Generation scheduling; Micro grid; Non-linear constraints; Photovoltaic generation; Scenario-based methods; Stochastic generation; Stochastic systems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027689277"

Distribution network operators (DNO) are investing in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to enable cost reduction through smart grid applications. The DNO also benefits from the additional measurement data the AMI gives for the network planning process. The availability of AMI data can be limited by the cost of communication and by privacy concerns. To determine the social welfare of an AMI, the economic gains should be estimated. For the planning of the low voltage (LV) network, a method for determining the value of an AMI still needs to be developed. Therefore, a planning methodology which allows various levels of measurement data availability has been developed. By applying this approach the value of different levels of AMI from an LV-network planning perspective can be determined. To illustrated the application of this approach a case study for the LV-network of a Dutch DNO is performed. The results show that an increase in measurement data can lead to €49-254 lower LV-network reinforcement costs. A detailed analysis of the results shows that already 50% of the possible cost reduction can be achieved if only 65% of the households have AMI data available. © 2017 The Author(s)","Advanced meter infrastructure; Distribution networks; Power system monitoring; Power system planning","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Costs; Electric power distribution; Electric power system measurement; Distribution network operators; Low voltage network; Network planning process; Planning methodology; Power system planning; Privacy concerns; Residential electricity consumption; Smart grid applications; Advanced metering infrastructures","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019869412"

In particular, this paper presents a methodology to determine the optimal resource size (e.g., the number of solar panels and the energy-storage capacity) that minimizes the charging system's investment costs, while meeting the charging system's performance metrics. A search-based algorithm is devised to solve the formulated nonlinear integer programming problem in order to efficiently explore the problem's solution space. A 3-D Markov chain model is used to account for the intermittency in solar power production. Finally, an example of a completely green charging system is presented to demonstrate the use of the proposed methodology. © 2015 IEEE.","Charging station model; completely green systems; electric vehicles (EVs); energy storage systems (ESSs); optimization; renewable energy sources (RES)","Charging (batteries); Electric power plants; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Fossil fuel power plants; Integer programming; Investments; Markov processes; Natural resources; Optimization; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging station; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage capacity; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Fossil-fueled power plants; Nonlinear integer programming problem; Renewable energy source; Search-based algorithms; Electric power transmission networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044212689"

However, low participation is always a problem of those strategies since EV users also need a charging strategy to serve their needs and interests. This paper proposes a method focusing on EV users' benefits that reduce the cost of battery capacity degradation, electricity cost, and waiting time for different situations. A cost model of battery capacity degradation under different state of charge (SOC) ranges is developed based on experimental data to estimate the cost of battery degradation. The simulation results show that the appropriate planning of the SOC range reduces 80% of the cost of battery degradation, and the queuing theory also reduces over 60% of the waiting time in the busy situations. Those works can also become a premise of charging management to increase the participation. The proposed strategy focusing on EV users' benefits would not give negative impacts on the power grid, and the grid load is also optimized by an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) in the solution space of the charging time restricted by EV users' benefits. © 2017 by the authors.","Charging management; Cost model of battery degradation; Electric vehicle; Load control; Monte Carlo; Optimal scheduling","Battery management systems; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric automobiles; Electric load management; Electric machine control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Focusing; Monte Carlo methods; Plug-in electric vehicles; Press load control; Queueing theory; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Artificial fish swarm algorithms; Battery capacity; Battery degradation; Charging managements; Charging strategies; Electricity costs; Optimal planning; Optimal scheduling; Charging (batteries)","This project is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (51677004) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (E16JB00140).

These challenges must be minimized by optimal planning based on the variable output from RES to meet the additional demand caused by EV charging. In this paper, a novel method for optimal allocation and sizing of RES and EV charging stations simultaneously and managing vehicle charging process is provided. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to obtain objective variables in order to reduce power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and demand supplying costs, and EV battery cost. In this optimization problem, the location and capacity of RES and EV charging stations are the optimization variables. Coefficients which are dependent on wind speed, solar radiation, and hourly peak demand ratio for the management of the EV charging pattern in off-peak load hours are introduced.

Results show that there is significant potential for electrification to reduce the energy demand, oil dependence, and GHG emissions of the LDV fleet, because of the high efficiency of EVs, and especially BEVs.

Modelling of PEVs (as vehicle to grid (V2G)) is highly dependent on the owner's behaviour. In this study, a systematic method based on multi-state Markov model is utilised to represent the uncertainty of V2G's presence. To investigate the impact of PEVs, a probabilistic TEP in the presence of V2Gs (P_TEPV2G) is proposed. In the proposed TEP model, the objective function consists of the total line and risk costs (RCs). Moreover, the optimal place and capacity of PEV parking lots are considered as the decision variables. It is assumed that there is an electric vehicle fleet operator for the management of electric vehicles. Because P_TEPV2G is a complex and non-linear optimisation problem, an improved cuckoo search algorithm (ICS) is utilised to effectively solve the problem. On the IEEE 24-bus system, simulation results show that the availability of the PEVs at the proper bus leads to decreasing RC and deferring construction of new transmission lines. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.","","Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Intelligent control; Markov processes; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Cuckoo search algorithms; Decision variables; Non-linear optimisation; Objective functions; Systematic method; Transmission expansion planning; Vehicle fleets; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028553671"

The Fukushima nuclear accident has complicated the position of nuclear energy in Japan's long-term power generation mix due to public acceptance and other associated issues such as nuclear waste management. There is a need for more studies concerning the peak grid integration of variable renewables such as PV and wind power, which are expected to potentially replace nuclear energy. On the power demand side, the anticipated future introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) will have an impact on grid management in the electric power system.

Concurrently, with increase in gas prices, driven by a foreseeable fossil fuel depletion in the future, developments in the automotive sector, and environmental concerns, penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing. These changes will continue to drive the distribution planning problem to evolve in the coming years. This paper presents a comprehensive long-term distribution planning framework from the perspective of local distribution companies (LDCs) considering distributed generation (DG), substations, capacitors, and feeders. Apart from considering the usual demand profile, the proposed framework considers uncontrolled and controlled (smart) PEV charging demand, as well as demand response (DR) options. Based on a back-propagation algorithm combined with cost-benefit analysis, a novel approach is proposed to determine the optimal upgrade plan, allocation, and sizing of the selected components in distribution systems, to minimize the total capital and operating cost. A new iterative method is proposed which involves post-processing the plan decisions to guarantee acceptable adequacy levels for each year of the planning horizon. The performance of the proposed framework is examined considering several case studies on the 33-bus and 69-bus test systems. It is noted from the studies that the presence of uncontrolled PEV charging loads results in much higher plan costs as compared to the case without PEVs, impacts the distribution plan significantly, and hence these loads indeed need be considered in the planning process. On the other hand, smart charging of PEVs have a much reduced impact on the plan cost, and helps alleviate some investments which were needed with uncontrolled charging PEVs. Therefore, the LDCs and policy makers need to encourage customers to adapt these options in the long-run. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Demand response; Distributed generation; Distribution planning; Local distribution company; Plug-in electric vehicles","Automotive industry; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Costs; Crashworthiness; Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Geographical distribution; Investments; Iterative methods; Plug-in electric vehicles; Smart power grids; Capital and operating costs; Demand response; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution planning; Distribution system planning; Environmental concerns; Local distributions; Long-term distribution; Cost benefit analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008641993"

In fact, the amount of primary reserve provided by EVs is highly related to the EV's charging schedules. Therefore, in this paper a smart charging algorithm is also proposed that is based on direct load control of EVs by the system operator. The proposed scheme would be applicable with the lowest intelligence level and will not impose extra investment cost to the EV owners. All the nonlinear constraints included in the primary reserve scheduling are linearized to be solvable by mixed integer linear programming method.

This study presents a methodology for possibilistic-probabilistic-based PEVs' load modelling in order to be employed in optimal wind distributed generation (WDG) planning. The proposed methodology considers not only the PEVs temporal uncertainty, but also the uncertain spatial effect of PEVs on WDGs as renewable-based distributed resources. The WDG planning is considered as an optimisation problem which is solved under technical and economic constraints. A hybrid modified particle swarm optimisation/genetic algorithm is proposed for optimisation that is more robust than the conventional algorithms.

To foster the large-scale integration of EVs, transportation electrification is becoming an emerging trend. This paper proposes a comprehensive model for the expansion planning of urban electrified transportation networks (ETNs), which determines the best investment strategies for the TN and the power distribution network (PDN) simultaneously, including the sites and sizes of new lanes, charging facilities, distribution lines, and local generators. The steady-state distribution of traffic flow in the TN is characterized by the Nesterov user equilibrium (NUE). The operating condition of the PDN is described by linearized branch power flow equations. To consider the interdependency between the TN and PDN created by the charging behavior of EVs, the power demand of on-road charging facility is assumed to be proportional to the traffic flow it carries. The expansion planning model is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with NUE constraints. In order to retrieve a global optimal solution, it is further transformed into an equivalent mixed-integer convex program through duality theory and techniques of integer algebra; no approximation error is involved. Case studies on a test ETN corroborate the proposed model and method. © 2015 IEEE.","Electric vehicle (EV); electrified transportation network (ETN); expansion planning; interdependency; Nesterov user equilibrium (NUE); power distribution network (PDN)","Convex optimization; Electric automobiles; Electric load flow; Electric network analysis; Electric power distribution; Fossil fuels; Integer programming; Investments; Nonlinear programming; Urban growth; Expansion planning; interdependency; Power distribution network; Transportation network; User equilibrium; Urban transportation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044992777"

A Markov model of a fast charging station for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, i.e., the most prevalent type today, is proposed. Li-Ion batteries present a two-step charging profile, making energy management particularly challenging. A wide range of situations is covered by considering three types of scenarios with and without waiting lines. The analytical results obtained from the steady-state solution of the Markov model reveal the behavior of multiple variables of interest: Availability of the charging station to accept new customers (in terms of space and energy), number of customers, energy consumption, and power utilization. From the results, indicators for assessing the quality of service of the charging station are derived. Based on these indicators, customers may decide either to wait or to head toward another station. The owners of the stations, in turn, can predict the impact of investments in space and energy provisioning, when devising capacity planning strategies. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","charging stations; lithium batteries; Markov processes","Crashworthiness; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy utilization; Investments; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Markov processes; Quality of service; Sales; Secondary batteries; Analytical results; Capacity planning; Charging profiles; Charging station; Energy demands; Energy provisioning; Fast charging stations; Steady state solution; Charging (batteries)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979211075"

However, it is of considerable difficulties to precisely forecast the undispatchable and intermittent wind and solar power generations. The uncoordinated charging of PEVs imposes further challenges on the unit commitment in modern grid operations. In this paper, all these factors are comprehensively investigated for the first time within a novel hybrid unit commitment framework, namely UCsRP, which considers a wide range of scenarios in renewable generations and demand side management of dispatchable PEVs load. UCsRP is however an extremely challenging optimisation problem not only due to the large scale, mixed integer and nonlinearity, but also due to the double uncertainties relating to the renewable generations and PEV charging and discharging. In this paper, a meta-heuristic solving tool is introduced for solving the UCsRP problem. A key to improve the reliability of the unit commitment is to generate a range of scenarios based on multiple distributions of renewable generations under different prediction errors and extreme predicted value conditions. This is achieved by introducing a novel multi-zone sampling method. A comprehensive study considering four different cases of unit commitment problems with various weather and season scenarios using real power system data are conducted and solved, and smart management of charging and discharging of PEVs are incorporated into the problem. Test results confirm the efficacy of the proposed framework and new solving tool for UCsRP problem. The economic effects of various scenarios are comprehensively evaluated and compared based on the average economic cost index, and several important findings are revealed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-zone sampling; Plug-in electric vehicles; Solar power; Uncertainties; Unit commitment; Wind power","Carbon; Climate change; Electric power system economics; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Information management; Optimization; Problem solving; Solar energy; Vehicles; Wind power; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Multiple distribution; Optimisation problems; Uncertainties; Unit commitment problem; Unit-commitment; Wind and solar power; Plug-in electric vehicles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84999767704"

Departing from this, this paper discusses and quantifies to what extent electric vehicles are required to be possible to shut down gas power plants. The analysis is performed using the EnergyPLAN tool, for the case study of the Portuguese power system in 2050. The results suggest that even a small share of the fleet of electric vehicles providing load balancing could lead to important reductions in gas use and energy excess. The gas share in the electricity mix is reduced from 10.2% without electric vehicles providing for stabilization to zero with 30% of the fleet providing it; the energy excess is reduced from 1.5% to zero above 15% of electric vehicles stabilizing the grid. Therefore, to achieve a power system without fossil fuels, electric vehicles capable of supporting the grid should be developed and adopted, as should be promoted the market and regulatory conditions to allow this. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; EnergyPLAN; Future energy systems; Power grid stabilization; Smart charging; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Charging (batteries); Electric power plants; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Gases; Plant shutdowns; Stabilization; Vehicle-to-grid; Energy systems; EnergyPLAN; Future energies; Future energy system; Grid stabilizations; Power grid stabilization; Power grids; Smart charging; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle-to-grid (V2G); Fossil fuels; electric vehicle; electricity; energy market; energy planning; future prospect; natural gas; power plant; renewable resource; smart grid; software; Portugal","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029820101"

This tool is illustrated by evaluating the readiness of two low-voltage networks for increasing amounts of customers with PV panels or with EV chargers. Both undervoltage and overvoltage are considered in the studies presented here. Probability distribution functions are calculated for the worst-case overvoltage and undervoltage as a function of the number of customers with PV or EV chargers. These distributions are used to obtain 90th percentile values that act as a performance index. This index is compared with an overvoltage or undervoltage limit to get the hosting capacity. General aspects of the hosting-capacity calculations (performance indices, limits, and calculation methods) are discussed for a number of other phenomena: overcurrent; fast voltage magnitude variations; voltage unbalance; harmonics and supraharmonics.

The homes in the microgrid include the essential and/or shiftable household appliances accurately modeled by the SSUEP. These homes are also equipped with the photovoltaic systems, battery energy storages and electric vehicles. The residential microgrid is assumed to be connected to a smart grid such that bi-directional exchange of electric power would be possible. Being aware of the amount of power demand for the appliances and the day-ahead prices of the energy, the consumer provides the required energy from the photovoltaic systems, battery energy storages and electric vehicles (by Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid capabilities). Moreover, using the flexibility of the shiftable loads, the consumer can be involved in the demand response strategies to reduce the costs. This flexibility is a result of delaying or anticipating the start time and the inter-phase delay modeled by the SSUEP.

With the transition; towards a sustainable energy system, the household load is changing, through the introduction of photovoltaics and electric vehicles. The tariff structures which are currently employed in the EU are either capacity and/or energy consumption based. In light of the changes in the household load the question whether these tariff structures are the most suitable merits renewed attention. In this work, the cost-reflectivity of various tariff structures has been computed based on a distribution network planning approach. Next to this, the predictability of a network tariff, i.e. how much change would a household experience in network charges in two consecutive years has also been computed to gain insight into how well users will be able to react to the tariff. The results show that a peak load based network tariffs score best on the reflectivity while having an acceptable level of predictability. The switch from an energy consumption based network tariff, which is now most often applied, towards a peak load based network tariff should therefore, be considered. © 2017 The Authors","Capacity tariffs; Cost-reflectivity; Distribution network economics; Distribution network tariff","Costs; Economics; Energy utilization; Investments; Capacity tariffs; Distribution network operators; Distribution network planning; Electricity networks; Level of predictabilities; Network investment; Sustainable energy systems; Tariff structures; Reflection; cost analysis; distribution system; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy planning; household energy; investment; prediction; tariff structure","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026394459"

SILVER optimizes the asset dispatch for a user-defined electricity system configuration that specifies demand response availability, generation assets, storage assets, and transmission infrastructure. SILVER has been applied to twelve Ontario-based scenarios to explore the implications of high VRE penetrations in a 100% renewable scenario. The role that storage, demand response, electric vehicles, and transmission expansion might play in balancing VRE is analyzed. The results highlight the operational differences between balancing options: demand response, with a fixed price remuneration, is dispatched in proportion to net load curve variability, whereas storage technologies which take advantage of price arbitrage, are dispatched in proportion to marginal cost variability. GHG emissions fall with increasing VRE penetrations; however, there are local maxima when natural gas replaces nuclear generation, which interrupt this trend. Weak wind resources in the summer necessitate significant non-VRE capacity, which increases capital costs for higher VRE penetrations. Ontario planners have a number of interdependent challenges to contend with: integrating VREs on a nuclear-dominated system, mitigating wind's significant seasonal variability, and establishing effective remuneration mechanisms to improve grid flexibility. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity dispatch model; Energy system analysis; Flexibility resources; Scenario analysis; Variable renewable energy integration","Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Silver; Vehicle transmissions; Wind power; Development and applications; Electricity system; Energy system analysis; Flexibility resources; Scenario analysis; Seasonal variability; Transmission expansion; Variable renewable energies; Electric load dispatching; cost analysis; design; emission; energy resource; greenhouse gas; numerical model; operations technology; optimization; renewable resource; scenario analysis; smart grid; wind power; Canada; Ontario [Canada]","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025077326"

The present research describes a smart grid consisting of power plants and distributed generation, fueled via photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, and augmented with electric vehicles as power storage devices. Employing a parking lot to deal with challenges such as low penetration of the electric vehicles embedded with Vehicle-to-Grid functionalities encounters two difficulties: where they should be installed, and modeling of bi-directional power flow between electric vehicles, the grid, and the distributed generation system. In this regard, a nonlinear multi-objective problem is designed and solved via employing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, and the forward and backward substitution method. In addition, Newton-Raphson Power Flow is adopted and modified to calculate the power flow of the distribution network. The results related to optimal placement and sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems show that bus 16 of the studied grid is the best place to integrate a parking lot – equipped with 117 photovoltaic and 10 wind turbine units - to the tested IEEE-26 buses. Furthermore, this study suggests that the aforementioned grid could employ a complex versatile control unit able to optimize the operating point, scheduling charging and discharging for a large number of electric vehicles while considering the technical aspects (total active power loss and voltage deviation). In this regard, a new hybrid control approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System tuned via utilizing the optimal power flow problem is proposed. The controller's superiority to handle grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid services is discussed and compared to other studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed generation; Electric vehicle; PSO-ANFIS controller; Renewable energy sources; Smart grid","Adaptive control systems; Controllers; Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric losses; Electric power plants; Electric power system control; Electric vehicles; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Natural resources; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Plug-in electric vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Vehicle-to-grid; Virtual storage; Wind turbines; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Distributed generation system; Grid to vehicle and vehicle to grids; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Optimal placement and sizings; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Electric power transmission networks; control system; distribution system; electric vehicle; energy resource; genetic algorithm; integrated approach; nonlinearity; optimization; photovoltaic system; power plant; renewable resource; smart grid; wind turbine","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021653734"

Future systems will likely incorporate higher penetrations of intermittent renewable and inflexible nuclear power. This will significantly impact on system operations, particularly the requirements for flexibility in terms of reserves and the cost of such services. This paper estimates the interrelated changes in wholesale electricity and reserve prices using two novel methods. Firstly, it simulates the short run marginal cost of generation using a unit commitment model with post-processing to achieve realistic prices. It also introduces a new reserve price model, which mimics actual operation by first calculating the day ahead schedules and then letting deviations from schedule drive reserve prices. The UK is used as a case study to compare these models with traditional methods from the literature. The model gives good agreement with and historic prices in 2015. In a 2035 scenario, increased renewables penetration reduces mean electricity prices, and leads to price spikes due to expensive plants being brought online briefly to cope with net load variations. Contrary to views previously held in literature, a renewable intensive scenario does not lead to a higher reserve price than a fossil fuel intensive scenario. Demand response technology is shown to offer sizeable economic benefits when maintaining system balance. More broadly, this framework can be used to evaluate the economics of providing reserve services by aggregating decentralised energy resources such as heat pumps, micro-CHP and electric vehicles. © 2017 The Authors","Electricity price; Low carbon power systems; MILP; Optimization; Short run marginal cost; Unit commitment","Climate change; Crashworthiness; Economics; Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Integer programming; Nuclear fuels; Optimization; Proven reserves; Electricity prices; Low carbon; MILP; Short run marginal costs; Unit-commitment; Costs; carbon; cost; demand analysis; economic analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy resource; nuclear power; optimization; price dynamics; renewable resource; scenario analysis; Chandipura virus","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019361402"

VRESs reduce the available flexibility by displacing existing flexible units due to their priority in dispatch and simultaneously enhance the need for additional flexibility due to their uncertain nature. In this light, the system is faced with a flexibility gap. One way to cover the created flexibility gap is the incorporation of emerging flexible resources into power systems operation. On this basis, this paper proposes a comprehensive flexible generation portfolio including bulk energy storages (BESs), plug-in electric vehicle parking lots (PEV PLs), and demand response (DR) programs. A stochastic market-based model is proposed to coordinate the interactions among these flexibility providers considering different sets of uncertainty, such as wind power generation and PEV owner's behavior.

This situation of ‘surplus electricity’ also exists elsewhere as there in increasing intermittent renewable power on various grids. The ability of the power to gas energy hubs to utilize the existing natural gas distribution and storage network (within the province) to distribute and store the electrolytic hydrogen produced is one of its major advantages. In this study an optimization model of a power to gas energy hub having a hydrogen production module capacity of 2 MW has been developed. The goal of the optimization study is to carry out an economic feasibility of the energy hub under existing pricing mechanisms for the three primary services that it provides, namely: 1) Offsetting CO<inf>2</inf> emissions at natural gas end users by providing hydrogen enriched natural gas; 2) Providing demand response when directed by the Independent Electricity System Operator of the province, and 3) Providing pure hydrogen to a fuel cell vehicle refueling station. It is observed that current pricing mechanisms are not valued high enough for the power to gas energy hub to be economically feasible and payback periods longer than the project lifetime (20 years) have been observed. Therefore, through a post-processing economic calculation, the additional monetary incentive required for the energy hub to achieve a NPV equal to zero for shorter project lifetimes of 8, 9 and 10 years have been calculated. The required additional monetary incentives (for the new project lifetimes) have then been split proportionally to the share of the revenues earned by the energy hub while providing each of the three services. Through this, the existing pricing mechanisms have been scaled up and a new pricing mechanism has been developed that highlights the monetary requirements of a power to gas energy hub to be economically feasible. It is seen that the required increase in the pricing of the three different services offered by the energy hub are reasonable and lie within the ranges proposed for them in coming years. © 2017","Demand response; Electrolysis; Fuel cell vehicles; GAMS; Green energy; Hydrogen production; Mixed integer non linear programming optimization; Power to gas","Costs; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electrolysis; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Integer programming; Investments; Natural gas; Nonlinear programming; Demand response; Fuel cell vehicles; GAMS; Green energy; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Power to gas; Natural gas vehicles; demand analysis; development strategy; electric vehicle; electricity supply; electrokinesis; energy conservation; energy planning; environmental management; feasibility study; fuel cell; linear programing; natural gas; optimization; power generation; price determination; transportation; valuation; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Nucleopolyhedrovirus","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017555585"

A new use case for electric vehicles, grid services, has recently begun commercial operation. Vehicles capable of such application, called Grid-Integrated Vehicles, may have use cases with charging and discharging summing up to much more energy transfer than the charging only use case, so measuring and reducing electrical losses is even more important. In this study, the authors experimentally measure and analyze the power losses of a Grid-Integrated Vehicle system, via detailed measurement of the building circuits, power feed components, and of sample electric vehicle components. Under the conditions studied, measured total one-way losses vary from 12% to 36%, so understanding loss factors is important to efficient design and use. Predominant losses occur in the power electronics used for AC-DC conversion. The electronics efficiency is lowest at low power transfer and low state-of-charge, and is lower during discharging than charging. Based on these findings, two engineering design approaches are proposed. First, optimal sizing of charging stations is analyzed. Second, a dispatch algorithm for grid services operating at highest efficiency is developed, showing 7.0% to 9.7% less losses than the simple equal dispatch algorithm. © 2017 The Authors","Dispatch algorithm; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Grid-integrated vehicles; Power losses; Vehicle-to-grid","Charging (batteries); Commercial vehicle operations; Commercial vehicles; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Electric variables measurement; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Grid computing; Rectifying circuits; Vehicle-to-grid; Commercial operation; Dispatch algorithms; Efficient designs; Electric vehicle charging; Engineering design; Integrated vehicle systems; Power-losses; Vehicle components; Electric losses; algorithm; building; electric vehicle; electronic equipment; energy budget; energy efficiency; experimental study; measurement method; operations technology","The empirical work reported in this paper was funded by a joint venture between an NRG Energy EV group and the University of Delaware; the NRG EV group is now a separate spinoff called EVgo Services, LLC.

As distinct from the existing studies, the temporal characteristics of charging loads and their reliability impacts are especially focused in our work. To achieve this, a novel dual-stage optimization framework is developed. The proposed method considers the capacity reinforcement of distribution systems in conjunction with their operation decisions and coordinates them under the same frame so as to minimize the total system costs for accommodating electric vehicles. The uncertainties associated with renewable energy generation, charging behaviors, and conventional load demand are represented by multiple probabilistic scenarios. To fully reveal the impacts of electric vehicle integration, both uncontrolled and coordinated charging schemes are considered in our analysis. Furthermore, as charging loads bring about extra demand to the grid, the reliability criteria is also taken into account in the proposed model. Using a heuristic algorithm combined with reliability analysis, the optimal solution for the concerned problem can be determined, which involves the best timing, locations, and capacities for installation of distributed generation units and network components. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is examined based on a 38-bus test system and the obtained results verify the performance of the approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chronological information; Distribution network; Dual-stage optimization; Plug-in electric vehicle; Supply adequacy; Uncertainty","Electric power distribution; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Plug-in electric vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Chronological information; Distributed generation units; Dual stage; Optimization framework; Renewable energy generation; Supply adequacy; Temporal characteristics; Uncertainty; Reliability analysis; chronology; cost analysis; distribution system; electric vehicle; heuristics; integrated approach; optimization; planning method; probability; reliability analysis; renewable resource; uncertainty analysis","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51507061) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB0101903).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015615365"

In this study, a robust flexible probabilistic programming (RFPP) method is developed for planning municipal energy system (MES) with considering peak electricity prices (PEPs) and electric vehicles (EVs), where multiple uncertainties regarded as intervals, probability distributions and flexibilities as well as their combinations can be effectively reflected. The RFPP-MES model is then applied to planning Qingdao's MES, where electrical load of 24-h time is simulated based on Monte Carlo. Results reveal that: (a) different time intervals lead to changes of energy supply patterns, the energy supply patterns would tend to the transition from self-supporting dominated (i.e. in valley hours) to outsourcing-dominated (i.e. in peak hours); (b) 15.9% of total imported electricity expense would be reduced compared to that without considering PEPs; (c) with considering EVs, the CO<inf>2</inf>emissions of Qingdao's transportation could be reduced directly and the reduction rate would be 2.5%.

In this work, we present an optimal control model for studying the economic and grid interaction benefits of smart charging of electric vehicles (EV), vehicle-to-grid, and space heating load control for residential houses with on-site photovoltaics (PV). A case study is conducted on 1–10 net zero energy houses with detailed empirical data, resulting in 8–33% yearly electricity cost savings per household with various electric vehicle and space heating system combinations. The self-consumption of PV is also significantly increased. Additional benefits through increasing the number of cooperating households are minor and saturate already at around 3–5 households. Permitting electricity transfer between the houses and EV charging stations at workplaces increases self-sufficiency significantly, but it provides limited economic benefit. The additional cost savings from vehicle-to-grid compared to smart charging are minor due to increased battery degradation, despite a significant self-sufficiency increase. If the optimization is conducted without taking the battery degradation cost into account, the added monetary value of vehicle-to-grid can even be negative due to the unmanaged degradation. Neglecting battery degradation completely leads to overestimation of the vehicle-to-grid cost benefit. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Energy management; Linear programming; Net zero energy; Photovoltaics; Space heating load control","Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Electric load management; Electric machine control; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Heating; Houses; Linear programming; Renewable energy resources; Space heating; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery degradation; Distributed renewable energy generations; Electricity pricing; Electricity transfer; Ev charging stations; Optimal control model; Photovoltaics; Zero energies; Secondary batteries; control system; cost-benefit analysis; demand-side management; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy resource; linear programing; optimization; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; residential energy; smart grid; workplace","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009159710"

The problem involves distinct types of vehicles and a community, composed of small houses, residential areas and different Renewable Energy Resources. In order to highlight possibilities for power dispatching, the optimization of three distinct goals is considered in the analysis: mini/microgrid total costs; usage of vehicles batteries; and maximum grid peak load. Sets of non-dominated solutions are obtained using a mathematical programming based heuristic (Matheuristic). By analyzing cases of study composed with up to 70 vehicles, we emphasize that PEVs and UAVs can effectively contribute for renewable energy integration into mini/microgrid systems.

The harmonic currents generated in these new environments not only substantially increase the transformer load losses, but also cause abnormal winding temperature rise and hence transformer excessive loss of life. Therefore, the harmonic contents of the loads currents should be accounted in choosing the appropriate size of distribution transformers. To address this concern of utilities, this paper introduces a new method to solve the OTS problem in such environments. It takes into account the effects of harmonics currents on excessive heat generation in a transformer and the transformer insulation loss of life due to these thermal stresses. This paper proposes a new dynamic programming (DP) framework to solve the OTS problem. Although the proposed DP method considers the transformer thermal equations, however, by introducing a novel variable named the depreciation cost, the consecutive stages of the proposed DP network are hold independent. Therefore, the proposed DP method does not require any supplementary heuristic algorithm to solve the OTS problem. In response, the proposed method is very fast and easy to implement. Comprehensive studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic programming; Harmonic current; Thermal constraint; Transformer loss evaluation; Transformer optimal sizing","Dynamic programming; Electric transformers; Electric windings; Harmonic analysis; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Hybrid vehicles; Industrial plants; Optimization; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Problem solving; Thermal insulation; Distributed generator (DGs); Dynamic programming techniques; Harmonic currents; Optimal sizing; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Smart distribution networks; Thermal constraints; Transformer loss; Electric transformer loads; algorithm; electric vehicle; harmonic analysis; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; temperature gradient; thermal power","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008220546"

High demands including power and energy density, low charge/discharge power stress on the battery (long lifetime), lightweight design, and relatively modest cost at the same time cannot be provided solely by batteries or supercapacitors. For this reason, we propose the use of a Li-ion battery/supercapacitor hybrid embedded power supply for an urban electric vehicle. The sizing process of this system including the optimization of the power sharing is done thanks to a developed hybrid Particle Swarm-Nelder-Mead algorithm involving multi-objective optimization. This approach also allows us to optimize the proposed energy management strategies based on frequency rule-based control and different ways of supercapacitors energy regulation.

The corresponding electric systems are then operated and constrained to meet the load every hour over four years. The total cost of each energy system is calculated, both with and without externalities, to find the least cost energy systems. Using today's costs of conventional and renewable electricity and without adding any externalities, the cost-minimum system includes no renewable generation, but does include EVs. When externalities are included, however, the most cost-effective to system covers 50% of the electric load with renewable energy and runs reliably without need for either new conventional generation or purpose-built storage.

The present paper develops an integrated approach to economically assess initiatives that can transform island power systems into smart ones. Single and multi-action initiatives fostering the deployment of renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESS), demand-side management (DSM), and electric vehicle (EV) are considered. An hourly unit commitment on a weekly basis is proposed to assess the impact of the initiatives on the system operation costs of five prototype island power systems, which have been identified by applying clustering techniques to a set of sixty islands power systems. The different investment costs of the initiatives are accounted for determining their corresponding internal rate of return (IRR) through their lifetime. The economic assessment of single and multi-action initiatives for five prototype islands representing sixty island power systems quantifies which initiatives are most suitable for which type of island power system. The assessment shows that islands of different sizes and features require different initiatives. Larger islands tend to DSM initiatives, whereas smaller islands tend to RES initiatives. Multi-action initiatives achieve highest system operation cost reduction, whereas single action initiatives yield to highest IRR. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Demand side management; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Renewable energy sources; Smart island; Unit commitment","Cost reduction; Demand side management; Earnings; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Investments; Natural resources; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Storage management; Clustering techniques; Demand Side Management (DSM); Energy storage systems; Internal rate of return; Island power systems; Renewable energy source; Smart island; Unit-commitment; Smart power grids; cost analysis; demand-side management; economic activity; electric vehicle; energy budget; energy resource; integrated approach; optimization; renewable resource; smart grid","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006978712"

Highlighted by an abundance of domestic natural gas and greater accessibility of electric drivetrains, alternative fuels are enhancing the financial bottom-line of organizations while improving the environment and public health. Alternative fuels are diverse and include ethanol, biodiesel, electricity, hydrogen, natural gas and propane. Each has a distinct business case that can be applied successfully. Social and environmental benefits vary and must be considered in context with regional and project-specific drivers. For example, natural gas and biodiesel can yield returns on investment for large fleets of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. For smaller fleets with a greater proportion of light- to medium-duty vehicles, propane improves performance. Electric vehicle technology is evolving rapidly and is now well suited for fleets of passenger vehicles. Businesses, private fleets, municipalities, transit authorities, airports, and federal agencies all benefit from alternative fuels. Strategies to harness the benefits include planning, design and program management.

The effectiveness of the proposed technique is tested on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system with considering the power system constraints and using genetic algorithm. This algorithm selects the optimal sites and sizes (number of electric vehicles) of these parking lots and shows the optimal results. The results of these simulations with genetic algorithm demonstrate that the economic problem of parking lots placement depends on many items such as number of the electrical vehicles (EVs) in each parking lot (capacity of parking lot), state of charge of EVs, as well as the electricity price in peak/off-peak periods. Moreover, it is suggested that the existence of parking lots, considering adequate incentives for EVs owners, has economic benefit for distribution network operators, reduces total power loss, and can improve the distribution system voltage profile. Also, the number of parking lots to be allocated in a distribution system supports the distribution system at peak load hours because it is more interesting from economic point of view to install more parking lots.

A proposed two-level approach with multi-objective optimization on the global level, was used to design a Croatian Energy System (CES), where electric vehicles (EVs) are integrated to serve as battery storage in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) mode, for a scenario between 2015 and 2050.

Improving the self-healing capability of the smart grid is referred to as healer reinforcement. In this paper, a new healer reinforcement approach is introduced, contributing PHEVs, through optimal parking lot (PL) placement and sizing, under contingencies, by considering the available control and protective devices. Moreover, the PL placement and sizing problem formulation is extended by considering PHEVs participation as both backup and storage units in the self-healing process. PHEVs contribution as backup units could provide electricity for faulted zone customers. Furthermore, demand variations during the restoration might lead to congestion occurrence in the backup feeder. Hence, the PHEVs contribution as storage units could prevent congestion occurrence and enable execution of the best restoration strategy, through charging in light load and injecting power to the backup feeding path in the peak load of repair time. In addition, the stochastic nature of PHEV owners' behavior is modeled in service restoration and the possibility of reactive power injection by PLs is considered in the service restoration process. The proposed formulation is applied to a standard test system (RBTS-4) to minimize a combined effect of the customer-based (SAIDI) and cost-based (TCR) reliability indices. The simulation is conducted to investigate the effects of physical limitations on candidate locations as well as PHEVs participation as both backup and storage units.

However, the recent tendency in support of daytime workplace charging that absorbs energy produced by solar photovoltaic (PV) panels appears to be the most promising solution to facilitating higher PV and EV penetration in the power grid. This paper studies optimal sizing of workplace charging stations considering probabilistic reactive power support for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which are powered by PV units in medium voltage (MV) commercial networks. In this study, analytical expressions are first presented to estimate the size of charging stations integrated with PV units with an objective of minimizing energy losses. These stations are capable of providing reactive power support to the main grid in addition to charging PHEVs while considering the probability of PV generation. The study is further extended to investigate the impact of time-varying voltage-dependent charging load models on PV penetration. The simulation results obtained on an 18-bus test distribution system show that various charging load models can produce dissimilar levels of PHEV and PV penetration. Particularly, the maximum energy loss and peak load reductions are achieved at 70.17% and 42.95% respectively for the mixed charging load model, where the system accommodates respective PHEV and PV penetration levels of 9.51% and 50%.

Hence, design and modeling of charging stations (CSs) has vital importance in distribution system level. In this paper, a new formulation for PHEV charging stations is presented with the strategic presence of wind power generation (WPG). This study considers constraints of the system losses, the regulatory voltage limits, and the charge/discharge schedule of PHEV based on the social behavior of drivers for appropriate placement of PHEV charging stations in electricity grid. The role of CSs and WPG units must be correctly assessed to optimize the investment and operation cost for the whole system. However, the wind generation owners (WGOs) have different objective functions which might be contrary to the objectives of distribution system manager (DSM). It is assumed that aggregating and management of charge/discharge program of PHEVs are smartly carried out by DSM. This paper presents a long-term bi-objective model for optimal planning of PHEV charging stations and WPG units in distribution systems which simultaneously optimize two objectives, namely the benefits of DSM and WGO. It also considers the uncertainty of load growth, electricity price and PHEV access to the charging station using Mont-Carlo simulation (MCS) method. Initial state of charge uncertainty is also modeled based on scenario approach in PHEV batteries and wind turbine power generation using weibull distribution.

Sometimes, it is not possible to install a large capacity of the BESS. On the other hand, the competition of the electricity market has been increased due to the deregulation and liberalization of the power market. Therefore, the power companies are required to reduce the generation cost in order to maximize the profit. In this paper, a thermal units commitment program considers the demand response system to satisfy the transmission constraints. The BESS capacity can be reduced by the demand response system. The electric vehicle (EV) and heat pump (HP) in the smart house are considered as the controllable loads of the demand side. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by extensive simulation results which ensure the reduction of BESS capacity and power generation cost, and satisfy the transmission constraints. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage system; Demand response; Renewable energy; Smart grid; Transmission constraint; Unit commitment","Commerce; Cost reduction; Costs; Deregulation; Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric machine control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Heating; Power markets; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Demand response; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Transmission constraint; Unit-commitment; Smart power grids; cost analysis; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; energy resource; installation; machinery; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; storage","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976583591"

Undoubtedly, the distribution networks cope with congestion issues much more often due to distributed generation and increased network use. Such issues are often handled by unit re-dispatching in short term and grid expansion in long term. Re-dispatching is, however, not always an appropriate solution for local distribution networks since the limited generation units are mostly RES of uncontrollable volatility. Recovering the incurred investment costs on the other hand would trigger an increase of the network tariffs. A possible solution is to defer such an investment by utilizing the demand side resources. The FlexMart model, developed and suggested in this paper, provides the ability for the Distribution System Operator (DSO) to purchase demand flexibility offered by residential consumers. Two feeders with different topologies are tested and the ability of the suggested mechanism to provide benefits for the involved stakeholders, both the DSO and the consumers, is demonstrated. The developed empirical model, works as a long-term planning tool and has the ability to provide an optimal combination of physical expansions and flexibility dispatch to reassure the stable and secure operation of the grid. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Demand side management; DSO; Flexibility; Intermittent renewables; Network investment deferral","Demand side management; Electric utilities; Expansion; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Demand side resources; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Flexibility; Intermittent renewables; Local distribution networks; Network investment; Renewable energy source; Residential consumers; Electric load dispatching; electric vehicle; empirical analysis; energy resource; long-term change; network analysis; renewable resource; stakeholder; topology; Europe","This work was supported by the KIC InnoEnergy Master school.

Firstly, the implementation cost of demand response is calculated using the system income difference. Secondly, a wind power plant, photovoltaic power, an electric vehicle group and a conventional power plant are aggregated into a virtual power plant. A stochastic scheduling model is proposed for the virtual power plant, considering uncertainties under three objective functions. Thirdly, a three-stage hybrid intelligent solution algorithm is proposed, featuring the particle swarm optimization algorithm, the entropy weight method and the fuzzy satisfaction theory. Finally, the Yunnan distributed power demonstration project in China is utilized for example analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that when considering uncertainties, the system will reduce the grid connection of the wind power plant and photovoltaic power to decrease the power shortage punishment cost. The average reduction of the system power shortage punishment cost and the operation revenue of virtual power plant are 61.5% and 1.76%, respectively, while the average increase of the system abandoned energy cost is 40.4%. The output of the virtual power plant exhibits a reverse distribution with the confidence degree of the uncertainty variable. The proposed algorithm rapidly calculates a global optimal set. The electric vehicle group could provide spinning reserve to ensure stability of the output of the virtual power plant.

Demand forecast is usually designed for the seasonally changing load patterns. However, with the high penetration of EVs, daily charging demand makes traditional forecasting methods less accurate. This paper presents an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method for demand forecasting of conventional electrical load (CEL) and charging demand of EV (CDE) parking lots simultaneously. Our EV charging demand prediction model takes daily driving patterns and distances as an input to determine the expected charging load profiles. The parameters of the ARIMA model are tuned so that the mean square error (MSE) of the forecaster is minimized. We improve the accuracy of ARIMA forecaster by optimizing the integrated and auto-regressive order parameters. Furthermore, due to the different seasonal and daily pattern of CEL and CDE, the proposed decoupled demand forecasting method provides significant improvement in terms of error reduction. The impact of EV charging demand on the accuracy of the proposed load forecaster is also analyzed in two approaches: (1) integrated forecaster for CEL + CDE, and (2) decoupled forecaster that targets CEL and CDE independently. The forecaster outputs are used to formulate a chance-constrained day-ahead scheduling problem. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed forecaster and its influence on the stochastic power system operation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); Chance-constrained security-constrained unit commitment; Charging demand; Demand forecasting; Electric vehicle parking lots","Charging (batteries); Crashworthiness; Electric vehicles; Mean square error; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Vehicles; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Charging demands; Demand forecasting; Security constrained unit commitment; Vehicle parking; Forecasting","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994432330"

The implementation of appropriate vehicle to grid energy management system can maximize the potential of electric vehicles to provide grid ancillary services. This paper proposes an optimal vehicle to grid planning and scheduling by utilizing a novel double layer multi-objective algorithm. This optimization algorithm utilizes the grid-connected electric vehicles to perform peak load shaving and load levelling services to minimize the power grid load variance in the first layer optimization. Meanwhile, the second layer optimization minimizes the reactive power compensation for grid voltage regulation and therefore, optimizes the vehicle to grid charger's capacitor sizing. The second layer optimization algorithm utilizes an approximated formula from the simulation of a vehicle to grid charger. The proposed vehicle to grid optimization algorithm considers various power grid and electric vehicle constraints for practicality purpose. With the real time implementation of the proposed algorithm, the optimization results show that the power load curve is effectively followed the preset constant target loading, while the grid voltage is successfully regulated to the predetermined voltage level with minimal amount of reactive power supply from the optimal charger's capacitor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery charger; Bidirectional power flow; Electric vehicle; Optimization; Vehicle to grid; Voltage regulation","Algorithms; Charging (batteries); Curve fitting; Electric load flow; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Energy management systems; Optimization; Reactive power; Real time control; Scheduling; Vehicles; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Battery chargers; Bidirectional power flow; Multi objective algorithm; Optimization algorithms; Reactive power compensation; Real-time implementations; Revolutionary technology; Vehicle to grids; Electric power transmission networks; algorithm; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy flow; energy planning; energy use; optimization; technological development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978883538"

A critical challenge with renewable energies is natural intermittency and as such can be addressed appropriately using Energy Storage Systems (ESS). In this paper, optimal planning of battery based energy storage units is proposed in distribution network. As an important challenge in optimal storage planning, the uncertainty investigation is dealt with in this work. A new approach which is based on Point Estimate Method (PEM) is introduced as a tool to handle the uncertainty of the load, the Wind-based Distributed Generation (WDG) and PEVs demand, simultaneously. The proposed method is intuitively compared with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) as well as conventional PEM for a case study and the results are verified through the comparisons. Moreover, in order to challenge voltage control benefit of the storage units, the under study distribution network is equipped to the tap-changer and the capacitor banks. Whereas the optimal storage planning is a very complicated task, a modified hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is used to solve the related optimization problem.

The proposed EMS aims at optimal allocation of active elements including electric vehicles (EVs), distributed generations (DGs), and responsive loads (RLs). To avoid the adverse effects of EVs' burden, a price-sensitive priority-based smart charging approach is outlined. As an innovative point, the potential of EVs in providing ancillary services such as reactive power provision is addressed in improving the MG's techno-economical performance. Moreover, the infield automatically controlled switches (ACSs) are accommodated to yield in optimal hourly reconfigurations. This practice would definitely impinge on the scheduling patterns of active elements and enhance the performance of the MG. Furthermore, the effects of reconfigurations and EVs' reactive power processes are explored on the capacity release of DGs, EV reliance, and imported power from the upper grid. The released/unallocated capacities are offered as reserve resources for undertaking the renewables' intermittency and load forecasting uncertainties. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and tackled based on time-varying inertia weight factor particle swam optimization.

In addition, as an uncertain load Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) will introduce a new concern in voltage adjustment of future distribution networks. Hence, this paper presents a flexible active-reactive power based Wind Distributed Generation (WDG) planning procedure to address the mentioned challenges. The uncertainties related to WDGs, load demand as well as PEVs load have been handled using the Point Estimate Method (PEM). The distribution network under study is equipped to on-load tap-changer and, as a conventional voltage control component, the Capacitor Banks (CBs) will be planned simultaneously with WDGs. The planning procedure has been considered as a two-loop optimization problem that is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu Search (TS) algorithms. The tap position and power factor of WDGs are taken into account as stochastic variables with practical limitations. The proposed methodology is applied to a typical distribution network and several scenarios are considered and analyzed. Simulation results show that the standard deviation of power factor depends on PEVs penetration that highlights the capability curve of WDGs. The optimal penetration of wind power increases nonlinearly versus increasing of PEVs connected to the distribution network, however the fixed CBs are required to increase the optimal penetration of WDGs. The proposed Modified PSO (MPSO) is compared with the conventional PSO in numerical studies that show MPSO is more efficient than the conventional algorithm for this analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Distribution network; Flexible active-reactive power; Plug-in electric vehicles; Wind energy","Distributed power generation; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power factor; Electric vehicles; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Plug-in electric vehicles; Reactive power; Stochastic systems; Tabu search; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicles; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Wind power; Active distribution networks; Active-reactive power; Conventional algorithms; Distributed generation planning; On- load tap changers; Optimization methodology; Point estimate method; Tabu search algorithms; Electric power distribution","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978427877"

The inconsistent nature of wind speed and wind power is characterized by the Weibull probability distribution function considering overestimation and underestimation costs of stochastic wind power. The comprehensive comparative analysis of the economic viability on unit commitment is carried out to minimize the total cost of the entire system.

First, the concept and characteristic variables (trip start time, driving time, parking duration, driving distance and trip purpose) of trip chain are introduced. Second, the probability distribution models of these variables are established considering their correlative relationships. Third, using Monte Carlo method, the complete trip chains are simulated, and then the spatial-temporal distributions of charging demands are calculated. Finally, based on the National household trip survey data, and according to the proposed method, charging demands in different areas are studied.

In this study, environmental impacts of various alternative delivery trucks including battery electric, diesel, diesel-electric hybrid, and compressed natural gas trucks are analyzed. A novel life cycle assessment method, an environmentally-extended multi-region input-output analysis, is utilized to calculate energy and carbon footprints throughout the supply chain of alternative delivery trucks. The uncertainties due to fuel consumption or other key parameter variations in real life, data ranges are taken into consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, variations in regional electricity mix greenhouse gas emission are also considered to present a region-specific assessment for each vehicle type. According to the analysis results, although the battery electric delivery trucks have zero tailpipe emission, electric trucks are not expected to have lower environmental impacts compared to other alternatives. On average, the electric trucks have slightly more greenhouse emissions and energy consumption than those of other trucks.

Specifically, we investigate how to better deliver the value of EVs by improving designs in the power system and charging strategies, given expected developments by 2030 in both the power system and EV penetration levels. The impact of EV charging is quantified by applying an integrated transportation-power system model on a set of scenarios which represent uncertainties in charging strategies. We find that deploying EVs essentially shifts the use of gasoline to coal-fired power generation in China, thus leading to more coal consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the power system. Economically, EVs outperform gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of average fueling costs. However, the impact of EVs in terms of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions at the national level largely depends on the charging strategy. Specifically, controlled charging results in more CO<inf>2</inf> emissions associated with EVs than uncontrolled charging, as it tends to feed EVs with electricity produced by cheap yet low-efficiency coal power plants located in regions where coal prices are low. Still, compared with uncontrolled charging, controlled charging shows absolute advantages in: (1) mitigating the peak load arising from EV charging; (2) facilitating RES generation; and (3) reducing generation costs and EV charging costs. Hence, in light of this trade-off of controlled charging with the goals of energy security, economic efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, policy interventions in the Chinese power system should opt for controlled charging strategies in order to best realize the benefits of EVs. Accordingly, this paper proposes that increasing the use of cleaner forms of electricity generation, such as RES power and gas power, and establishing energy efficiency and CO<inf>2</inf> emission regulations in power dispatch are critical for China. Lastly, this work illustrates what the optimized charging profiles from the power system perspective look like for different regions. These results can inform Chinese policy makers in creating a better integration of the transportation and the power system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Charging; China; Electric vehicles; Energy-economic-environmental implications; Power system","Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Charging (furnace); Coal; Costs; Crashworthiness; Economic and social effects; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Environmental impact; Gasoline; Public policy; Vehicles; China; Coal-fired power generation; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity generation; Environmental implications; Integrated transportations; Power system; Uncontrolled charging; Electric power system economics; carbon dioxide; cost analysis; electric vehicle; emission control; energy planning; energy use; environmental impact; environmental policy; trade-off","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963745998"

In this paper, a novel centralized charging station strategy considering urban power network structure strength is proposed. Based on the analysis of time-space characteristic of load shifting in normal urban life, power supply moment balance index is defined to represent fluctuation of supply capability between peak and valley under certain structure. Meanwhile, the investment of charging stations and network loss are considered as part of objective function with moment balance index, aiming at improving urban power network structure with minimal economic cost.

The paper investigates the impact of such integrations for enhancing the environmental sustainability, social sustainability, and economic operation of electric power systems. The goal is to keep the energy sector on track for addressing the 2 degree Celsius (2DC) target per Copenhagen climate agreement.11In 2010, governments agreed that there is an urgent need to reduce emissions so that global temperature escalations are limited to below 2 degrees Celsius. The paper identifies strategies for large-scale integration of variable generation resources without compromising the electricity infrastructure security. The power system uncertainties pertaining to hourly load and wind energy forecast errors, and random outages of generation and transmission components are taken into consideration in Monte Carlo scenarios. The stochastic optimization of day-ahead hourly scheduling of electricity is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. The merits of the proposed optimization model are demonstrated by applying four numerical case studies. The conclusion is that the applications of renewable energy resources and the intelligent assimilation of EV fleets (both as a provider and a consumer of energy) offer major potentials for alleviating power system peak demands, minimizing power grid operation costs and hourly wind energy curtailments, and limiting the environmental impacts of fossil fuel-based thermal generating units in the stochastic operation of an electricity infrastructure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Renewable energy sources; Stochastic security-constrained unit commitment; Storage; Thermal generation emission; V2G","","This work was supported in part by the NSF under grant CMMI-1550448 .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000692603"

The coordination becomes more challenging when the highly fluctuant renewable energies constitute a significant portion of the power resources. To tackle this problem, a novel two-stage EV charging mechanism is designed in this paper, which mainly includes three parts. At the first stage, based on the prediction of future energy requests and considering the elastic charging property of EVs, an offline optimal energy generation scheduling problem is formulated and solved in a day-ahead manner to determine the energy generation in each time slot the next day. Then, at the second stage, based on the planned energy generation day-ahead, an adaptive real-time charging strategy is developed to determine the charging rate of each vehicle in a dynamic manner. Finally, we develop a charging rate compression (CRC) algorithm, which tremendously reduces the complexity of the problem solving. The fast algorithm supports real-time operations and enables the large-scale small-step scheduling more efficiently. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can help effectively save energy costs and reduce the system PAR. Detailed evaluations on the impact of renewable energy uncertainties show that our proposed approach performs well in enhancing the system fault tolerance against uncertainties and the noises of real-time data. We further extend the mechanism to track a given load profile and handle the scenario where EVs only have several discrete charging rates. As a universal methodology, the proposed scheme is not restricted to any specific data traces and can be easily applied to many other cases as well. © 2016 IEEE.","Charging mechanism design; electric vehicles (EVs); energy generation scheduling; peak shaving; power regulation; renewable energy","Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Crashworthiness; Electric charge; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Fault tolerance; Machine design; Scheduling; Vehicles; Charging mechanism; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy generations; Peak shaving; Power regulation; Renewable energies; Problem solving","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976504278"

Electricity, which is the most flexible and manageable energy form, is currently used in a variety of activities and applications. For instance, electricity is used for heating, cooling, lighting, and for operating electronic appliances and electric vehicles. Nowadays, given the rapid development and commercialization of technologies and devices that rely on electricity, electricity demand is increasing faster than overall primary energy supply. Consequently, the design and planning of power systems is becoming a progressively more important issue in order to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in timely fashion, not only in developed countries but particularly in developing economies where electricity demand is increasing even faster.Power systems are networks of electrical devices, such as power plants, transformers, and transmission lines, used to produce, transmit, and supply electricity. The design and planning of such systems require the selection of generation technologies, along with the capacity, location, and timing of generation and transmission capacity expansions to meet electricity demand over a long-term horizon. This manuscript presents a comprehensive optimization framework for the design and planning of interconnected power systems, including the integration of generation and transmission capacity expansion planning. The proposed framework also considers renewable energies, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, demand-side management (DSM), as well as reserve and CO<inf>2</inf> emission constraints. The novelty of this framework relies on an integrated assessment of the aforementioned features, which can reveal possible interactions and synergies within the power system. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a suite of case studies inspired by a real-world power system, including ""business as usual"" and ""CO<inf>2</inf> mitigation policy"" scenarios.

A linear programming model - POWER (Power system Optimization With diverse Energy Resources) - is constructed and used to (1) quantify flexibility cost-benefits of geographic aggregation, renewable overgeneration, storage, and flexible electric vehicle charging, and (2) compare pathways to a fully renewable electricity system. Geographic aggregation provides the largest flexibility benefit with ~5-50% cost savings, but each region's contribution to the aggregate RPS (renewable portfolio standard) target is disproportionate, suggesting the need for regional-and-resource-specific RPS targets. Electric vehicle charging yields a lower levelized system cost, revealing the benefits of demand-side flexibility. However, existing demand response price structures may need adjustment to encourage optimal flexible load in highly renewable systems. Two scenarios with RPS targets from 20% to 100% for the US (peak load ~729 GW) and California (peak load ~62 GW) find each RPS target feasible from a planning perspective, but with 2× the cost and 3× the overgeneration at a 100% versus 80% RPS target. Emission reduction cost savings for the aggregated US system with an 80% versus 20% RPS target are roughly $200 billion/year, outweighing the $80 billion/year cost for the same RPS range. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Aggregation; Electric vehicle charging; Energy system analysis; Renewable energy integration; Storage; Transmission","Agglomeration; Aggregates; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy resources; Energy storage; Linear programming; Transmissions; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Electric vehicle charging; Energy system analysis; Flexibility mechanisms; Linear programming models; Power system optimization; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable portfolio standard; Costs; aggregation; cost-benefit analysis; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy policy; energy use; future prospect; linear programing; methodology; planning system; renewable resource; California; United States","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959076398"

Data from the Dutch Meteorological Institute is used to determine the optimal orientation of PV panels for maximum energy yield in the Netherlands. The seasonal and diurnal variation in solar insolation is analyzed to determine the energy availability for EV charging and the necessity for grid connection. Due to relatively low solar insolation in Netherlands, it has been determined that the power rating of the PV array can be oversized by 30% with respect to power rating of the converter. Various dynamic EV charging profiles are compared with an aim to minimize the grid dependency and to maximize the usage of solar power to directly charge the EV. Two scenarios are considered - one where the EVs have to be charged only on weekdays and the second case where EV have to be charged all 7 days/week. A priority mechanism is proposed to facilitate the charging of multiple EV from a single EV-PV charger. The feasibility of integrating a local storage to the EV-PV charger to make it grid independent is evaluated.

Vehicle to Grid systems are promising substitutes for traditional gas turbine generators, which are relatively inefficient and have high emissions impacts. The purpose of this study is to predict the future net revenue and life cycle emissions savings of Vehicle to Grid technologies for use in ancillary (regulation) services on a regional basis in the United States. In this paper, the emissions savings and net revenue calculations are conducted with respect to five different Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Organization regions, after which future EV market penetration rates are predicted using an Agent-Based Model designed to account for various uncertainties, including regulation service payments, regulation signal features, and battery degradation. Finally, the concept of Exploratory Modeling and Analysis is used to estimate the future net revenue and emissions savings of integrating Vehicle to Grid technology into the grid, considering the inherent uncertainties of the system. The results indicate that, for a single vehicle, the net revenue of Vehicle to Grid services is highest for the New York region, which is approximately $42,000 per vehicle on average. However, the PJM region has an approximately $97 million overall net revenue potential, given the 38,200 Vehicle to Grid-service-available electric vehicles estimated to be on the road in the future in the PJM region, which is the highest among the studied regions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-Based Modeling; Emissions; Exploratory Modeling and Analysis; Net revenue; Planning and forecasting; Vehicle to Grid","Autonomous agents; Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Computational methods; Crashworthiness; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Grid computing; Life cycle; Particulate emissions; Turbogenerators; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicles; Agent-based model; Electric power demands; Independent system operators; Life cycle emissions; Model and analysis; Net revenue; Regulation services; Vehicle to grids; Secondary batteries; electric vehicle; electrical power; forecasting method; industrial emission; numerical model; planning method; technological development; turbine; New York [United States]; United States","This work was supported in part by an award to the University of Central Florida, as part of Grant Number DTRT13-G-UTC51 from the US Department of Transportation’s University Transportation Centers Program .","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957088452"

Massive EVs pose both opportunities and challenges for power systems, especially with the growing amount of wind-power integration. This paper investigates the problem of collaborative optimization scheduling of generators, EVs and wind power. A novel bi-layer optimization of transmission and distribution system is proposed to solve the scheduling problem of EVs charging and discharging load from respective time and space domain in the presence of wind-power. The upper layer optimization in transmission grid coordinates EVs with thermal generators, base load, with the consideration of wind power, to optimize load periods of EVs in the time domain. The lower layer optimization in distribution grid then spatially schedules the location of EVs load. Based on a power system benchmark with a 10-unit transmission grid and an IEEE 33-bus distribution grid, the performance of the proposed bi-layer optimization strategy is evaluated. The impacts of electricity price profile, EVs penetration and EVs load location are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed bi-layer optimization strategy can accommodate wind power and improve both the economics of grid operation and benefits of EV users by scheduling EVs charging and discharging temporally and spatially. Also, the results have shown that the location of EVs charging and discharging load is critical for the distribution network planning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bi-layer optimization; Charging and discharging scheduling; Electric vehicle; PM2.5 emissions; Unit commitment; Wind power","Benchmarking; Crashworthiness; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Location; Scheduling; Vehicles; Wind power; Bi-layer; Collaborative optimization; Distribution network planning; Environmental-friendly; Optimization strategy; Transmission and distribution systems; Unit-commitment; Wind power integrations; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; benchmarking; cost-benefit analysis; electric vehicle; electricity supply; emission; fossil fuel; optimization; particulate matter; wind power","The work is funded by the National Science Foundation of China ( 51277135 , 50707021 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 2042015kf1004 ), Wuhan Power Supply Company and Hebei Power Technology Research Institute .","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956862265"

Thus, effective scheduling of both resources holds the key to sustainable practice. This paper presents a scheduling scenario-based approach in the smart grid. Problem formulation with dual objective function including both emissions and cost is developed for conventional unit commitment with EV and RET deployment. In this work, the scheduling and commitment problem is solved using the fireworks algorithm which mimics explosion of fireworks in the sky to define search space and the distance between associated sparks to evaluate global minimum. Further, binary coded fireworks algorithm is developed for the proposed scheduling problem in the smart grid. Thereafter, possible scenarios in conventional as well as smart grid are put forward.

The methodologies have proposed in contrast with the conventional algorithm in which the transmission line investment cost has been minimized without considering the dynamism of the deregulated environment. Moreover, the transmission network planning enhances the competitiveness of the power market, where more market players can participate. In this situation, the network planner has an important role in assessing the needs for transmission investments. Now-a-days practice of the network planner is to utilize more renewable power resources, PEVs and implementation of different electricity price tariffs. To achieve more benefits of PEVs and wind energy, their optimal utilization is a major concern. This paper proposes a mathematical model for solving the combined effect of PEVs and wind power integration with incentive-based DR program on static transmission network expansion planning (STNEP) problem. To solve this non-linear and non-convex problem, a nature-inspired optimization algorithm named gbest-guided artificial bee colony algorithm (GABC) is applied due to its robustness.

Second, a systematic optimal sizing framework was constructed. The feasible region of the design parameters was divided into a certain number of grid points, and each grid point represented different design results. Then, a dynamic programming algorithm was applied to each grid point to locate the optimal control strategy and obtain the best grid points under different power levels. After that, a bi-level optimization method was applied at these selected grid points to find the optimal design parameters.

In fact, the path towards car electrification is started worldwide, but the rate of increase of electrically powered cars will depend primarily on charging stations availability. In this respect, utilities that manage/own local grids may be key actors by investing on infrastructures and thus locally creating the conditions for the spreading of electric cars. A techno-economic analysis of the investment of a local utility has been performed taking into account medium- and long term-forecasts of electricity and fuel prices, as well as electric cars market share and economic risk. The study proved that an investment in urban charging station infrastructure in Italy can be profitable even without incentives, with a payback period of 4-5 years. The results of the analysis have been exploited by an Italian utility which owns/manages the local electric grid in two municipalities. The first steps of the plan implementation, which started in 2014, are reported in the paper. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Charging stations; Electric mobility plan; EV (Electric vehicles); Local energy planning; Smart cities; Urban mobility","Competition; Economic analysis; Investments; Risk assessment; Charging station; Electric mobility; EV (Electric vehicles); Local energy planning; Smart cities; Urban mobility; Electric power transmission networks; electric vehicle; electricity; electrification; energy planning; investment; local planning; smart city; technological development; urban transport; Italy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960424699"

The laboratory methodology is explained through tests on a demonstrator of power architecture, specifically designed as simplified case study of a DC charging station for fully-electrified low-power two-wheeler, such as: electric scooters and bikes. This experimental prototype is composed by a 20 kW AC/DC bidirectional grid-tied converter, which realizes the DC conversion stage, and two DC/DC power converters, interconnected with the micro-grid through a DC bus. The power architecture provides on one hand the charging operations of electric two-wheeler battery packs and on the other hand the integration of the micro-grid with an ES buffer, which has the main function of supporting the main grid while an electric vehicle is on charge. The performance of the considered architecture is characterized and analyzed in different operative conditions, through a specific management of the energy fluxes. The laboratory tests evaluate efficiency, charging times and impact on the main grid, with specific reference to the DC charging operations of electric scooters. The obtained experimental results show the advantages of adopting the DC buffer architecture, compared with an AC commercial battery charger, considered as reference in this work. Finally, the numerical data of this paper, related to the single power components and to the experimental results evaluated for the whole demonstrator, effectively support the lack of knowledge in the literature about charging stations for EVs. In fact, these pieces of information, based on experimental tests, are expected to support the building of simulation models and the identification of the best energy management and control strategies to be adopted in a smart-grid scenario, characterized by distributed generation systems including renewable energy sources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Charging stations; Electric vehicles; Energy storage systems; Main grid impact","Charging (batteries); Crashworthiness; DC-DC converters; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Information management; Rectifying circuits; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Charging station; DC/DC power converters; Distributed generation system; Energy storage systems; Experimental evaluation; Grid impacts; Management and controls; Renewable energy source; Smart power grids; architecture; design; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy use; experimental study; knowledge; storage","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928179856"

The results allowed to obtain an electric model of the EV charging cycle. The procedures and results of tests on the DC semi-fast charging cycle of EVs used for the public transportation in Bogota D.C. are presented. Some tests to the EV charging cycle were applied in steady state in order to evaluate the performance and the power quality of EVs. The fact that the charging system has a total harmonic current distortion (THDi) of 7% and a total harmonic voltage distortion (THDv) that satisfactorily comply with local and international regulations is highlighted. Tests were performed in transient state of the charger and their analysis was done by using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Results in transient state of the beginning of the DC charging cycle of EVs reveal that the harmonics of greater impact are 3°, 4°, and 5°. Finally, based on the analysis of the presented results, a simulation profile of the charging system was designed using the Matlab Sim Power Systems tool. The obtained model shows an error of 2% compared to measurements in steady state.

Rapid development of PEVs brings new opportunities and challenges to the electricity distribution network's dispatching. A high number of uncoordinated charging PEVs has significant negative impacts on the secure and economic operation of a distribution network. In this paper, a bi-level programming approach that coordinates PEVs' charging with the network load and electricity price of the open market is presented. The major objective of the upper level model is to minimize the total network costs and the deviation of electric vehicle aggregators' charging power and the equivalent power. The subsequent objective of the lower level model after the upper level decision is to minimize the dispatching deviation of the sum of PEVs' charging power and their optimization charging power under the upper level model. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the bi-level programming.

The key issue in this system is recharging the EV batteries before they are exhausted. Thus, charging stations (CSs) should be carefully located to make sure EV users can access a CS within their driving range. Considering geographic information and traffic density, this paper proposes an optimization overture for optimal siting and sizing of a rapid CS (RCS). It aims to minimize the daily total cost (which includes the cost of substation energy loss, traveling cost of EVs to the CS, and investment, variable, and operational costs of the stations simultaneously) while maintaining system constraints. The binary gravitational search algorithm, genetic algorithm, and binary particle swarm optimization algorithm were employed to optimize the daily total cost by finding the best location and sizing of the RCS in a given metropolitan area in Malaysia. The results show that the proposed methods can find optimal locations and sizing of a RCS that can benefit EV users, CS developers, and the power grid. © 2016 TÜBİTAK.","Electric vehicles; Genetic algorithm; Gravitational search algorithm; Optimal planning; Particle swarm optimization; Rapid charging station","Algorithms; Bins; Carbon; Costs; Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy dissipation; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Roads and streets; Vehicles; Binary particle swarm optimization; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Geographic information; Gravitational search algorithms; Location and sizings; Optimal planning; Rapid charging; System constraints; Charging (batteries)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978289515"

Existing grid expansion can always be treated as one of the ways of powering them over long transmission and distribution lines. This is often characterized by significant transmission losses, as well as significant investments, depending on the distance and the infrastructure development. On the other hand, there are cases when these consumers are not connected to the power system and use alternative methods of supply. For that matter, possible solutions may use locally available energy sources. In this paper, comparative analyses between independent power supply through particular hybrid power system (HPS) configurations and the distribution network expansion option are performed. Storage, which represents a major problem in such HPS concepts today due to cost and capacity, is proposed to be in the accumulators of electric vehicles. In addition, an analytical methodology for selecting a sustainable solution for powering remote consumers was implemented. This analysis was verified with reference to a specific type of consumer, a winter tourist center, using real indicators and measured data on wind and solar energy potential at the site. It was shown that such an approach improves the selection of the most favorable sustainable supply solution and is suitable for consumers away from developed distribution networks, e.g., tourist centers, livestock pastures, and small factories. Proposed HPS concepts with storage in the electric vehicles of guests and employees could be a viable solution when this transportation mode becomes dominant in the future. © 2016 TÜBİTAK.","Hybrid power system; Remote powering; Renewable energy; Sustainable power system planning","Agriculture; Digital storage; Electric power distribution; Electric power systems; Investments; Public policy; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Analytical methodology; Hybrid power systems; Hybrid power systems (HPS); Infrastructure development; Remote powering; Renewable energies; Sustainable power systems; Transmission and distribution; Renewable energy resources","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978204501"

This increases the challenge of balancing intermittent generation with demand fluctuation. DR (Demand response) is recognized as a way to address this by adapting consumption to supply patterns. By using DR technology, grid withdrawal of DSM (demand side management) devices such as heat pumps, electric vehicles or stationary batteries can be temporally shifted. Yet, the development of an accurate control and market design is still one of the greatest remaining DR challenges. We present a range of flexible price signals that can address this by acting as effective demand control mechanisms. The different tariffs consist of combinations of flexible energy and power price signals. Their impact on the unit commitment of automatable DSM devices is tested for a set of German households. The financial outcome for the respective stakeholders are quantified. Our results suggest flexible power pricing can reduce overall demand peaks as well as limit simultaneous grid withdrawals caused by real time pricing incentives. Furthermore, we prove that inefficient designs of flexible power pricing can lead to undesired bidding of automatable devices. We propose a specific tariff design that shows robust network performance and reduces energy procurement costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Electricity tariff; Flexible power pricing; Residential energy management; Residential storage","Carbon; Costs; Crashworthiness; Electric utilities; Heating; Housing; Demand fluctuations; Demand response; DR (demand response); Electricity networks; Electricity tariff; Power pricing; Residential energy; Stationary batteries; Electric power transmission networks; demand analysis; demand-side management; design method; electric vehicle; electricity generation; price determination; renewable resource; residential energy; stakeholder; tariff structure; technological change","The research of M.S. at the University of Melbourne was financially supported by a PhD grant from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

Nowadays, most attention is paid to electric vehicles in the transport systems and the use of renewable energy in the power systems. The aim of this work is to achieve a 100 % renewable and sustainable system and to examine the impact of electrification in the transport sector on the power curve and the integration of renewable energy into the power systems of the Dubrovnik region up to 2050. Methods: The analyses of different charging regulation models for the electric vehicles were derived in the EnergyPLAN, which is a computer model for Energy Systems Analysis of the major energy systems and runs on an hourly basis. Calculations were done for selected years—2020, 2030 and 2050. Charging models provided in the EnergyPLAN were dumb charge, flexible demand, smart charge and smart charge with vehicle-to-grid. For each year, two different charging models were selected. Charging regulations according to three tariff models, based on a lower and higher electricity price, with different distributions, were also done for 2050, i.e. tariff model 1, 2 and 3. Results: The results for the year 2020 showed no difference between the models. In 2030, smart charge gained better results than a flexible demand. In 2050, the flexible demand allowed to achieve better results than the smart charge with vehicle-to-grid and the tariff model 1, while tariff model 3 provided the best results for 2050. It is also shown that the energy systems which include electric vehicles have a greater impact on the reduction of a critical excess electricity production than the systems excluding electric vehicles. Conclusions: The power system of the Dubrovnik region was set up as an isolated system, and the electric vehicle batteries are the only storage provided. The results showed that each scenario yielded an excess in electricity produced in the system, which means that the available storage was insufficient and there was a need for more storage capacities in order to achieve a 100 % renewable and sustainable power system. © 2015, Šare et al.","Electric distribution system; Electric vehicles; Renewable energy sources; Smart charge; Vehicles-to-grid","Amphibious vehicles; Charging (batteries); Crashworthiness; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Systems analysis; Vehicles; Electric distribution systems; Electric vehicle batteries; Energy systems analysis; Integration of renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Smart charge; Sustainable power systems; Use of renewable energies; Smart power grids; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy conservation; energy planning; energy resource; greenhouse gas; renewable resource; storage; sustainability; Croatia; Dubrovnik","A financial support from the Croatian Science Foundation through the","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941118681"

The public’s role is expected to change from that of passive service abiders to active service providers, as anticipated by visions of prosumers, smart grids, demand side management, virtual power plants, and electric vehicle management. Smart technology and new business models will increase system complexity and the experience of uncertainty and risk for all parties. Actionability of the public’s participation in the opportunities arising from the transformation of energy systems will become a problem. Methods: With a qualitative functionalist method, we analyze the prerequisites of the public’s participation: the capacity of social mechanisms, such as trust, for the solution of social problems. Functional problems affect the continuation of communication, i.e., the possibility of the sustainment of social reality. We isolate three case studies that illustrate concrete effects of trust, distrust, and confidence on three parties, respectively: consumers, investors, and those affected by grid extensions. Results and conclusions: We argue that the social mechanisms of trust and confidence are more vital for consumers, investors, and those affected than previous research has noticed. These mechanisms determine the achievement of sustainability in energy systems by sustaining actionability as a favorable expectation (trust, confidence), or an unfavorable expectation (lack of trust, distrust).

At first, harmonic power flow analysis is performed by Newton-Raphson method and by considering distorted substation voltage. Afterward, proper sizes of capacitors is selected by cuckoo optimization algorithm to reduce the power losses and cost and by imposing acceptable limit for total harmonic distortion and RMS voltages. It is proposed that the impact of generated current harmonics by electric vehicle battery chargers should be factored into overall load control strategies of smart appliances. This study is generalized to the different hours of a day by using daily load curve, and then optimum time for charging of electric vehicles batteries in the parking lots are determined by cuckoo optimization algorithm. The results show that injecting harmonic currents of plug-in electric vehicles causes a drop in the voltage profile and increases power loss. Moreover, charging the vehicle batteries has more impact on increasing the power losses rather than the harmonic currents effect. Also, the findings showed that the current harmonics has a great influence on increasing of THD. Finally, optimum working times of all parking lots was obtained for the utilization cost reduction. © 2015 by De Gruyter 2015.","Capacitor sizing; Cuckoo optimization algorithm; Distribution network; Electric vehicle; Harmonic power flow; Smart grid","Automotive batteries; Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Curve fitting; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric losses; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Harmonic analysis; Metal drawing; Newton-Raphson method; Optimization; Plug-in electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Control strategies; Current harmonics; Electric vehicle batteries; Harmonic power flow; Optimization algorithms; Smart distribution systems; Smart grid; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Electric power distribution","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84948749188"

This paper proposes a new method for evaluating the effect of integrating a large number of EVs on a power system and their impact on the network voltage profile via injecting reactive power into highly-loaded buses. A multi-objective optimization problem is developed to obtain the optimal siting and sizing of charging stations and renewable energy sources (RES). The optimization problem focuses on reducing power losses, improving voltage stability of the system and reducing charging costs of EVs. In order to increase the network load factor some coefficients are introduced. Such coefficients, which depend on wind speed, solar irradiance and hourly peak demand ratio in the load characteristic of day-ahead, help aggregators to charge their EVs in off-peak hours. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is used for solving the optimization problem.

Different from the previous studies which mostly utilize programming (optimization) models, this paper employed a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to consider some subjective but important criteria for EVCS site selection. To reflect the ambiguity and vagueness due to the subjective judgments of decision makers, fuzzy TOPSIS method was applied to select the optimal EVCS site. Based on academic literatures, feasibility research reports and expert opinions in different fields, the evaluation index system for EVCS site selection was built from sustainability perspective, which consists of environmental, economic and social criteria associated with a total of 11 sub-criteria. Then, the criteria performances of different alternatives and criteria weights were judged by five groups of expert panels in the fields of environment, economy, society, electric power system and transportation system. Finally, the EVCS site alternatives were ranked by employing fuzzy TOPSIS method. The result shows EVCS site A2 located at Changping district in Beijing obtains the highest ranking score and should be selected as the optimal site. Meanwhile, the environmental and social criteria are paid more attentions from decision makers than economic criteria. The sensitivity analysis results indicate the alternative A2 always secures its top ranking no matter how sub-criteria weights change. It is effective and robust to apply fuzzy TOPSIS method into EVCS site selection. This paper provides a new research perspective for site selection and also extends the application domains of fuzzy TOPSIS method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric vehicle charging station (EVCS); Fuzzy TOPSIS; Sensitivity analysis; Site selection; Sustainability","Amphibious vehicles; Charging (batteries); Decision making; Electric power system economics; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Vehicles; Academic literature; Economic criteria; Electric vehicle charging; Evaluation index system; FUZZY TOPSIS; Multi-criteria decision making; Sustainable site; Transportation system; Site selection; cost analysis; decision making; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy use; feasibility study; fuzzy mathematics; literature review; multicriteria analysis; numerical method; site selection; sustainability; Beijing [China]; Changping; China","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.71373076, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant No. 2015XS28 and the Beijing Sino-foreign Joint Postgraduate Training Co-construction Project.

It is here achieved by the mean of a grid commitment over the overall power produced by a collaborative system which here gathers a photovoltaic (PV) plant with an EV fleet. The scope of the present contribution is to investigate the conditions to make the most of such an association, mainly regarding to the management strategies and optimal sizing, taking into account forecast errors on PV production. Design/methodology/approach-To evaluate the collaboration added value, several concerns are aggregated into a primary energy criterion: the commitment compliance, the power spillage, the vehicle charging, the user mobility and the battery aging. Variations of these costs are computed over a range of EV fleet size. Moreover, the influence of the charging strategy is specifically investigated throughout the comparison of three managements: a simple rule of thumb, a perfect knowledge deterministic case and a charging strategy computed by stochastic dynamic programming. The latter is based on an original modeling of the production forecast error. This methodology is carried out to assess the collaboration added value for two operators' points of view: a virtual power plant (VPP) and a balance responsible party (BRP). Findings-From the perspective of a BRP, the added value of PV-EV collaboration for the energy system has been evidenced in any situation even when the charging strategy is very simple. On the other hand, for the case of a VPP operator, the coupling between the optimal sizing and the management strategy is highlighted. Originality/value-A co-optimization of the sizing and the management of a PV-EV collaborative system is introduced and the influence of the management strategy on the collaboration added value has been investigated. This gave rise to the presentation and implementation of an original modeling tool of the PV production forecast error. Finally, to widen the scope of application, two different business models have been tackled and compared. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Co-optimization; Collaborative system; Electric vehicle; Optimal energy management; Photovoltaic; Stochastic dynamic programming","Charging (batteries); Dynamic programming; Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Errors; Forecasting; Stochastic systems; Co-optimization; Collaborative systems; Management strategies; Photovoltaic; Production forecasts; Scope of application; Stochastic dynamic programming; Virtual power plants (VPP); Fleet operations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945554004"

Two real networks representing an urban and rural area, and a generic network representative of a heavily loaded UK distribution network were used. The findings show that distribution networks are not a homogeneous group with a variation of capabilities to accommodate EVs and there is a greater capability than previous studies have suggested. Consideration of the spatial and temporal diversity of EV charging demand has been demonstrated to reduce the estimated impacts on the distribution networks. It is suggested that distribution network operators could collaborate with new market players, such as charging infrastructure operators, to support the roll out of an extensive charging infrastructure in a way that makes the network more robust; create more opportunities for demand side management; and reduce planning uncertainties associated with the stochastic nature of EV charging demand. © 2015 The Authors.","Distribution network; Electric Vehicle (EV); Load profiles; Smart meter; Spatial-temporal data; User behaviour","Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Crashworthiness; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Smart meters; Stochastic systems; Vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Distribution network operators; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity distribution networks; Load profiles; Probabilistic approaches; Spatial-temporal data; User behaviour; Probability distributions","Funding text 1: The Customer-Led Network Revolution (CLNR) project is funded by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) under the Low Carbon Network Fund.

The challenge of alleviating additional uncertainty and variability brought by new sources to the system operation is seen as defining both flexibility capacities and flexibility requirements through provision of multiple services. In this context the role of emerging technologies, such as electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage (ES), is recognized through their active participation in providing both energy and reserve service.This paper elaborates on the benefits of active EV participation in multiple system services through various charging strategies. The presented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) unit commitment problem (UC) considers the capability of EV to provide primary, secondary and tertiary reserve as well as energy, however the focus is put on the benefits of EV providing spinning reserve services. The results clearly show benefits of multiple EV role to that of providing energy only.

Different from private electric vehicles, EBs are scheduled by a public transport company and required to be charged as soon as possible during operation hours. Consequently, the implementation of fast charging stations (FCSs) is essential to support the operation of EBs. Usually, the size of an FCS is constrained by the residual capacity of the connected distribution network and the investment budget. An energy storage system (ESS) is considered as a potential supplement not only to reduce the network integration cost for FCSs but also to reduce the charging cost of EBs through electricity price arbitrage. To quantify the value of ESS in an electric bus FCS, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for optimal sizing and control of FCS and ESS is built. A simplification method is proposed to convert the MINLP problem to a linear one without any loss in optimality, which accelerates the solving process. Simulations are performed based on historical data of a practical FCS. Numerical results indicate that ESS can significantly help reduce the overall investment and charging cost of the FCS. Meanwhile, the parameters of investment cost, lifespan and time-of-use electricity price have significant influences on the overall value of ESS for an FCS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric bus; Energy storage system; Fast charging station; Mixed integer program","Budget control; Buses; Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Costs; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Electric bus; Energy storage systems; Environmental friendliness; Fast charging stations; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Mixed-integer programs; Simplification method; Time-of-use electricity price; Investments","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51107060 and 51261130473 ).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84934900447"

One way to address these challenges is to use storage devices that can store surplus energy from RESs and discharge the energy back to the grid when needed. Researchers have recently introduced the idea to use electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, which are called 'gridable vehicles' (GVs), as storage devices in the smart grid. Using GVs as loads is well accepted, but as sources, they disrupt system reliability if insufficient GVs are available for discharging when needed. An availability planning model is thus required to address this issue. GV owners' concern over battery lifetime reductions is another issue that impedes the required participation rates for GVs in vehicle-to-grid discharge programs. In this paper, we present an intelligent smart grid system model, which mitigates real-time unavailability of GV sources via an availability planning model. We also propose a GV selection model that prevents GV batteries from premature expiry due to their vehicle-to-grid operations. Simulation results confirm that our proposed models maintain better overall reliability and increase average battery lifetime by up to 3.5 years compared with existing vehicle-to-grid models. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Battery lifetime; gridable vehicles (GVs); participation rate; smart grid; system reliability; vehicle-to-grid","Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Electric power distribution; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electromagnetic wave emission; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Virtual storage; Battery lifetime; Gridable vehicles; Participation rate; Smart grid; System reliability; Vehicle to grids; Smart power grids","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027952710"

By giving vehicle performance of gradability, maximal speeds in hybrid and pure electric modes, the power sources of the 210 kg target vehicle are: a 125 cc engine and two 1.8 kW motor and generator. The optimal tank-to-wheel efficiencies, ratios of circulating power, and operation points at specific vehicle speeds and out loads are calculated. Simulation results show that the dual-motor electric vehicle mode offers superior performance regarding electric drive; the low capacity of the battery is conducive to reducing manufacturing and maintenance costs; the tank-to-wheel efficiency is mainly operated above 20% while the power split electronic-continuously-variable-transmission mode is the major operation mode, and a maximum of 17% fuel economy improvement is achieved compared with the Toyota Hybrid System in most of the vehicle speed ranges.

Although many studies have introduced novel models to integrate distributed generation into high levels of EV-adoption scenarios, none has considered EV-embedded battery performance degradation and its economic effect on system planning. Based on well-established models and data to emulate the capacity fading of lithium-ion batteries, the current work presents a mixed-integer linear programming optimization framework with decision variables to size renewable energy resources (RESs) in modern microgrids. The objective function aims to minimize the total cost of the system while guaranteeing a profitable operation level of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) application, narrowing the gap between design stage and real-life daily operation patterns. Stochastic modeling is used to incorporate the effect of different uncertainties involved in the issue. A case study on a residential system in Okinawa, Japan, is introduced to quantitatively illustrate how a profitable V2G operation can affect RES sizing. The results reveal that accounting for the economic operation of EVs leads to the integration of significantly higher capacities of RESs compared with a sizing model that excessively relies on V2G and does not recognize battery-fading economics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery fading; Distributed generation; Electric vehicle; Lithium-ion battery; Optimization","Charging (batteries); Distributed power generation; Electric vehicles; Electromagnetic wave emission; Integer programming; Microgrids; Optimization; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery fading; Battery performance; Economic operations; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Mixed integer linear programming; Renewable energy source; Vehicle integration; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Lithium-ion batteries; decision analysis; electric vehicle; energy resource; power generation; renewable resource; stochasticity; Japan; Okinawa Island; Okinawa Islands; Okinawa [Okinawa Island]; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Ryukyu Islands","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928346754"

Typical PEVs are charged single-phase up to 32 A (7.2-kVA) or tri-phase up to 32 A (22.0- kVA). Both charging technologies have to be discussed in order to determine their impact on planning and operating of low-voltage distribution grids to assure a reliable and stable PEV charging. Traditional grid planning and analysis methods, which average and evenly distribute PEV loads on the distribution grid, fail in providing a realistic answer about the grid capacity to charge PEVs. The question; How many PEVs can be charged simultaneously on a distribution grid remains unanswered. Therefore, this paper describes a novel methodology to realistically evaluate the grid capacity for PEV charging on 3-phase 0.4-kV distribution grids. The proposed methodology is a modified Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique, which analyzes grid capacity with respect to charging location, technical distribution grid limitations, and PEV charging techniques. The MC technique is numerically optimized to analyze large distribution grids and scaled up PEV charging.

They can be an integral part of a microgrid. Ground vehicles have become more electrified over time, providing electrical power for the propulsion system (hybrid) and a complex suite of auxiliary power systems, enhancing their use in microgrids. Optimizing the microgrid system for performance and reliability considering many external loads and sources is a challenging problem. This is especially true when the plug-in vehicles may enter and leave the microgrid randomly becoming either sources or loads. The microgrid is a repairable system. Recent work has shown that multiple metrics are needed to fully account for the performance of repairable systems under uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a decision-based framework to design and maintain repairable systems for optimal performance and reliability using a set of metrics such as minimum failure free period (MFFP), number of failures in planning horizon, and cost. Optimal tradeoffs among a minimal set of metrics (MSOM) can be used in the design and maintenance of these systems. The optimal solution includes the initial design, the system maintenance throughout the planning horizon, and the protocol to operate the system. Critical remote military installations with plug-in vehicles connected to the microgrids require careful consideration of cost and repair strategies because of logistical challenges in performing repairs and supplying necessary spare parts in unsafe locations. We show how a MSOM helps to solve the complex optimization problem of finding the best microgrid power management strategy considering performance, reliability, and cost. © 2015, American Society of Machenical Engineers.

The main objective is to minimize the hourly power system operation cost with a cleaner, socially responsible, and sustainable generation of electricity. Emission constraints are enforced to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional thermal generating units. The stationary electric vehicles (EV) are considered as an example of distributed storage and vehicle to grid (V2G) technology is considered to demonstrate the bilateral role of EV as supplier and consumer of energy. Battery storage can ease the impact of variability of renewable energy sources on power system operations and reduce the impact of thermal generation emission at peak hours. We model the day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems as a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem for solving the hourly security-constraint unit commitment (SCUC). In order to expedite the real-time solution for large-scale power systems, we consider a two-stage model of the hourly SCUC by applying the Benders decomposition (BD). The Benders decomposition would separate the hourly generation unit commitment (UC) in the master problem from the power network security check in subproblem. The subproblem would check dc network security constraints for the given UC solution to determine whether a converged and secure dc power flow can be obtained. If any power network violations arise, corresponding Benders cuts are formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will continue until the network violations are eliminated and a converged hourly solution is found for scheduling the power generating units. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MILP approach and its potentials as an optimization tool for sustainable operations of electric power grids. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite numerous advantages brought by the electrified transportation, it will place a profound impact on the power grids. However, the present EV planning studies have not paid enough attention to the grid impacts, concerns, and priorities. Therefore, a comprehensive multi-objective EV charging station planning framework is developed, which not only satisfies the EV users and the charging facility investors but which also maintains reliable grid operation. The voltage-dependent characteristic of the EV load has been taken into consideration. An index that is based on the system reactive power reserve has been introduced to compare relative voltage stability status in different cases. The proposed planning framework is tested and verified by building up a realistic case using EV prediction data and transportation data for the city of Brisbane.

A two-stage procedure has been considered to optimise PHEV charging station planning. In the first stage, the candidate locations and their size are determined based on: (i) the sum of benefits from the appropriate use of charging station for charging and discharging of vehicles and (ii) the benefit of providing spinning reserve and supplying the network's load demand at peak times by DSM. In the next stage, an improved framework is proposed to classify charging stations into efficient and inefficient sets characterised by non-financial indices. The proposed method is data envelopment analysis efficiency and three indices, including active power loss, voltage profile improvement and CO<inf>2</inf> emission.

Indeed, detailed treatment of PEV charging is necessary for efficient allocation of resources. It is envisaged that a coordinator of charging schedules, i.e., a PEV aggregator, could exercise some form of load control according to electricity market prices and network charges. In this context, it is important to consider the effects of uncertainty of key input parameters to optimization algorithms for PEV charging schedules. However, the modeling of the PEV aggregator's exposure to profit volatility has received less attention in detail. Hence, this paper develops a methodology to maximize PEV aggregator profits taking decisions in day-ahead and balancing markets while considering risk aversion. Under uncertain market prices and fleet mobility, the proposed two-stage linear stochastic program finds optimal PEV charging schedules at the vehicle level.

Based on statistical data, the Monte Carlo method is applied to determine the one-trip driven distance for the private EV. And by analyzing the EVs driving habit and the charging characteristics of EVs battery, we derive the initial state-of-charge (SOC) of charging, charging power and initial charging time. As a result, a more accurate mathematical model of computing the charging load accused by private EVs is proposed. Furthermore, the EVs charging loads in 2015 and 2020 are computed and compared in plug-in charging and wireless charging mode. The results of simulation show that the daily load peak of private EVs charging caused by wireless charging mode is significantly lower than that of plug-in charging mode.

The energy sector must anticipate and prepare for this extra demand and implement long-term planning for electricity production. In this paper, the additional electricity demand on the Ontario electricity grid from charging PHEVs is incorporated into an electricity production planning model. A case study pertaining to Ontario energy planning is considered to optimize the value of the cost of the electricity over sixteen years (2014-2030). The objective function consists of the fuel costs, fixed and variable operating and maintenance costs, capital costs for new power plants, and the retrofit costs of existing power plants. Five different case studies are performed with different PHEVs penetration rates, types of new power plants, and CO<inf>2</inf> emission constraints. Among all the cases studied, the one requiring the most new capacity, (~8748 MW), is assuming the base case with 6% reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> in year 2018 and high PHEV penetration. The next highest one is the base case, plus considering doubled NG prices, PHEV medium penetration rate and no CO<inf>2</inf> emissions reduction target with an increase of 34.78% in the total installed capacity in 2030. Furthermore, optimization results indicate that by not utilizing coal power stations the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions are the lowest: ~500 tonnes compared to ~900 tonnes when coal is permitted. © 2015 by the authors.","Carbon management; Energy planning; Forecasting; Mixed integer programing; Optimization; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Power plants","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Crashworthiness; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Forecasting; Hybrid vehicles; Integer programming; Optimization; Power plants; Production control; Vehicles; Carbon management; Electricity generation planning; Electricity production; Emission constraints; Energy planning; Mixed integer; Optimization modeling; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930787782"

Large integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in modern power system makes generation planning more complex. This paper presents the individual and collective impact of three distributed energy resources (DERs), namely, wind power generator as a renewable energy source, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and emergency demand response program (EDRP) on unit commitment. In this paper, an inconsistent nature of wind speed and wind power is characterized by the Weibull probability distribution function considering overestimation and underestimation cost model of the stochastic wind power. The extensive economic analysis of UC with DERs is carried out to attain the least total cost of the entire system. To obtain the optimum solution, Teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is employed to solve the unit commitment problem considering IEEE standard 10 unit test system in this study. It is found that the combined effect of wind power generator, plug-in electric vehicles and emergency demand response program on UC significantly lessen the total cost of the system. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed energy resources (DERs); Emergency demand response program (EDRP); Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs); Teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm; Unit commitment problem (UCP)","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Crashworthiness; Distribution functions; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Emergency services; Energy resources; Learning algorithms; Probability distributions; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vehicles; Weibull distribution; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Demand response programs; Distributed Energy Resources; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Teaching-learning-based optimizations; Unit commitment problem (UCP); Economic analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924087436"

An ever-increasing number of PEVs will radically change the traditional views of the power and transportation industries, the social environment, and the business world. The electrification of transportation brings both opportunities and challenges to existing critical infrastructures. This book chapter takes the position that the successful rollout of PEVs depends highly on the affordability, availability, and quality of the associated services that the nation's critical infrastructures can provide (e.g., a PEV charging facility at a parking lot).

In that context, this paper proposes a new methodology to enhance the security of power supply in a distribution network by strategically integrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) micro grids based on the nodal criticality. The nodal criticality is assessed by integrating operational uncertainties of events into samples of Monte Carlo simulation and then classifying load interruptions on the basis of their magnitudes and frequencies. The load shedding due to criticality of system stress is classified into arrays of clusters on the basis of magnitudes of interrupted loads. The critical clusters that provide the largest disturbances to nodal loads are used as the reference capacities of PHEV micro grids to mitigate impacts. Case studies are performed by applying the methodology into a realistic model of a distribution network. Results depict that the proposed methodology can improve the system-wide security of supply. There are some nodes of which the security of supply can be improved significantly. The levels of improvement in security of supply of nodes are not consistent and some nodes can also receive marginal improvements. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Distribution network planning; grid integration of renewables; Monte Carlo simulation; security of power supply","Computer simulation; Criticality (nuclear fission); Distributed power generation; Electric power systems; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Uncertainty analysis; Critical cluster; Distribution network planning; Grid integration; Network resource; Plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); Power supply; Security enhancements; Security of supply; Electric power distribution","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84919951629"

Whereas, its features of time mismatch with power demand and uncertainty pose barriers for the power system to utilize it effectively. Hence, a novel unit commitment model is proposed in this paper considering demand response and electric vehicles, which can promote the exploitation of wind power. On the one hand, demand response and electric vehicles have the feasibility to change the load demand curve to solve the mismatch problem. On the other hand, they can serve as reserve for wind power. To deal with the unit commitment problem, authors use a fuzzy chance-constrained program that takes into account the wind power forecasting errors. The numerical study shows that the model can promote the utilization of wind power evidently, making the power system operation more eco-friendly and economical. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
