	abstract = {The growing adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) poses significant challenges to electricity grids, especially in countries aiming for rapid decarbonization. This study evaluates the hourly impact of BEV integration on Italy's energy system using a Python-based simulation model. Two scenarios are analyzed for 2024: (1) 3.5 million BEVs and (2) 7 million BEVs. The model incorporates hourly charging profiles for household and highway fast-charging, Italy's renewable energy mix (solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy), and a 5 GWh battery energy storage system. Results show that Scenario 1 increases daily electricity demand by 19 % (to 1.1 TWh), with peak loads of 47–49 GW, requiring 152 GWh of thermal generation and emitting 76,000 tons of CO<inf>2</inf> daily. Scenario 2 raises demand by 40 % (to 1.25 TWh), with peak loads of 50–53 GW, 224 GWh of thermal generation, and 112,000 tons of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Existing storage mitigates 20 % of peak load but is insufficient for Scenario 2’s 15 GW shortfall. Key demand spikes occur at 01:00 and 11:00–18:00, coinciding with home and highway charging. Policy strategies such as time-of-use tariffs, expanding storage to 15 GWh, and doubling solar capacity could reduce emissions by up to 35 % and supply 80 % of BEV charging needs during daylight hours. This hourly-resolution analysis offers critical insights for grid planning and supports the EU's Fit for 55 targets. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the large-scale integration of renewable energy units and electric vehicles (EVs) into distribution networks, enhancing the power quality of these networks has emerged as a critical issue requiring immediate attention. Meanwhile, existing solution methods are inadequate for meeting the multi-objective optimization needs of distribution networks. This study establishes a bi-level collaborative optimization strategy for improving power quality in distribution networks. Specifically, the upper planning tier aims to minimize comprehensive costs through multi-component collaborative planning. The lower operational tier, based on the comprehensive performance evaluation decision model (CPEDM), conducts coordinated scheduling of multiple components by considering both economic benefits and power quality indicators. Furthermore, a fuzzy triple black hole multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOFTBH), which boasts high solution quality, uncertainty handling capabilities, and high adaptability, is developed and employed to solve the bi-level collaborative model. The study focuses on the IEEE-33 system as the research subject, leveraging the MOFTBH for analysis. Simulation results indicate that the optimization strategy presented in this study improves economic benefits and power quality by 45.43% and 19.90%, respectively, compared to the case without any optimization. Specifically, indices such as voltage deviation, voltage fluctuation, and harmonic distortion have improved by 39.01%, 127.45% and 113.14%, MOFTBH demonstrates a 30% faster Pareto front convergence rate compared to benchmark algorithms, with a 25% improvement in solution set uniformity. Under equivalent iteration counts, the objective function values show an optimization range of 18.7%–23.4%. This planning model aims to provide intelligent and green strategies for future smart grid construction and facilitate the commercial expansion of distribution network operators. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The continuous growth of electric vehicles (EVs) poses new challenges to power systems planning and operation due to the need to meet society's decarbonization goals. In this context, clustering has emerged as a powerful tool to help understand and categorize the uncertain behavior of EV users and the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) needs. However, previous studies lack empirical European EV charging data and relevance for practical applications.Therefore, to address such issues, this study evaluates different clustering techniques to identify typical EV charging profiles and, mainly, usage flexibility. The defined methodology comprises three major stages: data preprocessing, clustering application, and validation of results. We conduct benchmarking based on EV energy consumption, arrival, and sojourn times, using K-means, Gaussian mixture model, and Hierarchical clustering. This method allows greater applicability to various datasets from different regions, producing more comprehensive profiles that can provide empirical flexibility data in a visual, intuitive, and relevant approach.A use case considering EV charging data from Caltech University and Greece is utilized to test the proposed methods, demonstrating the versatility of our methodology.Specifically, Caltech features highly flexible prolonged charging sessions, while Greece exhibits quick-stay sessions with less flexibility potential. Both contexts offer opportunities to use the available flexibility for coordination with renewable energy sources and help balance the grid. This information unlocks the potential for future studies, enabling distribution system operators and charge point operators to intelligently and successfully integrate EVs into the energy system. © 2025 The Author(s)},

Current operations and maintenance models lack the flexibility to accommodate this increased variability and its effects on degradation, leading to more frequent start/stop cycles that significantly impact asset lifespans. In this paper, we propose a robust optimization framework designed to optimize generation maintenance schedules and unit commitment decisions in power systems. Our approach explicitly models the impact of start/stop cycling on remaining useful lifetime distributions, providing accurate failure risk assessments. By incorporating sensor-informed and decision-dependent degradation models within an operations and maintenance optimization model, our framework effectively balances lifetime utilization, failure risks, and operational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through computational experiments using real-world degradation signals, demonstrating its advantages over the benchmark models. © 2025},

	abstract = {Remote and off-grid Australian communities face persistent energy insecurity because of their dependence on diesel-based microgrids, which are both economically and environmentally unsustainable. This study proposes and comprehensively evaluates three Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) configurations, namely off-grid, off-grid with Vehicle-to-Home (V2H), and on-grid, integrating solar Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbines (WT), Battery Energy Storage (BES), and Electric Vehicles (EVs). It conducts a detailed techno-economic assessment of these configurations using a rule-based energy management strategy designed to identify the most balanced and sustainable design. A novel rule-based Energy Management System (EMS) is developed to enable real-time, degradation-aware dispatch that accounts for EV availability, battery and EV aging, and local renewable variability. The EMS is computationally efficient, transparent, and suitable for embedded control platforms operating in infrastructure-constrained microgrids. Using hourly simulations over a 20-year horizon with realistic solar, wind, residential load, and rural EV mobility datasets, this work assesses each configuration within a unified techno-economic, environmental, and social framework. Key performance indicators include Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), Return on Investment (ROI), lifecycle CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, employment creation, and Human Development Index (HDI) improvement. The off-grid system with V2H integration demonstrates the most balanced performance, achieving a 96.4 % renewable share, Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) of 0.00017, and a 91.2% reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions compared with the diesel baseline. It also reduces NPC to $199,235, shortens payback to 7.12 years, and increases ROI (0.755) and IRR (12.80%). The on-grid configuration achieves a lower LCOE (0.1010 $/kWh) but compromises energy autonomy and environmental performance. Sensitivity analysis identifies battery cost and project lifetime as the dominant influencing factors. Overall, this study provides a scalable and practical blueprint for resilient and inclusive energy access in remote regions, offering valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to integrate transport electrification with decentralized renewable-energy planning. © 2025 The Author.},

	abstract = {The transition to battery electric buses (BEBs) offers a promising pathway to decarbonize urban transport. However, planning their deployment requires careful evaluation of both economic and environmental trade-offs. This study presents a novel planning framework that jointly minimizes the total cost of ownership (TCO) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by optimizing onboard battery size, charger power, and number of chargers, while incorporating a detailed battery aging model to capture real-world degradation under varying temperatures and charging conditions. A comparative analysis is conducted across four cities-Singapore, Adelaide, Munich, and Calgary-each representing distinct climate profiles, electricity prices, and grid emission intensities. The study also evaluates three widely used lithium-ion battery chemistries: LFP, NMC, and NCA. Results reveal substantial variation in optimal BEB configurations across regions. Colder cities require larger batteries and higher charging power to maintain reliability, resulting in increased costs and emissions, while milder climates with cleaner grids support more cost-effective and sustainable solutions. Critically, the analysis demonstrates that no single configuration performs best across all locations or chemistries-underscoring that one-size-fits-all approaches are unsuitable for BEB planning. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and transit agencies aiming to deploy BEBs effectively under diverse regional conditions. © 2025 The Author(s)},

Thus, an improved approach called MCWOA (modified chaotic whale optimization algorithm) is proposed for optimal sizing of HRES by incorporating the Lévy Flight strategy into the chaotic whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The results obtained are compared with other standard optimization algorithms, like WOA, Chaotic WOA (CWOA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which indicate that MCWOA outperforms all the above-mentioned algorithms in terms of Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and reliability index, i.e., Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP). The LCOE of proposed HRES using MCWOA is found to be 1.1 %, 1.4 %, and 4.3 % lower compared to the obtained values using PSO, CWOA, and WOA, respectively. Similarly, the LPSP is 1.1 %, 1.8 % and 2.4 % lower compared to the obtained values using PSO, CWOA, and WOA, respectively.

The existing planning methods also lack an assessment of hydrogen supply strategies. To address these challenges, this study proposes a bi-level optimization model for HRS planning and operation considering traffic-power coupling. The upper-level model establishes a multi-objective framework based on spatiotemporal hydrogen demand forecasting, aiming to minimize total system cost and power grid voltage fluctuations while maximizing user satisfaction. The lower-level model optimizes operational decisions by minimizing hydrogen total usage costs, explicitly evaluating the economic and environmental impacts of various hydrogen supply sources. Case studies are conducted using the real road network of Kunming city coupled with extended IEEE-118 system. The model is solved using a combination of the NSGA-III and Gurobi. The optimal solution yields a comprehensive cost of 5.4735 million RMB, user satisfaction of 0.778, and voltage fluctuation of 0.0035 p.u. Moreover, the lower-level results confirm that, under the premise of prioritizing green hydrogen, the multi-source hydrogen supply strategy offers significantly superior cost efficiency compared to single-source solutions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

This study optimizes the placement and sizing of solar photovoltaic-battery system (PV-BESS) in Nepal's 30-bus Byasi feeder to mitigate these issues. Employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) and MATLAB/Simulink, the proposed approach reduces active power loss by 56.18 % (477 kW–209 kW) and improves minimum bus voltage by 2.57 % (0.9404–0.9646 p.u.) through integration of 2576 kW PV and 1311 kW BESS.
