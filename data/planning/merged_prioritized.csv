maybe,,"A holistic review of electric vehicle charging impacts on power distribution networks: Technical challenges, smart mitigation strategies and future directions","Electric Vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a pivotal solution in the global transition toward sustainable transportation, offering significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. The growing adoption of EVs is anticipated to significantly influence electrical power distribution networks. As EV adoption accelerates worldwide, their integration into existing electrical distribution networks poses considerable challenges, particularly concerning load demand, voltage stability. Recent research has increasingly focused on understanding and mitigating these impacts, through a wide array of analytical, simulation-based, and data-driven methods both with and without the implementation of network management strategies. However, a comprehensive, integrated synthesis of these studies linking technical findings with mitigation strategies and practical implications is still limited. Additionally, there is a lack of a thorough review consolidating the existing research on this subject, which is essential for understanding the scope of prior studies. Motivated by this gap, this review paper provides a critical and consolidated examination of the current literature on the impacts of EV on distribution networks. The paper's objective is to assess the comprehensive effects of EV integration and evaluate mitigation strategies across three core domains: network management, EV and Distributed generation (DG) coordination, and regulated charging solutions. The paper also introduces the role of artificial intelligence in enabling predictive, adaptive, and scalable solutions. It highlights key methodologies, data sources, modeling approaches, and the efficacy of various solutions while identifying prevailing research gaps and future directions, including real-time co-simulation, techno-economic assessments, and hybrid planning frameworks. Key outcomes of this study include a unified framework for understanding EV interactions with the grid and distribution network, a comparative analysis of mitigation approaches, and a set of recommendations for advancing research and deployment strategies. These findings aim to inform stakeholders about the latest advancements and support decision-making. The findings are particularly beneficial for utility providers, network planners, policymakers, charging infrastructure developers, and researchers seeking to develop robust, data-informed strategies for managing EV impacts and guide them in addressing unresolved challenges. © 2025 The Authors",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126961,2026,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126961,18,high
maybe,,A machine learning approach for EVCS integration in distribution network based on optimal investment actions,"Achieving the European climate targets for 2050 requires the large-scale integration of electric vehicles and public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). This energy transition requires the reinforcement planning of the electrical infrastructure to ensure the quality of supply for the next years. Distribution operators need efficient planning tools able to evaluate reinforcement actions for each new connection of EVCS in MV distribution networks. This paper presents a Machine Learning (ML) approach for optimal EVCS allocation based on the Mixed Integer Second Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) formulation. First, a formulation for distribution network operational planning based on an MISOCP model is presented. This formulation aims to minimize total investments while considering operational constraints, the branch flow model, passive and active decision variables. Secondly, a large set of expansion scenarios are solved based on a sensitivity analysis and then used as training data for supervised learning models, allowing them to learn the mapping between scenario inputs and optimal investment outcomes. The strength of the trained model is the fast and accurate predictions of optimal reinforcement actions and investments from unseen new EVCS expansion scenarios, opening new opportunities for efficient large-scale EVCS assessments. Results on a 124-bus MV Network show that decision tree-based models can predict reinforcement actions and investments with a deviation of less than 1%. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.epsr.2025.112376,2026,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2025.112376,18,high
maybe,,Clustering methodologies for flexibility characterization of electric vehicles supply equipment,"The continuous growth of electric vehicles (EVs) poses new challenges to power systems planning and operation due to the need to meet society's decarbonization goals. In this context, clustering has emerged as a powerful tool to help understand and categorize the uncertain behavior of EV users and the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) needs. However, previous studies lack empirical European EV charging data and relevance for practical applications.Therefore, to address such issues, this study evaluates different clustering techniques to identify typical EV charging profiles and, mainly, usage flexibility. The defined methodology comprises three major stages: data preprocessing, clustering application, and validation of results. We conduct benchmarking based on EV energy consumption, arrival, and sojourn times, using K-means, Gaussian mixture model, and Hierarchical clustering. This method allows greater applicability to various datasets from different regions, producing more comprehensive profiles that can provide empirical flexibility data in a visual, intuitive, and relevant approach.A use case considering EV charging data from Caltech University and Greece is utilized to test the proposed methods, demonstrating the versatility of our methodology.Specifically, Caltech features highly flexible prolonged charging sessions, while Greece exhibits quick-stay sessions with less flexibility potential. Both contexts offer opportunities to use the available flexibility for coordination with renewable energy sources and help balance the grid. This information unlocks the potential for future studies, enabling distribution system operators and charge point operators to intelligently and successfully integrate EVs into the energy system. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.geits.2025.100304,2026,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.geits.2025.100304,18,high

Meanwhile, existing solution methods are inadequate for meeting the multi-objective optimization needs of distribution networks. This study establishes a bi-level collaborative optimization strategy for improving power quality in distribution networks. Specifically, the upper planning tier aims to minimize comprehensive costs through multi-component collaborative planning. The lower operational tier, based on the comprehensive performance evaluation decision model (CPEDM), conducts coordinated scheduling of multiple components by considering both economic benefits and power quality indicators. Furthermore, a fuzzy triple black hole multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOFTBH), which boasts high solution quality, uncertainty handling capabilities, and high adaptability, is developed and employed to solve the bi-level collaborative model. The study focuses on the IEEE-33 system as the research subject, leveraging the MOFTBH for analysis. Simulation results indicate that the optimization strategy presented in this study improves economic benefits and power quality by 45.43% and 19.90%, respectively, compared to the case without any optimization. Specifically, indices such as voltage deviation, voltage fluctuation, and harmonic distortion have improved by 39.01%, 127.45% and 113.14%, MOFTBH demonstrates a 30% faster Pareto front convergence rate compared to benchmark algorithms, with a 25% improvement in solution set uniformity. Under equivalent iteration counts, the objective function values show an optimization range of 18.7%–23.4%.

This study optimizes the placement and sizing of solar photovoltaic-battery system (PV-BESS) in Nepal's 30-bus Byasi feeder to mitigate these issues. Employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) and MATLAB/Simulink, the proposed approach reduces active power loss by 56.18 % (477 kW–209 kW) and improves minimum bus voltage by 2.57 % (0.9404–0.9646 p.u.) through integration of 2576 kW PV and 1311 kW BESS. The application of novel energy management strategy further curtails peak demand by 38.3 % (3700 kW–2283 kW). The solution achieves financial viability with approximately 9-year payback period. This research pioneers a comprehensive technical-operational-economic assessment for EV charging-oriented PV-BESS planning in Nepal's RDS, demonstrating how weighted multi-objective optimization balances power loss reduction and voltage improvement while ensuring economic feasibility.

The existing planning methods also lack an assessment of hydrogen supply strategies. To address these challenges, this study proposes a bi-level optimization model for HRS planning and operation considering traffic-power coupling. The upper-level model establishes a multi-objective framework based on spatiotemporal hydrogen demand forecasting, aiming to minimize total system cost and power grid voltage fluctuations while maximizing user satisfaction. The lower-level model optimizes operational decisions by minimizing hydrogen total usage costs, explicitly evaluating the economic and environmental impacts of various hydrogen supply sources. Case studies are conducted using the real road network of Kunming city coupled with extended IEEE-118 system. The model is solved using a combination of the NSGA-III and Gurobi. The optimal solution yields a comprehensive cost of 5.4735 million RMB, user satisfaction of 0.778, and voltage fluctuation of 0.0035 p.u. Moreover, the lower-level results confirm that, under the premise of prioritizing green hydrogen, the multi-source hydrogen supply strategy offers significantly superior cost efficiency compared to single-source solutions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.renene.2025.124459,2026,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2025.124459,18,high
maybe,,Robust Expansion Planning of Distribution Network in Presence of Electric Vehicles to Improve Economic Parameters and Reduce Energy Consumption,"First-world countries and underdeveloped countries share concerns regarding global warming, climate change, and climate migration. Hence, one of the greatest issues faced by governments in the present day is to effectively control the escalating pace of climate change and achieve equilibrium since it directly impacts the future. The fate of the human race hinges on this matter. One of the contributors to the production of pollutants and global warming is the use of cars based on nonrenewable fuel. Consequently, most governments must eliminate fossil fuel vehicles and substitute them with electric vehicles (EV) as part of their short-term and long-term goals. However, the growing adoption of EVs has made it crucial for operators and network designers to strategically plan for electric power consumption, adapt the distribution network structure, and accurately determine the optimal number and positioning of charging stations. Thus, this paper utilizes a convex solution method based on integer linear programming to effectively plan the expansion of the distribution network considering the availability of EV charging stations, compensators, substations, resources, and new lines. This article aims to minimize the long-term expenses associated with constructing network infrastructure, subtransmission substations, EV charging stations, building sources, capacitor banks, and procuring power from the upstream network. The YALMIP toolbox in MATLAB software was utilized to model and solve the objective function of this problem, which is expressed in both deterministic and nondeterministic versions. The MOSEK solver was employed as the problem-solving tool. Three scenarios were implemented to plan the growth of the network on the 18-bus bus system. The results indicate that having EV charging stations in the network can be advantageous as it improves reliability and reduces network costs. © 2025 The Author(s).

The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces significant challenges to power distribution network stability due to their aggregated charging load in residential areas, particularly during peak electricity consumption periods. This paper proposes a method to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of EV charging demand in residential areas using geographic information points of interest (POI) data features and a decision-making model. Utilizing real historical data, probability distribution models for EV users' arrival times and charging characteristics were constructed using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The spatiotemporal characteristics of EV travel and charging behaviors were analyzed, and a comprehensive charging decision model incorporating both emergency and stochastic scenarios was developed. The model's efficacy in capturing the probability distributions of characteristic variables was validated through a case study.

maybe,,Reliability-constrained transmission expansion planning based on simultaneous forecasting method of loads and renewable generations,"Due to increased energy consumption in upcoming years, the power system needs to be expanded to meet suitable technical conditions. The primary requirement is to gain accurate information about consumption growth in the planning horizon, which can be obtained via forecast studies. Since renewable sources can grow beside the demand, the accurate prediction should consider simultaneous changes in supply and demand in the future. In this paper, a reliability-constrained transmission expansion planning (RCTEP) is proposed. It simultaneously is based on the load forecasting and renewable sources production, named the net power demand forecasting technique (NPDFT). NPDFT consists of a time series-based logistic method, which forecasts loads at planning years. RES generation forecasting forecasts the following year's generation by an estimated coefficient. RCTEP minimizes the summation of the planning, operation, and reliability cost so that it is limited to the AC optimal power flow equations, planning constraints, and reliability limitations for N - 1 contingency. Then, the stochastic programming based on the Monte Carlo Simulation and the simultaneous backward approach models the uncertainties of the load, RES power, and availability of network equipment. This problem is solved by the hybrid algorithm of grey wolf optimization and training and learning optimization algorithm to achieve the securable optimal solution with a low standard deviation. Generally, this paper contributes to predicting the net power demand, simultaneous modeling of operation, reliability, and economic indices, besides using hybrid algorithms to solve the defined problem. Finally, this strategy is implemented on the 3-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus transmission networks in MATLAB software. The numerical results confirm the capabilities of the proposed method in improving network operation and reliability indices. Higher reliability can be found for the network by defining a desirable penalty price.

The HAVOGO algorithm combines the robustness of the African vulture optimizer with the adaptability of genetic operators, resulting in superior optimization performance. The algorithm focuses on the simultaneous sizing and locating of distributed generation and distribution static compensator, alongside network reconfiguration, to efficiently incorporate electric vehicle charging stations into existing power distribution networks. A multi-objective optimization framework is utilized to allocate power compensating devices and optimize network reconfiguration, considering both technical and economic factors. The effectiveness of the HAVOGO algorithm is demonstrated through its application to 118-bus and 415-bus large distribution networks. Additionally, the results obtained from the HAVOGO algorithm are compared with those from other optimization algorithms and existing research in the field. Numerical results show significant improvements in performance metrics for both network sizes: for the 118-bus system, there is a reduction in active power loss by 84.72%, a decrease in voltage deviation by 76.22%, and an increase in voltage stability margin by 62.99%.

maybe,,Bi-level stochastic optimization model of smart distribution grids considering the transmission network to reduce vulnerability,"This paper presents a novel optimization framework for integrating transmission and distribution networks. The proposed framework consists of a bi-level optimization model, which comprises an upper-level problem and a lower-level problem. The upper-level problem addresses unit commitment (UC) in the transmission network, aiming to minimize operating costs and load shedding. It is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). Meanwhile, the lower-level problem focuses on the optimal operation of the distribution network, considering both renewable and non-renewable resources, as well as electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS). This problem is formulated as a linear model with the objectives of reducing power purchase costs from the transmission network and maximizing the utilization of renewable energy and EVCS charging power. The literature review highlights three main research gaps. Firstly, it is crucial to develop a convex model that ensures globally optimal solutions. Secondly, considering the problem-solving time, it is important to devise a method that can achieve globally optimal solutions in the shortest possible time, accounting for the dimensions, number of variables, and parameters involved in coordinating the transmission and distribution networks. Lastly, there is a need to develop a modeling approach that allows the integration of any number of distribution networks with the transmission network. To address these research gaps, we propose a solution methodology that involves rewriting the optimization problems using reformulation and decomposition methods. This approach enables the modeling of globally optimal solutions while ensuring faster solution times and the ability to incorporate numerous distribution networks into the transmission network. We validate the proposed model and methodology using various networks, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in coordinating the operation of transmission and smart distribution networks. The simulation results indicate that our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches. Specifically, the results show that the proposed approach effectively mitigates load interruptions in the distribution networks when renewable and non-renewable resources experience interruptions in each system. As a direct consequence, the vulnerability of the distribution networks has significantly diminished, showcasing the robustness and resilience of our approach to handling resource interruptions. Notably, the proposed approach is 40% faster than the KKT method and 20% faster than the evolutionary method, with approximately 8% more optimal results than the evolutionary method, demonstrating its superior coordination for integrated transmission and distribution networks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.",10.1007/s12667-023-00628-6,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s12667-023-00628-6,18,high

It presents a multi-stage, multi-objective optimization algorithm to determine the battery energy storage system (BESS) specifications required to support the infrastructure. The algorithm results in the minimum BESS capacity and power rating required, subject to the various specific constraints to comply with distribution grid power quality standards by limiting the peak grid demand whilst taking into account several factors over one day, i.e., daily traffic patterns (used to estimate charging system demand), and details of the local electricity network (demand patterns). The optimization method was demonstrated using actual data from an intercity highway and electricity distribution network in a remote highway mid-way between two cities in New South Wales, Australia.

maybe,,Potential impact of controlled electric car charging and vehicle-to-grid on Germany's future power system,"The increasing diffusion of electric vehicles contributes to a growing electricity demand in the coming years. At the same time, this integrates millions of mobile storage units into the electricity system, which has a rising need for flexibility to balance the intermittent generation from photovoltaic systems and wind turbines. To capture the potential of electric cars as a flexibility resource, we simulate 7,000 vehicle driving profiles in an agent-based model, generating load profiles as well as charging power and state-of-charge boundaries for the German car fleet, which serve as restrictions in energy system optimization. In a scenario-based study for Germany in 2030 and 2045, we compare the installed electric capacities in the optimized system, depending on whether electric vehicle charging is uncontrolled, controlled, or bidirectional. Here we show that a bidirectionally charged car fleet has the potential to replace 32 GW (84 %) of stationary battery storage and 31 GW (64 %) of hydrogen-fired peaking power plants, while enabling an additional solar power expansion of 7 GW (2 %) until 2045. Notably, implementing vehicle-to-grid can limit hydrogen-fired electricity generation to winter months and enable a shift toward combined heat and power plants. On the demand side, it can reduce the expansion of electrolyzers by 19 GW (28 %) and power-to-heat capacities by 25 GW (60 %). Overall, the integrated energy system can substantially benefit from the implementation of smart and especially bidirectional charging as it lowers the need for future capacity expansion in the electricity system but also in coupled hydrogen and heat systems. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.adapen.2025.100227,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.adapen.2025.100227,18,high
maybe,,Fully distributed planning method for coordinated distribution and urban transportation networks considering three-phase unbalance mitigation,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are regarded as one of the silver bullets for addressing the global climate warming issue due to their zero‑carbon emission. However, the proliferation of EVs increases the demand on distribution network (DN), which already face challenges due to three-phase asymmetrical loads and impedance mismatches. The combination of charging demand and traditional three-phase loads aggravated the nodal voltage imbalance within DN. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a coordinated planning model for a three-phase unbalanced distribution network (TUDN) and urban transportation network (UTN). The model optimizes the placement of fast charging stations (FCS), line expansions, and road enhancements, using a distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) strategy to improve charging traffic flow (CTF) and reduce voltage imbalances. To ensure privacy encryption, a fully distributed framework using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is designed to solve this problem, where a two-layer iterative process (TIP) is further developed to improve the convergence of ADMM, taking into account the integer variables in the model.

maybe,,A two-layer economic resilience model for distribution network restoration after natural disasters,"Improving the resilience of energy networks and minimizing outages is crucial, making the development of self-healing strategies essential for ensuring a continuous power supply and boosting resilience. As decentralized prosumers become more integrated into smart grids, innovative coordination methods are required to fully leverage their potential and improve the system's self-healing capabilities. Hence, in this paper, we present a decentralized two-layer model for active distribution networks (ADNs) incorporating commercial energy hubs, Parking lots (PLs), hydrogen refueling stations, and mobile units (MUs). This model aims to maximize the flexible capacities of flexible prosumers under emergencies and includes a dynamic mechanism for transporting hydrogen to refueling stations via trucks. In the first layer of the model, the AND operator provides the required services to flexible prosumers, including commercial energy hubs, PLs and hydrogen refueling stations. During this layer, the movement paths of mobile units, such as battery-based mobile storage units (MSUs) and mobile hydrogen units (MHUs), are determined. In the second layer, prosumers independently plan and decide the extent of their service contributions. Subsequently, with the actual service capacities established, the AND operator re-optimizes the initial planning to finalize the system schedule and precise movement paths of the mobile units. The proposed model was tested on a modified 83-bus distribution network using the CPLEX solver in GAMS.

The review of the literature indicates that the operational planning of EVCSs integrated in distribution systems has not received enough attention; on the other hand, it is crucial to push EVCSs, HFSs and distribution systems towards 100 % renewable systems; so, in this research, the aim is to build a framework for the integration of emission-free EVCSs and HFSs in emission-free distribution systems considering their impact on transmission system operator. The Case study is the IEEE 57-bus transmission system connected to three 33-bus distribution systems, integrated with EVCSs and HFSs. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models are used for EVs, FCVs, HFSs, EVCSs and transmission system, while Mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQCP) model is used for distribution system. According to the results, the expected profits of distribution systems 1–3 are respectively $3509.41, $3550.27 and $3685.13. The expected cost of transmission system is as high as $1,818,020. The results show that due to PV modules and storage systems, the operation of all EVCSs and HFSs is profitable. The results show that the operation of all DSs is profitable; indeed, due to the existence of PV and wind generators which have no operation cost, the revenue of DSs is higher than their cost. The results also show that batteries increase the expected profit of EVCSs by 475 %. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124630,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124630,18,high
maybe,,Efficient allocation of capacitors and vehicle-to-grid integration with electric vehicle charging stations in radial distribution networks,"Electric vehicles offer zero tailpipe emissions and effectively reduce the release of harmful pollutants, which are significant contributors to air pollution and climate changes. However, the increased adoption of electric vehicles presents challenges to the power grid and could create a surge in demand characterized by fast-absorbing electrical energy. This surge can affect voltage profiles and escalate energy losses within distribution lines. This study introduces an optimization framework leveraging parallel search real-coded genetic algorithms (PSRCGA) for the efficient allocation and sizing of fast charging stations, vehicle-to-grid integration, and capacitors utilization. The optimization aims to enhance grid profitability by minimizing capacitor costs and optimizing power quality metrics through a multi-objective function. Various constraints such as power balance, bus voltage, current flow limits, and capacitor bank specifications are considered in the optimization process. By employing the PSRCGA, the study proposes a fitness function that effectively incorporates the objective function with the constraints. The proposed framework is validated through diverse scenarios applied to IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems, showcasing its efficacy in optimizing system performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124745,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124745,18,high
maybe,,Real-time hosting capacity assessment for electric vehicles: A sequential forecast-then-optimize method,"Hosting capacity (HC) assessment for electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for EV secure integration and reliable power system operation. Existing methods primarily focus on a long-term perspective (e.g., system planning), and consider the EV charging demands as scalar values, which introduces inaccuracies in real-time operations due to the inherently stochastic nature of EVs. In this regard, this paper proposes a real-time HC assessment method for EVs through a three-step process, involving real-time probabilistic forecasting, risk analysis and probabilistic optimization. Specifically, we conduct real-time probabilistic forecasting to capture the stochastic nature of EV charging demands across multiple charging stations by performing deterministic forecasting and fitting the distribution of forecasting errors. The deterministic forecasting is conducted using an adaptive spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN). ASTGCN leverages adaptive spatial feature extraction, attention-based temporal feature extraction, and second-order graph representation to improve the forecasting performance. Subsequently, based on the probabilistic forecasting of EV charging demands, we conduct real-time risk analysis and operational boundary identification by utilizing probabilistic power flow calculations to assess potential violations of secure operational constraints. Furthermore, we present the formulation of real-time HC of EVs considering expected satisfaction of stochastic EV charging demands, and propose an optimization model for real-time HC assessment of EVs. Numerical experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed ASTGCN model outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models by achieving the lowest root mean square error of 0.0442, and the real-time HC is improved by 64% compared to long-term HC assessment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125034,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125034,18,high

This paper tackles the complex challenge of accurately estimating charging demand over time while considering the impacts of transportation networks and power grids. We first develop a traffic assignment model and design an algorithm based on the Frank-Wolfe method to calculate user equilibrium traffic flow for each link in the transportation network. By leveraging this flow, we enhance demand estimation through a mapping function that provides more precise estimates of EV charging demand. Recognizing the uncertainties in charging demand, we formulate a multi-stage robust adaptive expansion model for EV charging stations to allow for adjustments as demand evolves. This model aims to maximize the total profit of charging station operators by determining the optimal number of charging piles across multiple stages. To solve this optimization problem, we design an algorithm based on the partition-and-bound method with finite adaptability to effectively balance computational efficiency with optimization performance.

maybe,,Resilience enhancement for power distribution networks in coordination with electric vehicle fleets,"With the global shift towards decarbonized transportation, the adoption of company-owned electric vehicle (EV) fleets is rapidly increasing worldwide. This paper explores the potential of these EV fleets to enhance resilience in power distribution networks through strategic charging station planning and effective post-disaster restoration. Towards this end, a tri-level optimization model is proposed to tackle i) the optimal location problem for charging stations considering grid resilience, and ii) the post-disaster restoration challenge by incentivizing EV fleets for backup power provision. Specifically, multiple performance indices are proposed within the coupled network to facilitate optimal charging station deployment. In addition, an advanced choice model is constructed to analyze the behavioral tendencies of fleet operators. To resolve the proposed model, an accelerated nested column-and-constraint generation (A-NC&CG) algorithm is presented.

maybe,,Evaluating the carbon-emission reduction potential of employing low-carbon demand response to guide electric-vehicle charging: A Chinese case study,"The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has resulted in considerable indirect carbon emissions from power systems. To reduce charging emissions, EVs should be charged strategically to consume generated renewable energy electricity. To achieve this goal, a low-carbon demand response model is proposed to stimulate multi-type EV users to consume more low-carbon electricity by guiding users to adjust their charging behaviour temporally and spatially. First, the charging flexibility of EVs is modelled considering different user behaviours and charging modes. To accurately guide the EV demand response, a method is proposed to calculate future carbon emission factors with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Considering the carbon emission factors, charging flexibility is integrated into a model for a low-carbon demand response. This model holistically optimizes fast and slow charging of EVs from the user's perspective. Case studies are carried out using real-world data and future planning results for Changzhou and China. The results indicate that EVs produce 73 % less carbon emissions during driving than traditional gasoline vehicles. Using low-carbon demand response to guide EV charging could reduce carbon emissions by up to 15 % by 2035. © 2025",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126196,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126196,18,high
maybe,,A tri-level planning strategy for integrated power and transport systems incorporating EV elastic charging behaviors,"With the rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, there is an escalating need for coordinated planning between power and transportation systems to address the additional stress on urban infrastructure. This study tackles the critical challenge of aligning investment and planning between these systems, specifically considering the impact of EV charging behaviors. To address this issue, we propose a novel tri-level optimization framework that incorporates a quasi-variational inequality (QVI) model to effectively capture the interactions between user equilibrium (UE) in transportation networks and elastic EV charging demand. The upper level of the model optimizes investments in power systems, including distributed generation and charging infrastructure. The middle level concentrates on expanding road capacity, while the lower level resolves the traffic flow patterns under user equilibrium with elastic charging behaviors (UE-ECB) using the QVI approach. By transforming the tri-level model into a bi-level optimization program with quasi-variational inequality (OP-QVI) formulation, we achieve computational tractability and provide efficient solutions. Results show that the elastic charging demand model outperforms the non-elastic assumption, reducing total costs by 22.2 %, with power system investments down by 19.1 % and transportation system investments down by 39.8 %. These findings demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, avoiding the overestimation of infrastructure needs. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm efficiently solves complex integrated planning problems, ensuring both computational effectiveness and economic viability in system-wide optimization. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126207,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126207,18,high
maybe,,Planning of a multi-agent mobile robot-based adaptive charging network for enhancing power system resilience under extreme conditions,"The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) poses escalating challenges to voltage stability in modern distribution systems, especially under extreme conditions (e.g., sudden load surges, generator failures, or network disruptions). Conventional fixed charging stations (FCS) lack flexibility, failing to adapt to the spatiotemporally dynamic and heterogeneous nature of EV charging demand, thereby exacerbating grid resilience risks. To address this, we propose a dual-mode multi-agent mobile robot-based adaptive charging network (MRACN) that enhances power system resilience through real-time, intelligent coordination of mobile charging resources. Our dynamic scheduling strategy enables MRACN units to switch seamlessly between cost-optimized dispatch during normal operations and resilience-driven prioritization during emergencies, guided by a real-time voltage stability index (VSI)-derived resilience coefficient. The framework combines a power-traffic co-simulation environment modelling urban congestion, heterogeneous EV mobility (private, taxi, fleet), and spatiotemporal demand variations, and a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model optimizing energy cost, customer satisfaction, and voltage stability under realistic constraints (traffic delays, mobility restrictions, grid safety margins). Simulations on a coupled IEEE 33-bus distribution system and 32-node transportation network demonstrate MRACN's superiority in enhancing voltage resilience, reducing operational costs, and improving EV service reliability across both normal and extreme grid scenarios. The results validate MRACN as a scalable, adaptive solution for resilient smart grids in EV-dominated environments. © 2025",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126252,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126252,18,high
maybe,,Low-carbon traffic resilience-enhanced robust planning of coupled transportation and power distribution network based on modified user equilibrium model,"As the global climate change problem becomes increasingly serious, carbon reduction has become the focus of attention of all countries. Electric vehicles (EVs), as a low-carbon alternative to traditional gas vehicles (GVs), have developed rapidly in recent years, promoting the coupling between the transportation network (TN) and the power distribution network (PDN). However, this deepening will amplify the impact of road disasters on the coupled system and cause more serious economic losses. Therefore, this paper introduces a comprehensive multi-stage tri-level robust planning of coupled transportation and power distribution network (CTPDN) to systemically enhance traffic resilience and reduce carbon emissions, aiming to minimize investment, traffic, carbon emission and power network costs under uncertain road damage conditions and other uncertainties. Firstly, a modified mixed user equilibrium model is proposed to characterize the behavior of EVs and GVs, which incorporates a unique EV path filtering mechanism and traffic resilience-enhancement characteristics. Then, a carbon-oriented optimal traffic-power flow (OTPF) model is developed to characterize the operation of CTPDN, which takes the carbon emission flow (CEF) into consideration, thereby achieving low-carbon objectives and highlighting the environmental benefits of EVs. An effective solution algorithm, BD-C&CG, is designed to solve this tri-level robust CTPDN planning problem. The proposed planning model is demonstrated using a coupled 33-node PDN and firstly a 12-node TN and then a 47-node TN. Numerical results validate its effectiveness. Furthermore, the advantages of the proposed modified mixed UE model are also verified, reducing 5.89 % travel failure rate. Sensitivity analyses show the effectiveness of the proposed BD-C&CG algorithm and the impact of carbon pricing. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126258,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126258,18,high
maybe,,Microgrid sizing with EV flexibility: Cascaded MILP and embedded APSO-MILP approaches,"The optimization of microgrid sizing and energy management (EM) presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of decision variables and constraints. This study addresses these challenges by proposing two distinct optimization algorithms aimed at enhancing microgrid component sizing and EM efficiency. The first approach, a cascaded Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) methodology, operates in two distinct stages. In the first stage, an annual optimization over 8760 h determines the optimal sizes of microgrid components and their energy management strategies, excluding electric vehicle (EV) flexibility to reduce computational complexity. This stage employs a single MILP formulation where both investment and operational decisions are jointly optimized. The second stage conducts a series of 24-h MILP optimizations for each day of the year, incorporating EV flexibility as a decision variable. This structure allows for refined energy management that adapts to daily variations in renewable generation, EV availability, and demand, while preserving the long-term sizing decisions established in the first stage. The second approach, an embedded Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization-MILP (APSO-MILP) algorithm, performs an iterative 24-h optimization across the entire year, inherently integrating EV flexibility into both sizing and operational decisions. In this hybrid framework, APSO is responsible for exploring optimal capacity configurations for the microgrid components, while MILP handles detailed daily energy management for each capacity set. By coupling the global search capability of APSO with the precision of MILP under linear constraints, this approach ensures more adaptive and accurate system sizing. The embedded structure enables the algorithm to continuously update and refine component sizes and operational strategies based on performance feedback, thereby achieving improved cost and emission outcomes over the full operational timeline. Both algorithms seek to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and Life Cycle Emissions (LCE) over the microgrid's operational lifespan. The microgrid under study consists of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, a battery energy storage system (BESS), power converters, and an electric grid connection serving both EV charging stations and university building loads. Additionally, both optimization strategies account for battery degradation and load shedding, incorporating the Value of Lost Load (VoLL) as a constraint. Results indicate that the embedded APSO-MILP algorithm outperforms the cascaded MILP approach, significantly reducing LCOE and LCE–by approximately 194 % and 520 %, respectively—when considering load shedding and EV flexibility. Moreover, the APSO-MILP approach effectively prevents load shedding across all scenarios, whereas the cascaded MILP method experiences occasional shedding under constrained conditions. Both algorithms highlight the seasonal dependency of energy sources, with increased reliance on energy injections from the grid during autumn and winter, underscoring the importance of BESS in maintaining energy balance. This study provides a comparative evaluation of two advanced optimization techniques for microgrid planning, demonstrating the critical role of EV flexibility and integrated optimization in reducing both economic and environmental costs. The findings offer valuable insights for decision-makers seeking to optimize microgrid configurations while ensuring cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and energy reliability. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126273,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126273,18,high
maybe,,Multi-objective optimization framework for strategic placement of electric vehicle charging stations and shunt capacitors in a distribution network considering traffic flow,"This study aims to develop a comprehensive multi-objective planning framework for the optimal placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and Shunt Capacitors (SCs) in the distribution network (DN) while accounting for transportation network (TN) constraints. The integration of EVCS into DN, though essential for promoting electric vehicle (EV) adoption, can result in voltage deviations and power losses. To address these challenges, a Traffic Flow Capturing model is employed to maximize EV traffic flow and minimize active power loss (APL) and voltage deviation (VD). A novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (HGPC), combining Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Cuckoo Search Optimization (CO), is proposed to solve the multi-objective problem. The framework is validated on a 33-node DN and 25-node TN across three planning scenarios: DN-focused, TN-focused, and integrated TN-DN. In the DN-focused scenario, the objective is to minimize power loss, whereas in the TN-focused scenario, the goal is to maximize EV flow. In the integrated planning case, with battery constraints, the model achieves 155.05 kW APL and 41.54 % EV flow; without constraints, it improves to 148.14 kW APL and 57.52 % EV flow. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed HGPC algorithm, suggesting greater flexibility in handling conflicting multi-objective functions and highlighting the benefits of integrated planning for sustainable EV infrastructure. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126284,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126284,18,high
maybe,,Online electric vehicle charging detection based on memory-based transformer using smart meter data,"The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) presents significant challenges for electricity grid management, particularly in accurately identifying EV charging patterns to optimize distribution network planning. Most recent works focus on EV load forecasting for future grid planning and do not take into account real-time EV charging identification. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised memory-based transformer (M-TR) model for real-time detection of EV charging events from streaming smart meter data. The proposed method is designed for deployment by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) and can be integrated into smart grid management systems to enhance grid stability and demand response strategies. The M-TR model leverages an encoder-decoder architecture: the encoder captures coarse-scale historical patterns over an extended temporal window, while the decoder focuses on fine-scale details within a local window. A key innovation of this approach is the dual memory comparison mechanism, which enables faster real-time inference by dynamically integrating historical and recent data. Unlike existing methods, the M-TR requires no prior knowledge of EV charging profiles and only uses real power consumption data from non-EV users. The goal of this approach is to automatically identify EV charging events from behind the meter aggregated smart meter data without requiring labeled EV data or additional sensors, thereby enabling real-time monitoring, reducing grid uncertainties, and supporting load balancing strategies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art unsupervised models, the M-TR achieves superior performance with an average F-score of 0.844 and an AUC of 0.910, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the model's efficient execution time of 1.2 s per 1-min data sample highlights its suitability for real-time applications.

This study introduces an open-source Vehicle Grid Integration (VGI) tool designed to simulate BEV driving and charging behaviors, specifically for the deployment of 58,900 BEVs in the Tokyo Metropolitan area by 2035. Unlike prior studies that focus solely on either Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) services or charging systems, this research simultaneously investigates both G2V and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) services, while optimizing public charging infrastructure. Three charging strategies (slow, medium, and fast) are analyzed, and an IF-THEN rule-based engine is implemented to ensure charging adequacy after V2G discharging operations. The tool uniquely incorporates inter-zonal driver movement across 14 zones—covering approximately 18 million households—whereas existing approaches only a single region. The results indicate that under V2G scenario, an additional 11.54 MW of generation capacity is needed to meet the annual BEV energy demand of 213.8 GWh, with peak demand occurring during daytime hours, highlighting the need for investments in renewable energy. The study also finds that under V2G scenario, the annual energy flow per BEV for G2V and potential V2G operations is 3630 kWh and 3528 kWh, respectively. Furthermore, the research specifies that under V2G scenario, for every 1000 BEVs, optimal charging infrastructure includes 2 fast chargers and 59 medium-speed chargers to ensure accessibility and alleviate range anxiety.

maybe,,"EV charging stations for sustainable urban transport electrification in the Arabian Peninsula: Performance assessment, social-economic aspects, opportunities, implementation challenges and strategic policies","The rapid adoption of electric vehicles, renewable energy sources, and advancements in battery technologies necessitate efficient, sustainable, and socio-economically viable interdependent energy systems. The rising penetration of EVs intensifies interdependencies between urban transport and electric power systems through charging infrastructures. This study presents a novel hybrid energy system that integrates renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic and wind turbines, conventional diesel generators, battery storage, and distribution grids to reliably satisfy the charging demands of electric vehicles in urban environments. A Hybrid Grey Wolf Cuckoo Search Algorithm (HGWCSA), which synergistically combines the exploitation capabilities of Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and the exploration strengths of Cuckoo Search (CS), is employed to optimize the system's sizing and operational performance of the charging system. The primary advantages of HGWCSA include faster convergence, superior solution accuracy, and robust capability to avoid local optima.

maybe,,"Optimal allocation and configuration of renewable energy sources, electric vehicle parking lots, and fixed and mobile batteries under uncertainty and demand response program","The global transition to renewable energy sources (RESs) is critical for mitigating environmental pollution and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. However, the inherent intermittency of RESs presents significant challenges to power system stability, which are further exacerbated by the anticipated rise in electric vehicles (EVs), projected to exceed 130 million by 2030. To support this transformation, a robust energy infrastructure that integrates RESs, smart plug-in EV parking lots (PEV-PLs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and demand response programs (DRPs) is essential. This paper proposes a stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the optimal planning and operation of distribution systems (PDS) with increasing RES and EV penetration. The model incorporates wind and photovoltaic (PV) distributed generators (DGs), PEV-PLs, fixed and mobile battery energy storage systems (FBESSs and MBESSs), and DRPs. It optimally determines the sizing and placement of key components while strategically managing the relocation of MBESSs to minimize economic costs (investment, maintenance, and operation), environmental impacts (carbon emissions from the PDS), power losses, and voltage deviations. The model also accounts for major uncertainties, including EV charging behavior, wind speed, solar irradiation, load demand, and energy price fluctuations. The proposed framework is validated using the IEEE 69-bus test system, with nine configurations evaluated, ranging from a baseline (Case 1) to a fully integrated setup (Case 9). These cases include various combinations of RESs, PEV-PLs, FBESSs, MBESSs, and DRPs. The analysis underscores the importance of coordinated integration of RESs, storage, and DRPs to achieve environmental and operational benefits. Among the evaluated configurations, Case 7, which includes RESs, PEV-PLs, MBESSs, and DRP, emerges as the most balanced solution, achieving the lowest emission cost ($323,516.65/year), the highest loss reduction (39.60%), and the greatest voltage deviation improvement (41.14%). Case 3 excels in reducing operational costs (35.66%) and achieving the highest RES penetration (2.65 MVA), demonstrating the benefits of combining wind-PV DGs with a moderate EV fleet. In contrast, Case 9, despite incorporating the highest EV penetration (179 EVs) and the most comprehensive mix of technologies, underperforms economically due to system complexity, with only a 16.54% reduction in operational costs and a 1.23% increase in total cost. Overall, the results indicate that configurations that balance RES integration with moderate EV deployment and strategic energy storage, such as Cases 3 and 7, offer the most effective trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.ecmx.2025.101041,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ecmx.2025.101041,18,high

maybe,,The potential of electrified transport for enhancing flexibility in integrated renewable energy systems,"This study investigates the role of battery electric vehicles in a future carbon-neutral European energy system, focusing on different vehicle charging strategies and their effects on the power system. Using an integrated planning model, the study analyzes the interaction between battery electric vehicle charging strategies and other flexibility options within the energy system. It compares three charging strategies – passive charging, flexible charging, and bi-directional Vehicle-to-Grid charging – which provide increasing levels of flexibility. The findings emphasize the cost-saving potential of flexible charging strategies. Flexible charging can reduce overall system costs by 7%, with the most significant savings and shifts seen in power generation. There is reduced investment in wind power, whereas investment in photovoltaic (solar) systems increases significantly compared to passive charging. Flexible charging improves solar energy's competitiveness over wind power by allowing peak solar generation to be absorbed as it occurs. There are also notable savings in fast-response options such as gas turbines, with 75% lower capacity investment in the scenario with the most flexible charging. In addition, investment in Power-to-X technologies, especially electrolyzers, is also lower due to more effective load shifting. Although flexible charging strategies may lead to challenging load peaks in the distribution grid, the study indicates that limiting the increase in load peaks to 60% can still result in a 6% reduction in overall system costs compared to passive charging.

maybe,,Driving change: Analyzing the interplay of electric vehicle adoption and grid electrification in New England,"The integration of electric vehicles into the power grid presents both opportunities and challenges for the transition to sustainable energy. This study examines the effects of unidirectional and bidirectional electric vehicle charging in New England using a least-cost optimization model. It finds that in a 100 % unidirectional charging electric vehicle adoption scenario, annual electricity demand could increase by 42 % (∼50 TW-hours), necessitating dynamic load management and adjustments in time-of-use pricing. While this added demand underscores the need for cost-effective renewable and storage solutions, “vehicle-to-grid” technology emerges as a key strategy to manage peak loads, reducing costs by 35 % compared to “unidirectional charging one-way vehicle” and easing reliance on grid batteries. Despite benefits like enhanced system flexibility and reduced capacity expansion needs, “vehicle-to-grid” poses challenges, including battery degradation, which can be mitigated by second-life battery use. Balancing unidirectional and bidirectional charging strategies is essential for optimizing grid performance, minimizing costs, and advancing a sustainable energy future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2024.134068,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2024.134068,18,high

However, this rise in EV numbers impacts distribution networks, affecting energy loss, bus voltage, grid stability, reliability, and harmonic distortion due to charging requirements. The increased peak demand on the grid from charging stations (CSs) poses a significant challenge. The location and capacity of CSs are influenced by investor decisions and EV user behavior. A multi-objective problem is formulated, considering the installation cost of charging infrastructure, energy loss in the electrical network, and EV users’ travel costs for charging. To mitigate grid demand, photovoltaic (PV) sources are proposed at distribution network nodes with CSs. Energy management strategies (EMSs) are implemented to efficiently control the discharging and charging of battery energy storage systems (BESS), aiming to minimize peak power demand and optimize PV source utilization. The proposed solution is tested on the IEEE-33 distribution network, with simulations running over 24 h. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique addresses uncertainties in PV generation and EV charging needs.

However, these non-dispatchable renewable technologies pose operational challenges for power systems, creating the need for increased storage solutions and effective demand-side management. In this context, leveraging the flexibility inherent in these emerging demand resources—such as electrolysers and EVs—is crucial for addressing the anticipated rise in electricity demand. This study evaluates the effects of flexible operation of electrolysers and smart charging of electric vehicles on renewable energy curtailment, backup capacity, energy storage systems, and dispatchable generation within the Portuguese power system, focusing on the 2030 horizon as outlined in the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP 2030).

However, the inherent uncertainties in RER generation and demand pose challenges for system operators, requiring flexible resources such as batteries and adaptive prosumers to enhance operational resilience. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive two-stage optimization model for integrating RERs within microgrids, leveraging the conditional value at risk (CVaR) technique to mitigate uncertainty-related risks. The first stage, implemented in MATLAB, optimizes the location and capacity of assets using an improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO).

Electric vehicles, as distributed and mobile energy storage devices, have the potential to enhance the resilience of distribution networks through vehicle to grid technology. In this study, resilience is integrated into the evaluation metrics for charging station layout planning, and a methodology for the layout of electric vehicle charging stations is proposed, balancing both economy and resilience. After constructing a typical extreme disaster scenario model using typhoons as an example, a resilience deployment model for charging stations is developed, which comprehensively considers the resilience of the distribution network and traffic flow. The objective function is designed to minimize the annual total social cost, which includes factors such as construction and operation costs, user usage costs, charging loss costs, and resilience configuration costs. A joint solution algorithm, combining the Voronoi diagram and particle swarm optimization algorithm, is proposed to solve the model. According to the simulation results of an illustrative example, the resilience optimization scenario performs well in terms of load loss penalty.

The role of BEV charging strategies in climate change mitigation should be evaluated considering the variety of power generation mixes since decarbonization pathways consistent with climate goals are diverse. This study assessed the robustness of BEV charging strategies using a detailed time-resolved power system model under diverse Japanese decarbonization pathways derived from a long-term energy system planning model. The results underscore the critical role of integrating BEVs and VRE, consistent across various decarbonization pathways, toward 2050.

To address these issues, this study proposes a real-time nested scheduling model with an adaptive charging–discharging strategy for community, supermarket, and street parking facilities. The model employs an adaptive approach where EV users provide essential information upon arrival at the microgrid (MG), choosing between unordered or ordered participation based on their preferences. A priority-based two-stage schedule planning strategy is implemented, first planning the overall charging–discharging power for the EV cluster, then refining individual EV power based on priorities. For EVs requiring early departure, priorities are adjusted to ensure the expected State of Charge is reached before leaving. The model features a real-time nested framework with a bi-level optimization outer layer to coordinate conflicting interests among entities and an inner layer for EV power allocation. To address high uncertainties, a Model Predictive Control algorithm is employed, incorporating Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, strong duality theorem, and linearization techniques.

To accommodate high-penetration PVs integration while maintaining economic efficiency and flexibility of ADN, a bi-level collaborative expansion planning model considering uncertainty generation and reduction is proposed in this paper. Based on described uncertainty scenarios of PV and load obtained by proposed Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and K-means method, the upper level firstly configures soft open points to adjust the ADN topology, then optimizes the siting and sizing of PVs, electric vehicle charging stations, energy storage systems, and active management resources (on-load tap changers, and static var compensators) with minimum investment cost. Lower level uses multi-objective mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model with network loss, PV curtailment and voltage deviation of different attributes to optimize ADN scheduling. To solve this planning model, a hybrid algorithm that integrates an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm with SOCP is proposed, employing the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) to address the multi-objective issue.

In the first layer, a bi-level feature selection model is developed to identify the region most affected by the hurricane. The model uses statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis, the Pearson correlation coefficient, neighborhood component analysis, and the Relief algorithm.

In this paper, the economic dispatch strategy of planning and operation is proposed to optimize the economy of DN. To better describe the correlation between EV charging demand and price uncertainty, a data-driven uncertainty set based on adjacent days is incorporated into two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model. The proposed uncertainty set abandons the extreme scenario and is closer to the real-world scenarios. In the planning stage, charging piles are upgraded to devices with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service capability, minimizing the planning cost. In the operational stage, the recourse method is adopted to quantify the worst output scenarios for wind, photovoltaic, and EV charging demands, which are reflected as the operating costs of the DN.

maybe,,Grid-aware charging infrastructure deployment: A hybrid monte Carlo and improved hummingbird algorithm for cost-efficiency and load balancing,"The large-scale grid connection of electric vehicles is increasingly putting pressure on the distribution network, and the problem of load imbalance poses serious challenges to the stability and operational efficiency of the power grid. The current research mainly focuses on single facility planning or simple optimization models, which are difficult to solve the complex interaction problems between spatiotemporal charging dynamics, user service demands, and grid constraints. To this end, this study proposes an innovative framework for collaborative planning of charging and swapping facilities. Firstly, Monte Carlo simulation of spatiotemporal load distribution is used to coordinate the allocation of charging and swapping facility resources, breaking through the limitations of traditional isolated planning. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed, using a weighted sum strategy to coordinate construction costs, user waiting time, and grid stability indicators, achieving dynamic balance of conflicting objectives. Furthermore, the Improved Hummingbird Algorithm (IAHA) is developed, which integrates chaotic mapping to enhance population diversity, and combines non-uniform mutation to achieve adaptive global local search, effectively solving high-dimensional complex programming problems. A case study in a certain region of northern China shows that compared to particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, this framework can reduce annual infrastructure costs by 62.3 million yuan, improve convergence speed by 40%, and significantly improve the load balancing characteristics of the power grid.

To enhance the electric vehicle charging capacity of community power grids, this paper proposes a two-tier capacity allocation strategy for community microgrids in the context of power systems. The upper-level model allocates capacity with the objectives of highest MG reliability, minimum comprehensive operating cost and minimum carbon emission, while the lower-level model optimizes the scheduling strategy with the objectives of minimum weighted operating cost and minimum charging cost for EV users. First, the real-time price is used to guide the residents’ electricity consumption behavior to be more adaptive to the uncertainty of renewable energy sources and to ensure that the community MG has sufficient resilient capacity. Second, based on the alternative storage effect of EVs, EVs are integrated with storage batteries and participate in ancillary services. The results indicate that adopting the charging and discharging strategy can reduce the comprehensive operating cost by ¥3,673.575 while improving reliability by 1.925%. Although the carbon trading market increases the overall operating cost, it results in an additional 131.5 kW of renewable energy capacity. Furthermore, the microgrid's participation in the ancillary service market can reduce costs by ¥7,992.9.

The increasing integration of renewable resources, such as solar and wind power, along with the rising adoption of EVs, underscores the need for robust strategies to optimize their incorporation into power systems. This study proposes a strategic, long-term planning optimization framework for the effective integration of green energy technologies. The framework emphasizes the optimal deployment of wind and photovoltaic (PV) distributed generators (DGs) for RESs and the establishment of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging infrastructure within distribution systems (DS). Furthermore, stationary battery energy storage systems (SBESSs) are integrated to enhance the penetration of RESs and EVs. The proposed framework determines optimal locations, sizes, and operational strategies for RESs, PEV infrastructure, and SBESSs while addressing technical, operational, and economic constraints. It accounts for uncertainties such as renewable generation variability, energy prices, electricity demand, and EV energy and time dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) and the backward reduction method (BRM) are employed to analyse various scenarios and ensure computational efficiency. Additionally, a coordinated charging and discharging control mechanism for SBESSs and EVs is developed to manage active and reactive power, thereby improving overall system performance. The framework simultaneously minimizes three objectives: long-term planning and operation cost, total power loss, and voltage deviation. Advanced optimization algorithms, including the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), are utilized to achieve these goals. The methodology is validated on a 69-bus system under four distinct configurations. Results indicate that the integration of wind, PV, PEV infrastructure, and SBESSs significantly enhances green energy penetration and system efficiency compared to other configurations. For instance, the integration of RESs and PEVs increases RES penetration from 3.35 MVA to 3.80 MVA with an optimal EV fleet size of 249 vehicles, achieving a 2.14 % reduction in total cost, albeit with a 6.33 % increase in power loss and a 2.03 % rise in voltage deviation compared to the RES-only scenario. The addition of SBESSs further improves RES penetration to 3.90 MVA, reduces costs by an additional 0.88 %, and mitigates power loss and voltage deviation by 13.36 % and 9.80 %, respectively, though it reduces the EV fleet size from 249 to 168 vehicles.

Energy Storage Systems (ESS) play a critical role in mitigating fluctuations in RES output. This study evaluates the technical and economic effects of integrating RESs and ESSs into the power system under different scenarios. The first case examines the base system without RES/ESS (base case). The second case incorporates optimal capacitor placement. In the third case, RES units are introduced, followed by the integration of Electric Vehicle (EV) parking lots with optimal capacity determination in the fourth scenario. Three sub-scenarios assess the role of EV batteries, considering financial efficiency, RES output fluctuation smoothing, and load profile optimization. The findings highlight the positive impact of batteries across all cases. In the first scenario, EV batteries provide significant cost benefits for owners. In the second, they assist in managing RES penetration while mitigating adverse effects. The third scenario demonstrates improvements in power quality and grid stability, ensuring reliable power during peak demand and reducing dependence on the upstream network. Key contributions include the optimal placement and planning of capacitors, RES units, and EV parking lots in distribution systems, which reduce power loss costs and improve voltage profiles.

The cost of active power purchased from the upstream network decreases by approximately 24 % in the third case, with reductions of 0 % and 20 % in the second and third cases, respectively.

Key concerns include voltage deviations and increased active power losses due to the high penetration of EVCSs. This study proposes a comprehensive multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework for the optimal integration of EVCSs and shunt capacitors (SCs) within the DN, while simultaneously considering the dynamics of the transportation network (TN). To ensure an efficient and sustainable charging infrastructure, a Driving Range-based Traffic Flow Capturing (TFC) model is employed to optimize EV traffic flow coverage, accounting for EV battery constraints and strategic station placement. The proposed framework aims to minimize active power loss (APL) and voltage deviation (VD) in the DN while maximizing EV flow in the TN. To solve this complex multi-objective problem, a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (HGCO) is developed by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO). Objective function normalization is applied to balance the conflicting goals between the DN and TN. The proposed framework was tested on a 33-bus DN and a 25-node TN under three different planning approaches: one focusing on the DN, another on the TN, and a third on their integrated operation. In the integrated planning case, the system recorded an APL of 161.3842 kW and captured 39.45% of electric vehicle flow when battery constraints were applied. Upon removing these constraints, performance improved significantly, with the APL decreasing to 148.5903 kW and EV flow capture rising to 50.52%. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HGCO algorithm effectively balances power system reliability and transportation service efficiency. This integrated planning approach highlights the importance of coordinated EVCS and SC placement in realizing a resilient, efficient, and sustainable electric mobility infrastructure. © 2025",10.1016/j.est.2025.118585,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2025.118585,18,high

The paper presents the innovative use of a recompression supercritical CO₂ (S-CO₂) Brayton cycle with an ejector as a storage system to absorb the fluctuations of renewables and to extend system flexibility. The given optimization framework is capable of figuring out the best location and the right capacity of the microgrids, and, besides, it can perform a 24-h dynamic scheduling of electric vehicle charging rates. The electric vehicle uncertainties, including fleet size, travel distance, and stochastic charging behavior, are explicitly incorporated. Simulations of the IEEE-30 bus system validate the considerable technical and economic advantages. The optimal microgrid deployment leads to a reduction of active power losses of 0.467 MW (3.9 % reduction), and the voltage profiles are also improved, with all buses being within the ±5 % operational range. Coordinating electric vehicle scheduling, through cutting the consumption of electricity from the grid, achieves a reduction of daily operating costs of roughly 13 % which is a significant saving. Moreover, the S-CO₂ storage system allows for a quick response to sudden changes in demand and supply of electricity. Besides that, the decrease in energy losses is consistent with the non-production of ≈3000 tons of CO₂ emissions per year; thus, the proposal can be considered as a sustainable one.

However, existing studies primarily focus on individual network simulations, which are computationally intensive and lack scalability. Moreover, most research relies on synthetic network models rather than real-world distribution system operator (DSO) data, limiting practical applicability. This study addresses these gaps by developing a Reference Network Model (RNM) tailored to the Slovenian LV distribution system. The first objective is to establish reference radial network models based on real DSO data, enabling simulation generalization across the entire distribution network. Using k-medoids clustering, LV networks are categorized into representative groups, facilitating efficient analysis without exhaustive individual network simulations. The second objective is to develop a generalization methodology that extrapolates simulation results from reference networks to the entire LV distribution system. Unlike conventional RNM applications, this approach integrates real-world Slovenian DSO data and incorporates scenario-based reinforcement planning to address the evolving impact of DERs, EVs, and HPs. A key result is cost-benefit analysis, which evaluates investment requirements and operational savings, offering insights for policymakers and DSOs to optimize network planning.

In addition, the disorderly charging of EVs will also lead to uneven benefits of charging stations (CSs) operators and high power loss in the distribution network. To solve these problems, we construct a capacity planning model for CSs with the objective of minimizing the total cost of EVs, CS operators and power grid. By solving this model, the capacity planning result of CSs could meet all given constraints even under a disorderly charging strategy. However, disorderly charging will lead to the unbalanced use of CSs, which may further cause the waste of charging resources. Therefore, we propose the fast charging strategy considering the utilization equilibrium of the CSs and slow charging strategy considering the total charging cost of EVs. By collecting travel plans and vehicle status information of EVs in advance, the intelligent transportation system (ITS) will centrally arranges the charging schedule for EVs and sets the time-sharing charging price for all CSs. Finally, compared with the disorderly charging strategy, we verify that the proposed fast charging strategies could improve the total income of CS operators, reduce power loss and balance the average queuing time of each CS and slow charging strategies could flexibly adjust the EVs charging cost and CSs charging income through IEEE 33-bus and road net 63-node coupling system. © 2025",10.1016/j.ijepes.2025.110960,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2025.110960,18,high

Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, using 2024 data from the Jibei region of northern China and two extreme blizzard scenarios, demonstrate that combining resilience-oriented planning with V2G coordination significantly reduces total system costs by 58.02% compared to the baseline, achieving the lowest total cost of $2.48×103 million.

Several parameters are taken into account as part of this process, such as proximity to load centers, capacity of the power system, and traffic volume. The common charging station location distant from the load centers has been established to enhance the quality of power and reduce 5–10 % of distribution losses. Additionally, site location should also include the area land cost and this cost in the urban area is estimated to be about $500 to $2000 per square meter and other zoning regulations. In the design, the service radius of charging stations is also an important factor; Keeping the battery's DOD between 50 % and 70 % yields an estimated driving range of 150–200 km, which suggests a distance between stations of 50–70 km. In this case, the discount rate of 5 % can be adopted for O&M costs over the planning horizon of 20 years while the capital costs of provision of each station varies from $ 50,000 to $ 200,000 depending on the size of the station. The establishment of a large network for charging the EVs will enhance the power balance of the system thus reducing power losses whilst increasing the penetration of electric vehicles by integrating these numerical aspects together with technology and environmental considerations. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.prime.2025.100965,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.prime.2025.100965,18,high

In the first stage, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is adopted to plan the siting and sizing of each device in the integrated energy distribution network. In the second stage, based on the siting and sizing results, an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to schedule the daily energy storage dispatch and reactive power output. Through this two-stage optimization, the issues of unbalanced load distribution and voltage quality in the distribution network are resolved, while minimizing investment costs. The IEEE 69-node simulation results demonstrate that under the optimal scenario, the average voltage deviation of the distribution system remains stable at 1.0 p.u., the line loss rate decreases to 2.90 %, and the initial construction cost and operational cost reach 120,220,000 CNY and 16,923.88 CNY, respectively. Compared with similar algorithms, the proposed hybrid algorithm achieves a 34.5% improvement in loss reduction, significantly enhances voltage stability, and reduces daily operational costs by 9.91 %, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ref.2025.100716,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ref.2025.100716,18,high
maybe,,Comprehensive methodology for assessing the impact of vehicle-to-grid integration in power system expansion planning,"The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) emphasizes the critical need to assess their integration into the electricity grid for a sustainable energy transition. Existing literature lacks comprehensive vehicle-to-grid (V2G) impact analyses and methodologies for long-term integration, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, the absence of optimized short-term operational models for EV integration poses challenges in grid management. To bridge these gaps, this research proposes a socio-economic model to estimate EV sales based on the Bass diffusion model and macroeconomic regressions. Additionally, it integrates electricity system expansion planning using the OSeMOSYS tool with a short-term operational model based on unit commitment. In this context, this work endeavors to develop a methodology for estimating the impact of V2G technology, considering both the deployment and utilization of EVs in a Brazilian case study. Applying traditional methodologies that do not consider operational system models can lead to potential future load shedding. It may accentuate disparities between long-term and short-term outcomes, especially with EV and V2G integration. The proposed methodology corrected the overestimation of the energy injection potential of EVs by the traditional model, indicating the need to consider both the expansion and the operation of the electricity system when planning the integration of EVs. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ref.2025.100718,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ref.2025.100718,18,high
maybe,,Optimizing load response programs in generation expansion planning: A real-time pricing scenario with responsive load aggregators,"Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) is a strategic procedure implemented to find the optimal mix and capacity of energy resources, balancing reliability, cost, and environmental effect to supply future electricity demand. It is specifically challenging with the increased integration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar, due to the uncertainty behavior in power systems. In this paper, with the aim of reducing cost, increasing welfare of consumer and increasing revenue of Load Serving Entities (LSEs), a GEP structure is introduced which is described these challenges using a fuzzy wavelet-based approach. This structure contains an advanced Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network (FWNN) to model uncertainties in renewable production, permitting for more accurate and adaptive decision-making below variable situations. Additionally, a real-time pricing mechanism managed by LSEs is implemented, which regulates prices for flexible electric loads considering current demand, encouraging consumers to shift their energy demand response to price changes. This method not only supports grid stability but also supplies economic motivations for consumers with providing flexible loads area, while inflexible electric and heat loads continue to function at retail market taxes. To analyze the efficiency of our model, two scenarios is considered as follow: in the first, consumers contribute in the demand response program, leading to higher LSE revenue (by 26 %) and lower consumer payments (by 10 %) compared to the second scenario, where consumers do not contribute and all loads follow retail market pricing. The welfare in the first scenario is slightly reduced by 5.9 %, reflecting the trade-off between cost savings and flexible load alterations. These results, subsequent through a GAMS-based optimization, prove the proposed framework's ability to improve grid resilience, decrease costs, and expand renewable integration, offering economic and operational profits for both LSEs and consumers. © 2024",10.1016/j.renene.2024.122051,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2024.122051,18,high

The region assumes a significantly prominent status and fulfills a crucial role in China's energy security and power transition. This study concentrates on the low-carbon transition of the power system in West Inner Mongolia and examines pathways to accomplish the “carbon peak and neutrality” objectives. It emphasizes the significance of escalating electrification rates and the interplay between supply and demand in shaping future power systems. According to the future development direction of West Inner Mongolia and the load responsiveness characteristics, demand response (DR), Electric vehicles (EVs), and electric hydrogen production (EHP) are integrated into a planning model aimed at optimizing costs while ensuring operational safety. An analysis of the institutional framework and development trajectories for 2030 and 2060 is conducted, underscoring the pivotal role of demand-side flexibilities in the power system's transition. The research indicates that constructing a predominantly clean power supply system is essential for realizing the “carbon peak and neutrality” objectives, with energy storages and demand-side flexibilities playing crucial roles in regulating power surpluses and providing auxiliary services. Notably, EHP's extended energy storage capabilities effectively address seasonal imbalances in renewable energy output. The quantitative analysis indicates that the energy storage investment can be substantially reduced due to rapid advancements in DR and EHP, with a 5.3 % reduction when DR increases by 25 % and an 11.2 % reduction when EHP increases by 30 %. Consequently, strategically deploying demand-side flexibilities emerges as a promising strategy for enhancing the economic efficiency of the power system's low-carbon transition. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.renene.2025.122478,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2025.122478,18,high
maybe,,Planning and economic analysis of low-carbon transition of East China power system considering electricity-hydrogen coupling,"The transition of current electric power systems to low-carbon emissions is a critical task in power system planning. Due to the strong coupling between hydrogen and electric energy systems, considering the role of hydrogen in power system planning can increase the penetration rate of renewable energy and help the low-carbon transition. This paper uses planning and economic analysis to determine the path to a low-carbon transition in East China. First, an electricity-hydrogen coupling generation and transmission expansion planning model is constructed with the total system planning cost as the objective function. Then, a low-dimensional matrix modeling method that considers energy conversion equipment, energy storage equipment, demand response and energy networks is proposed. Finally, the planning results of various scenarios and the low-carbon transition path under the optimal scenario are analyzed, and the impacts of the cost of hydrogen production through water electrolysis and the charging mode of electric vehicles are also investigated. The case study results show that the proposed low-dimensional matrix modeling method can effectively solve the long-term planning problem for large-scale systems, and changes in the expected carbon neutral time will affect the speed and scale of the expansion of power generation and transmission capacity at each stage. The case study also indicates that electricity-hydrogen coupling reduces carbon emissions and total planning costs by 18.8 % and 10.7 %, respectively and reduce 38 % imported energy from other regions for East China. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.renene.2025.123244,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2025.123244,18,high
maybe,,Optimal planning and operation of energy community DERs considering local energy trading and uncertainties,"Local energy trading between customers in energy communities (ECs) received significant interest from academia and industry as a promising approach for managing a large number of distributed energy resources (DERs) and empowering end users to take an active role in energy systems. Most of the existing literature focuses on the operation of ECs, often with an implicit assumption about the capacities (i.e., ratings) and penetration levels of the DERs. However, there is a noticeable lack of emphasis on optimizing the planning and integration of DERs within these ECs. Considering the high cost of DERs, there is a need to optimally size DERs of ECs' participants that maximize the benefits, minimize the expenses of DER owners, and reduce the payback period. In this paper, a linear programming model is proposed for the optimal planning and operation of DERs installed in a residential EC in Spain, which includes photovoltaic (PV), battery energy storage (BES), and electric vehicles (EV). The objective is to minimize the EC's total annual costs, including investment, maintenance and operation (O&M), and operation costs (i.e., energy and contracted power costs). Furthermore, the proposed approach considers load demand, PV generation, electricity prices, and EVs arrival and departure uncertainties. The simulation results demonstrate that optimal planning reduces the annual costs by 10.95 % compared to the scenario without optimal PV and BES planning. Sensitivity analysis shows that, by decreasing the investment costs of BES by 30 %, increasing the electricity prices by 40 %, or decreasing the electricity selling price by 40 %, it could be feasible to install BES at part of the EC houses. There are no violations of the distribution network limits in all studied scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study proposes a smart and integrated framework designed to enhance system resilience by leveraging coordinated multi-energy microgrids (MGs) and distributed energy resources (DERs). The proposed framework introduces four key components: (1) a spatiotemporal resilience assessment approach incorporating robustness, survivability, and recoverability indices; (2) a hierarchical control architecture for MG coordination; (3) a hybrid stochastic–robust optimization model to balance operational efficiency and resilience objectives; and (4) data-driven, self-learning decision-making mechanisms enabled by real-time analytics. The framework is implemented on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system with integrated electrical, thermal, and gas subsystems. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a 60% reduction in outage duration, 95% retention of critical loads during contingencies, and a 52.5% reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions per event. Notable innovations include the integration of bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) support, dynamic DER dispatch, and multi-domain resilience metrics. Despite resilience gains, trade-offs were observed—most notably, an active power loss of 8613.89 kW associated with a resilience index of –35.61—underscoring the need for adaptive weight tuning in multi-objective optimization. Overall, this work bridges theoretical concepts of resilience with practical implementation strategies, offering actionable insights for utility operators in both planning and real-time response contexts. © 2025",10.1016/j.rineng.2025.105635,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.rineng.2025.105635,18,high
maybe,,Optimization of distribution networks using quantum annealing for loss reduction and voltage improvement in electrical vehicle parking management,"This paper explores the integration of Electric Vehicle (EV) parking lots into power distribution networks (DNs) and proposes a quantum-based optimization framework to enhance grid performance. As EV and renewable energy source (RES) penetration increases, coordinated EV charging and discharging becomes critical for reducing power losses, improving voltage profiles, and supporting energy storage management. Traditional optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) often struggle with the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of EV-grid interaction problems. In contrast, Quantum Annealing (QA) leverages quantum tunneling and parallelism to efficiently explore complex solution spaces. The proposed approach formulates the EV parking scheduling task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, suitable for quantum processing. Simulation studies on IEEE 13-, 33-, and 69-bus systems show that QA significantly outperforms GA and PSO. Notably, in the 13-bus network, QA reduced power losses by 72.07 % and voltage deviation by 87.5 %; corresponding reductions in 33- and 69-bus systems were 42.1 % and 46.6 %, respectively. The results demonstrate the method's scalability and effectiveness in handling real-time EV integration while reducing operational costs and supporting voltage stability. From a societal perspective, the framework facilitates cleaner energy usage and more intelligent urban EV infrastructure planning. However, limitations include the reliance on quantum simulators (rather than physical hardware) and the assumption of deterministic EV behavior. Future research will investigate hybrid quantum-classical implementations and stochastic modeling using real-world data.

This paper introduces a robust and uncertainty-conscious optimization framework for the strategic integration of BEV charging infrastructure into unbalanced distribution systems. The proposed approach incorporates key sources of uncertainty, such as variability in base electrical loads, intermittent outputs from renewable energy sources (RESs), and stochastic patterns of BEV charging behavior, using Hong's Three-Point Estimate Method (H3PEM). Also, a novel Advanced Multi-objective Growth Optimizer (AMOGO) is developed to achieve a balanced optimization across technical and planning objectives, including the minimization of total active losses, the improvement of the Total Voltage Stability Index (TVSI), and the maximization of the network's BEV hosting capacity. The proposed strategy is validated on the widely recognized IEEE 123-bus unbalanced system under multiple operational scenarios, each differing in the number and capacity of installed charging stations. Benchmark comparisons with established metaheuristic algorithms of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the original GO, and the Enzyme Action Optimizer (EAO) highlight AMOGO's superior performance. Results show that AMOGO not only exhibits faster and more stable convergence but also achieves significant enhancements in system efficiency and resilience, with a 72.7 % reduction in power losses and a 10.51 % improvement in voltage stability.

The proposed station comprises facilities for hydrogen fueling and electric vehicle charging stations, structured as a bi-level optimization approach. The upper-level model focuses on the planning phase of the refueling station. Its objective is to minimize annual costs associated with construction, maintenance, and operation. Key constraints involve operational planning for renewable sources, battery systems, and vehicle refueling stations while accounting for reactive power management. In contrast, the lower-level formulation deals with the eco-scheduling of smart distribution grid. Its goal is to minimize the sum of annual energy losses and operation costs within the grid, governed by linearized optimal power flow model. To account for uncertainties in demand, energy prices, renewable generation output, and refueling station performance, a stochastic optimization framework is employed. The solution is derived using Benders decomposition algorithm to achieve optimal results. The primary innovation highlighted in this paper includes integrating renewable resources and battery systems to power the refueling station, leveraging reactive power control for improved station performance, and addressing both operational and economic objectives in the distribution system. Numerical results underscore the advantages of this strategy. Constructing a refueling station without battery and renewable units leads to significant drawbacks, an increase in network operation cost by 144.6 % and grid energy loss by 167.6 %. Voltage levels drop below 0.9 per-unit, and distribution lines experience severe loading of up to 34.7 %.

The large-scale deployment of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) introduces operational issues such as elevated power losses, voltage instability, and line overloading, thereby testing the grid's robustness and efficiency. To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel optimization framework that integrates the quasi-refined slime mould algorithm (QRSMA) with conventional slime mould algorithm (SMA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques for the optimal placement of solar-based distributed generators (SDGs) and shunt capacitors (SCs). The proposed method aims to minimize a multi-objective function incorporating real and reactive power losses, voltage deviation, and voltage stability, thereby enhancing the stability and reliability of RDN operations. The framework employs stochastic modeling based on four years of hourly meteorological data to account for uncertainties in solar irradiance and temperature. Additionally, the EVCS model includes dynamic operational aspects such as mean queue lengths, waiting times, and demand response (DR) load control. The methodology is validated using both a practical Indian 28-bus RDN and the large-scale IEEE 118-bus system to assess scalability and generalizability. Simulation results confirm the superior performance of QRSMA in improving voltage profiles, reducing power losses, and achieving better computational efficiency compared to conventional optimization algorithms. Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the robustness of QRSMA under varying objective priorities. Moreover, the economic assessment using the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) indicates strong financial viability for real-world implementation.

These include additional power losses, excess yield gaps, drops in voltage levels, and reduced operational flexibility. This work propose a complete optimization model that consists of several steps to enhance the performance and resilience of radial distribution systems (RDS) with respect to daily and seasonal variations using the Transit Search Optimization (TSO) algorithm. Such strategies include optimal allocation of RES, placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS), dynamic network reconfiguration, and improved unit commitment strategies to enhance power quality, mitigate losses, and maintain stable voltage levels. A multi-objective function opts to achieve optimal RES hosting capacity together with optimal tie-switch settings across scenario-based summer, winter, spring, and fall shifts. Simulations were done on both a modified IEEE 33-bus system and a practical 51-bus distribution network. A multi-function framework on TSO is employed for optimal dynamic reconfiguration strategy to improve the performance of the distribution network considering the dynamic behavior of power profiles of wind speed and solar irradiation over a 24-hour period with varying seasons.

maybe,,Simulation and performance evaluation of optimal electric vehicle charging stations placement under diverse electrical load demand and renewable energy sources generation scenarios in a low-voltage distribution network,"The rapid integration of Distributed Renewable Energy Sources and Electric Vehicles (EVs) is transforming modern Distribution Networks (DNs), introducing technical challenges such as voltage deviation, reverse power flows, and line congestion. However, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) also present an opportunity to absorb local renewable generation and support voltage regulation. This paper proposes an iterative optimisation algorithm based on a full non-linear AC power flow model to determine the optimal EVCS placement within a real low-voltage DN in the UK. Simulations were conducted under various load and generation profiles using real charging data for 22 kW public EVCSs. Results show that with optimal placement, up to 15 EVCSs can be integrated without violating grid constraints. The best placement strategy, which minimises energy absorbed from the MV/LV transformer, reduced voltage standard deviation by over 54 % and eliminated reverse power flows. Additionally, the presence of EVCSs enabled a 193.88 % increase in Photovoltaic (PV) generation compared to the reference scenario, while maintaining voltage within operational limits. In scenarios with high load and limited generation, EVCS integration was constrained due to line loading limits. Conversely, in high-generation scenarios, EVCSs successfully reduced RPFs by over 90 % and allowed more local energy consumption. Further simulations demonstrated that even with energy absorption constraints, strategic placement of just 5 EVCSs was sufficient to eliminate RPFs. The study confirms that properly located EVCSs are essential for enhancing grid flexibility and PV self-consumption, enabling higher DRES penetration, and improving overall DN performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of EVCS siting that simultaneously eliminates reverse power flows and enhances PV integration in a real DN case study. © 2025 The Authors.",10.1016/j.rineng.2025.108217,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.rineng.2025.108217,18,high

This study introduces a novel Coordinated Expansion Planning (CEP) model for efficiently deploying Electric Bike Urban Charging Stations (EB-UCSs) integrated with renewable energy sources, reactive power support devices, and grid reinforcement strategies. The proposed model utilizes a robust hybrid methodology combining Probability & Statistics (PS), Stochastic Programming (SP), and Chance-Constrained Programming (CCP) to effectively address uncertainties in EB demand behavior, conventional load demand, Distributed Generation (DG) power output, and Substation Capacity Optimization (SCO). By applying the model to both 54-bus and 123-bus test systems, the study evaluates the operational and economic performance of PDNs under deterministic and non-deterministic scenarios. Results reveal that integrating EB-UCSs within the PDN significantly reduces grid reinforcement costs and enhances system reliability and sustainability. In the 54-bus system, the CEP framework achieves cost reductions of 3.51 %, 5.21 %, and 4.69 % in deterministic (Case I and II) and non-deterministic conditions (Case IV) compared to the most challenging scenario (Case III). Similarly, in the 123-bus system, cost savings of 3.39 %, 9.71 %, and 4.17 % are observed for the same cases. Strategic placement of EB-UCSs near wind turbines (WTs) and capacitor banks (CBs) minimizes transmission losses and optimizes renewable energy utilization. Including these infrastructures also ensures voltage stability and reduces substation overloading, thereby fostering resilient and sustainable urban energy systems. Furthermore, the proposed classical mathematical approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of cost efficiency and computational time compared to metaheuristic algorithms, such as the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO). For instance, in the 123-bus system under Case IV, the classical approach achieves a computational time of 2.9 h, significantly lower than the 5.8–7.2 h required by metaheuristic methods. This highlights the scalability and practical feasibility of the proposed model for large-scale applications.

maybe,,Electric vehicles’ potential for smoothing daily load profile considering mobility needs and solar output,"The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and the growing adoption of renewable energy sources pose challenges to electricity grids, including unbalanced spatiotemporal power supply and demand, insufficient transmission and distribution capacities, and high power generation ramping needs. This study aims to better understand the potential of leveraging EVs’ charging flexibility as energy storage to smooth daily power load profiles considering different solar and EV penetration levels. To achieve this goal, we propose a mathematical formulation of the charging flexibility set based on real daily trip-chain data and develop a convex optimization model to optimize the smoothness of the regional net load profile subject to the charging flexibility set. We implement the model using mobility, solar generation, and power load data in the service region of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP). Through sensitivity analyses, we quantify the potential impacts of EVs on the power systems at different levels of EV penetration, charging infrastructure availability, power load, and solar generation. The results demonstrate that EVs have the potential to smooth the overall power load if their charging/discharging scheduling can be properly coordinated. In particular, EVs can reduce the maximum ramping caused by uncoordinated charging by 65 % through the use of managed charging/discharging capabilities. Additionally, providing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities at the existing public charging stations can lead to a 29 % ramp decrease compared with only allowing V2G at home. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2025.101761,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2025.101761,18,high
maybe,,Data strategy for active distribution networks: a framework to quantify data granularity impact on cyber-physical planning and operation,"The operational challenges of the integration of electric vehicles (EV), air conditioning and photovoltaic panels (PV) are prompting the upgrade of distribution grids, seen here as cyber-physical infrastructures. An important upgrading feature of the cyber-side is the electrical grid monitoring, which needs to expand both in data coverage and granularity. The challenge is to decide the data strategy, or in other words, which level of granularity is actually needed in active distribution networks. This work proposes a framework to assist grid planners in selecting the level of data expansion needed, by quantifying the impact of extended data granularity on control capabilities, and corresponding grid performance. The framework combines machine learning with AC optimal power flow and state estimation to select incremental upgrades of the cyber-physical infrastructure. Grid planning and operation are simulated and tested for the IEEE 33-bus test system over a 5-year span to assess the role of granularity in grid performance for different cyber-infrastructures. The results show that extending data granularity is critical for mitigating voltage violations under high penetration of EVs, air conditioning and PVs. By modeling the relationships between data, grid planning and operation, and grid performance, the framework supports efficient cyber system upgrades to mitigate operational violations while accounting for budget limitations. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.segan.2025.101763,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2025.101763,18,high
maybe,,Techno-economic comparison of grid reinforcement and battery-buffered electric vehicle fast charging stations,"Connecting fast charging stations to the electric grid usually requires an upgrade with new transformer stations and cables to accommodate the higher loading. Battery-based solutions can be operated following different control objectives and support the grid to reduce the investment need in conventional assets. A grid planning algorithm is developed to perform this comparison. The impact of the rollout of distributed energy resources on a Danish urban grid is assessed, based on a forecasted scenario and the geographical distribution of new loads and generators until 2045. Fast charging stations are added to this rollout, and the resulting grid issues are mitigated using a conventional grid reinforcement method. In a second iteration, batteries are installed in combination with fast charging stations to support them. The remaining capacity is used to solve the previously mentioned grid issues, using controllers that achieve good performance. The technical and economic impact of the conventional grid reinforcement and the battery-based one are compared in a cost–benefit analysis. Depending on cost sensitivities, the battery-based alternative can range from being 40 % cheaper to over 1400 % more expensive than a conventional grid extension—despite potential investment deferrals, which are often outweighed by higher capital costs and energy losses. Across all battery connection topologies and price sensitivities, the conventional grid upgrade solution remains the most cost-efficient one in 89 % of all investigated cases, with the battery-buffered one being only competitive in edge cases. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.segan.2025.101789,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2025.101789,18,high
maybe,,Optimal allocation and sizing of electric vehicle charging infrastructure for green last-mile logistics,"The transition towards electric mobility is being promoted by the European Union as a countermeasure to the greenhouse gas emissions in road transportation. Consequently, the adoption of electric vehicle fleets for freight movement and last-mile deliveries is in progress: this transition is viable if sufficient electric charging infrastructures are available within their operating routes. However, allocation of chargers at city centres may pose problems related to congestions in the power distribution network during peak hours, along with possible peaks in renewable energy sources production. This paper presents a mathematical programming formulation for the optimal allocation and sizing of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure within an urban area in which a fleet of electric vehicles for freight delivery operates. The considered urban area is divided into peripheral and internal zones, with the former able to host depots and large electric vehicle charging hubs and the latter hosting smaller electric vehicle charging areas. The optimization problem, formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, aims to allocate and size the photovoltaic units, the battery energy storage systems and the electric vehicle chargers to be installed in each zone, depending on local requirements, while allowing the electric vehicle fleet to satisfy the predefined logistic demand in the considered zones. The model is applied to a delivery fleet operating in the city of Milan, Italy, considering various scenarios and making some sensitivity analyses for evaluating the impact of economic parameters on the optimal configuration of the facility. The results show that photovoltaic units are a viable solution towards sustainable logistics, while the installation of battery energy storage systems is not always favorable. Quick alternating current chargers and vehicle-to-grid chargers are generally preferable, while fast direct current chargers are economically viable only under certain conditions. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.segan.2025.101898,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2025.101898,18,high
maybe,,A novel planning and operation strategy of solar rooftop EV parking lots in a coupled transportation-distribution network considering uncertainties,"Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a sustainable path for decarbonizing transportation, and solar rooftop parking lots (SRPLs) enable their integration with solar energy. The growing adoption of EVs poses challenges for power grid integration, including peak demand spikes, voltage instability, network congestion, and uncertain charging behaviour. Addressing these issues requires coordinated planning and operation that meet both transportation and distribution network goals. A multi-stage approach effectively handles multiple objectives. This study introduces strategic two-stage planning and operation of SRPLs in a coupled transportation (TN)-distribution network (DN). In the first stage, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the ideal locations and sizes of SRPLs by integrating a novel EV user satisfaction cost index. The objectives in this stage focus on enhancing the operational performance of both the transportation and distribution networks. In the second stage, the identified locations and sizes are used to determine the optimal operation of SRPLs, taking into account seasonal variations in solar generation and load demand. The objectives aim to maximize SRPL operator profit while minimizing EV user payments, additional DN operator costs, and grid emissions. Fuzzy max-min composition is used to determine the optimal solution by simultaneously satisfying all objectives to the highest possible extent. The proposed technique, validated on real (28-node TN, 69-bus DN) and test (35-node TN, 85-bus DN) systems, effectively identifies SRPL locations, ratings, and operation strategies. Vehicle-to-grid mode of EVs at SRPLs increases profit by 26.19 %, reduces EV user costs by 6.55 %, and cuts grid emissions by 4.86 %. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2025.101988,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2025.101988,18,high
maybe,,Electric vehicle charging infrastructure planning with integrated energy management and parking behavior analysis,"The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) offers ecological and economic benefits but also introduces challenges to power distribution networks, including increased energy losses, voltage fluctuations, reduced reliability, and higher peak demand. Uncoordinated deployment of charging stations (EVCSs) may further deteriorate grid performance. While existing studies have examined EVCS siting or renewable energy integration separately, few provide a holistic framework that simultaneously considers EVCS planning, renewable generation, storage-based energy management, and user behavior under uncertainty. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated planning model that determines the optimal locations and sizes of EVCSs, aiming to minimize energy losses, investment costs, and driver travel costs, while reducing peak demand and maximizing renewable energy utilization. To achieve this, a hybrid Gray Wolf Optimization–Particle Swarm Optimization (GWO–PSO) algorithm is applied for multi-objective optimization, chosen for its effective balance of global exploration and local exploitation. Photovoltaic (PV) systems are incorporated at selected distribution nodes, and energy management strategies (EMSs) are designed to coordinate energy storage system (ESS) operations. Uncertainties in PV generation and EV charging demand are addressed using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The methodology is validated on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system under a 24-hour simulation. Results show that integrating EMS with optimally located EVCSs reduces average energy losses by up to 15 % and lowers peak power demand by 20 %.

maybe,,Probabilistic flexibility assessment of shared charging stations for electric vehicles,"This paper proposes a probabilistic model for the flexibility assessment of shared charging stations for electric vehicles. Flexibility is modelled and evaluated in terms of the potential to reduce demand during the specified flexibility service window. Model is developed within the probabilistic framework to ensure that the randomness in modelled quantities is addressed. Main factors, which affect demand and available flexibility of charging stations, are identified and modelled in terms of the usage patterns of shared chargers, EV charging characteristics and customers’ charging preferences. Based on the proposed links between input, internal and output quantities, probability distributions of SoC value while charging, temporary charging duration at specified time, as well as the maximum aggregate charging power are calculated and presented. Finally, limits of available flexibility [kW] are quantified from the developed model for distinctive combinations of charging power rating, chargers’ location and flexibility service window.

maybe,,Dynamic equilibrium of the coupled transportation and power networks considering electric vehicles charging behavior,"The coupling between the transportation network (TN) and power distribution network (PDN) is becoming more significant due to the increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) and fast charging stations (FCSs). Accurately characterizing the dynamic coupling between TN and PDN is crucial. However, existing literature exhibits significant deficiencies in modeling the travel behaviors of gasoline vehicles (GVs) and EVs, as well as the propagation characteristics of mixed traffic networks. Moreover, it overlooks the queuing capacity limits of FCSs and the impact of queue overflow on TN. To address these issues, this study presents a stochastic dynamic user equilibrium (SDUE) modeling framework for coupled networks considering EVs charging behavior. This framework comprehensively captures the dynamic interactions among departure times, path choices, FCS choices, and electricity prices within the TN and PDN. To capture the traffic dynamics, a multi-class traffic flow propagation model for EVs and GVs, considering EV charging behavior, is developed. Additionally, an improved fixed-point algorithm is proposed to obtain the dynamic equilibrium state of the coupled networks. Case studies reveal that reducing FCS capacity degrades overall network performance. Therefore, it is essential to consider queue overflow when devising traffic policies to enhance network performance and assessing the layout of FCSs. Furthermore, the results indicate that the coupled operation strategy, in comparison to independent operation strategies, can reduce total traffic delay costs by 28.4%, decrease average waiting time at FCSs by 28.7%, and lower power losses by 11.7%. These findings underscore the significance of collaborative management and planning of TN and PDN in response to the escalating demand for EVs. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.tra.2025.104590,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.tra.2025.104590,18,high

We develop a framework that quantifies this flexibility across spatial and temporal dimensions, integrates real-world grid and travel constraints, and models this flexibility as virtual batteries and power lines. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan and San Francisco Bay areas, our analysis quantifies the vast value of this charging flexibility. In the Chicago case alone, this is equivalent to 740 MWh of battery storage and 15 MW of distribution lines—valued at $357 million and $565 million, respectively.

To address this, a multi-stage optimal allocation method for newly added electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) based on comprehensive service performance is proposed. First, an improved Huff model incorporating charging station attributes, travel time value, and individual user preferences analyses probabilistic charging behaviour to determine service range and charging demand. Second, a comprehensive evaluation method using power utilisation rate, effective service rate, and capacity redundancy is established, with indicator weights determined by an Analytic Hierarchy Process-Entropy Weight (AHP-EW) method integrated into a fuzzy theory-based scoring system. Third, an allocation model integrating comprehensive service evaluation from a combined operator-user economic perspective is formulated. Finally, an Immune Clone Selection–Variable Neighbourhood Search (ICS–VNS) hybrid algorithm is designed for efficient optimisation. Case studies demonstrate that, compared to the existing planning scheme, both the single-station and two-station deployment schemes reduce peak demands at existing busiest charging stations by 16.1% and 27.5%.

Flexible interconnection devices optimize line power flow, while energy routers (ERs) regulate node-level power. Their combination effectively addresses these challenges. This paper proposes a two-layer planning method integrating the rotary power flow controller (RPFC) and ER across spatial and temporal dimensions to improve economy and carrying capacity. RPFC advantages over other flexible devices are analysed, and mathematical models for RPFC and ER are developed. The upper layer minimizes total network cost for siting and sizing, while the lower layer coordinates operation using indicators of stability, balance, economy, and flexibility.

maybe,,Are EVs cleaner than we think? Evaluating consequential greenhouse gas emissions from EV charging,"While electrifying transportation eliminates tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electric vehicle (EV) adoption can create additional electricity sector emissions. To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption-average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions. © 2025 The Author(s).

This paper presents a two-stage framework to segment and forecast electric-vehicle (EV) charging behavior using spatio-temporal features extracted from one year of 15-minute telematics for 264 EVs in Saskatchewan, Canada. The feature set combines temporal usage (power/energy levels and variability) with spatial mobility (home-charging ratio, location diversity, travel distance and angular dispersion). We compare three complementary clustering families including Fuzzy C-Means (soft membership), Gaussian Mixtures (probabilistic partitions), and Hierarchical clustering (multiscale structure) and using algorithm-appropriate selection criteria (Xie–Beni, BIC, elbow/Calinski–Harabasz) to ensure a fair assessment.

Accurately identifying PEVs serves as a crucial prerequisite for the establishment of charging station infrastructure. Existing methods for PEV identification can be divided into two categories, i.e., knowledge-driven (KD) models and data-driven (DD) models. The former suffers from the impact of explicit features extracted by subjective experience on identification performance, while the implicit features obtained by the latter are sensitive to the quality of recorded data. An interpretable knowledge and data dual-driven (IKD-DD) model is, therefore, proposed to integrate the robustness and learning abilities of two kinds of models by a mutual information-guided joint training process. A multiattention (MA) mechanism is, moreover, adopted to fuse the explicit and implicit features to enhance the discrimination ability of the feature set instead of conventional feature concatenation. Besides, a prototype-based contrastive loss function was introduced to learn PEV charging behavior even with limited labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PEV load identification method achieves an identification accuracy exceeding 90% across various simulated and real datasets.

Charging station siting and sizing are two key challenges in the planning with each of them being a complex optimization problem. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to solve them together. First, considering that accurate charging demand estimation is crucial for planning, a traffic road network is established for this purpose. A Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of charging demand in a region based on the probabilistic characteristics of user trips. Since uncoordinated charging not only increases the load but also leads to unstable operation of the local power system, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to coordinate charging scheduling. Then, based on the scheduled demand, this paper proposes a framework for the siting and sizing of charging stations to optimize the benefits for both operators and users by minimizing the construction, operation and maintenance costs, and the user’s detour time. As the given problem is a complex multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, it is easy to fall into local optimum if traditional evolutionary algorithms are employed. Therefore, a multi-objective dynamic binary particle swarm optimization method is designed to solve this problem effectively.

Given a budget to be allocated over a certain time horizon, we formulate the joint spatio-temporal CSs and DGs planning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. During each planning period, the allocation strategy aims at minimizing the total power generation costs and CSs/DGs installation costs while satisfying budgetary and power constraints and ensuring a minimum level for the charging requests satisfaction rate. In this regard, we first predict the future power demand of EVs using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN).

maybe,,Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Distributed Generators in Smart Grids: A Multi-Objective Meta-Heuristic Approach,"The global transition towards electric mobility has significantly increased the demand for efficient and consumer-friendly Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs). As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to penetrate transportation systems, optimal integration of EVCSs within power distribution infrastructure becomes critical, not only to ensure seamless user experience but also to maintain the reliability and efficiency of electrical networks. Traditionally, EVCS planning has been carried out solely within the context of Radial Distribution Networks (RDNs), neglecting key consumer-centric factors such as travel comfort and accessibility within the road network (RN). This paper proposes a novel, consumer-aware methodology for optimally placing EVCSs and Distributed Generators (DGs) in a combined RDN-RN framework. The objective is to minimize active power loss, voltage variation, and EV consumer cost, measured through two proposed indices, while accounting for realistic travel behavior and preferences. The proposed approach utilizes a Modified Weighted Teaching Learning Based - Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (MWTLB-PSA) and proceeds in three stages: EVCS site selection based on road network considerations, DG placement using predetermined EVCS locations, and a final stage of simultaneous optimization of both elements. To validate the approach, a standard IEEE 33-bus RDN integrated with a 25-node RN is employed as the test system. Results demonstrate that the joint optimization of DGs and EVCSs via the proposed method significantly enhances network performance and consumer convenience.

maybe,,Secure and Semi-Decentralized Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Networking Strategy for Dynamic Wireless Charging of EVs,"Dynamic wireless charging (DWC) facilitates energy transfer from the electric grid to moving electric vehicles (EVs) via charging pads (CPs) positioned along roadways. To maximize satisfied charging requests, given the limited supply capacity, dynamic charging coordination is required to determine suitable CPs for mobile EVs. Charging coordination necessitates EV owners to share their information (i.e., the identities and locations) with charging service providers (CSPs) to allocate the best CP for charging. However, charging coordination raises privacy concerns due to the exchange of private information. Moreover, a fast authentication mechanism is then required between EVs and CPs to initiate the charging process. In addition to the privacy limitation, existing DWC strategies lack the presence of multiple CSPs, which is a crucial aspect given the significant growth of the EV market. Consequently, centralization arises, with a single CSP overseeing the entire network. This paper proposes a semi-decentralized privacy-preserving networking strategy utilizing a specially designed consortium blockchain to support dynamic charging coordination, authentication, and billing while ensuring user anonymity and data unlinkability. Our proposed strategy leverages a novel semi-decentralized K-times group signature scheme and distributed random number generators to achieve privacy and decentralization. Simulation results showed that the proposed method reduces the EV authentication time to 0.1 ms while limiting storage requirements to just 4 MB per block at each EV.

This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to construct a three-phase LV network model solely exploiting real smart meter data. Two multiple linear regression models combined with clustering techniques and Spearman correlation are employed to identify the network topology, line impedance, and phase groups. The proposed approach is tested on a real LV network (14 customers) from Victoria, Australia, and a set of 60 days of real smart meter data (V, I) with 5-min resolution. Results demonstrate that the construction of the LV network model can be done with a mean error of ±1 Volts (measurements vs power flow simulations).

maybe,,Battery Health-Informed and Policy-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for EV-Facilitated Distribution Grid Optimal Policy,"Electric vehicles play a crucial role in modern active distribution system operation, owing to their flexibility and mobility. The joint optimization of power grid operation and EV scheduling is expected to achieve better decision-making for both power and transportation systems. However, such joint optimization can suffer from high computational complexity and a lack of information about the other system. One possible approach for the power system operator is to assume the charging/discharging pattern of the EV population and make dispatch decisions based on such estimated EV profiles. This practice results in grid-level policies. The problem arises as whether the EV population complies with and fulfills the grid-level policies is not easy to monitor. To address this issue, we further investigate and expand upon the innovative concept of grid facilitation for electric vehicles (EVs). A newly designed probabilistic incentive signal is introduced to assist in implementing grid policies. Correspondingly, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for EV prosumer scheduling that effectively balances EV autonomy with the execution of grid policies. Cast as a demand response signal, the grid-level policy is capable of managing overall grid operation with the facilitation of individuals and decoupling the co-optimization of the operator and EV owner. For the DRL of the EV, the training reward considers both the EV operation cost and the grid facilitation incentive, featuring a dynamically shrinking EV battery’s feasible operation range in terms of voltages and currents, and the health-informed reward. The policy-aware reward utilizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify the gap between the actual EV power injection pattern and the system operator’s assumption.

The intermittent power flow subjects the grid to significant stress, potentially affecting grid stability. This study proposes a distinctive transmitter (Tx) structure and control method to smooth the power pulsation from the grid to the vehicle, downsizing the grid-side power electronics and cable ratings. An energy buffering unit is designed and connected to the DWPT inverter. An advanced inverter control strategy is proposed to regulate the inverter’s input and Tx coil currents simultaneously. The proposed solution solely utilizes the existing inverter; no additional conversion unit is needed. A comprehensive analysis of the system operation is presented, including the derivation of expressions for sizing the energy buffer (EB) components and defining the operational boundaries for the inverter’s dual-purpose control. In this work, a 22-kW control hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) setup and a 750-W benchtop scaled-down DWPT hardware prototype are developed for testing.

maybe,,Charging Station Sizing and Placement for EV Docking Station in Smart Grid,"Deploying electric vehicles (EVs) is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful gases generated by conventional engines. Unprecedented hike in fuel prices and environmental concerns have increased the usage of EVs for last-mile connectivity. An increase in the adoption of EVs also leads to an increase in the grid power demand. A typical EV docking station (EVDS) hosting EVs for last-mile connectivity is considered in this research. Hence, there is a need to locate EVDS, considering the optimal charging pattern of the EVs and the distance traveled. Initially, a ride-hailing company EVDS is modeled based on the type and level of charging. Based on charging profile observations from the advanced metering system, the EV charging system provider (CSP) must propose a suitable location for placing the docking stations corresponding to the energy required for charging the EV fleet. The proposed approach integrates an IEEE 69 Bus distribution network with a solar-powered EVDS. Integration makes use of solar energy as a primary or supplementary source for charging EVs, promoting sustainability and reducing reliance on the conventional grid. Solar photovoltaic (SPV) system-powered EVDS improves reliability and efficiency by reducing power losses. EVDS remains functional during peak demand or grid outages due to the distributed nature of SPV systems. The optimal placement of a solar-based EVDS in the IEEE 69 bus system will improve the charging time, system reliability, and greater utilization of renewable energy sources. Finally, the reliability test was carried out for the optimal placement of solar EVDS within an IEEE 69 BUS system. © © 2025 Sathieshkumar S. et al.

maybe,,A Novel Multiobjective Optimization Approach for EV Charging and Vehicle-to-Grid Scheduling Strategy,"In this study, we proposed a novel multiobjective optimization technique for electric vehicles’ (EVs) charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling. The ring seal search (RSS) algorithm ensures the optimum compatibility of the EV charging and discharging profiles revolving around multiple objectives, such as cost of charging, peak load demand reduction, and grid stability. The proposed algorithm is tested on the distribution model through the IEEE 33-bus system. A comprehensive model with real-time data from EV charging station operators (CSOs) is also ported in this research so that the EVs can be illustrated in the power distribution network. A convenient energy management strategy (EMS) called multiobjective optimization has been introduced to provide practical solutions for CSOs and EV users. The strategy had been developed based on multiple objectives to counter different trade-offs, including EV charging and discharging profiles suitable for numerous objectives encompassing charging costs, peak load demand reduction, and grid stability. The efficiency of the deterministic approach has been verified via extensive simulations and analysis, and the outcomes incorporate a definite enhancement in metrics since the RSS algorithm considerably optimized EV charging and V2G scheduling. The EV charging and discharging profiles had been optimized to take better advantage of available resource requirements by accommodating priority-based scheduling. The RSS will be able to investigate the modified parameter and the modified real system, which tells about the versatility and adaptability of the proposed method, i.e., it will be able to incorporate the changing implementation and its real-world efficacy, which is an immense merit for the adaptation of the real system. The proposed method offers a comprehensive, advanced EV charging and V2G scheduling solution. It addresses the limitations of previous methods by considering multiple objectives, utilizing a novel optimization algorithm, handling uncertainties, promoting renewable energy integration, and providing ancillary grid support.

However, their stochastic load characteristics on the radial distribution network (RDN) pose challenges such as power quality issues and increased network losses. This paper proposes an approach to strategically deploy EV charging stations (EVCS) integrated with photovoltaic (PV) units in RDN. The main objective is to reduce real power loss and enhance the reliability indices. The scenarios that include and exclude PV units have been considered to analyze the impact of introducing PV in the RDN with different EVCS loads. The capacity of the PV unit has also been optimized in this work. The proposed methodology has been assessed by using the IEEE 69 bus RDN. The IEEE 69 bus RDN has been divided into four zones and each zone consists of one EVCS and one PV to ensure widespread charging facilities and improve the network performance. The backward forward sweep power flow technique has been applied to perform the analysis by considering the variable parameters of the electrical system. The issues have been framed as an optimization task and tackled by applying the symbiotic organisms search technique. The outcomes have been compared with Grey Wolf Optimizer, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to validate the effectiveness of the optimal planning to allocate the EVCS and PV units. The methodology is validated through multiscenario optimization on the IEEE 69-bus system and a case study-based static and dynamic simulation on the IEEE 13-bus feeder.

maybe,,Modified GWO algorithm-based optimal power flow analysis integrated with renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles,"The increased integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into power systems brings new challenges in optimal power flow (OPF) management. These challenges arise primarily due to the intermittent nature of RESs and the unpredictable charging/discharging patterns of PEVs. As power systems transition towards low-carbon and decentralized power networks, achieving efficient and cost-effective OPF solutions has become a critical priority. Standard optimization algorithms like particle swarm optimization, grey wolf optimization suffer from premature convergence, imbalanced exploration-exploitation, and limited solution diversity, resulting in suboptimal OPF solutions. To address these limitations, this study proposed modified grey wolf optimization (MGWO), selected for its minimal control parameters, enhanced exploration-exploitation using greedy selection, and improved convergence through dynamic leader selection. Uncertainty in RESs and PEVs is modelled using Monte Carlo methods with probability density functions (Weibull, lognormal, and normal distributions), enabling realistic and robust OPF solutions. The proposed algorithm is validated on standard and modified IEEE 30 and 57-bus systems. Comparative and statistical analysis, reinforced by one-way ANOVA test, confirms that MGWO significantly reduces operating cost, emissions, and voltage deviation compared to standard grey wolf optimization, multi-verse optimizer, and arithmetic optimization algorithm. The results underscore MGWO’s potential for power system planning, grid stability, and economic dispatch under high-RESs and PEV penetration scenarios. © The Author(s) 2025",10.1177/0309524X251345549,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1177/0309524x251345549,18,high

This study focuses on the problem of vehicle charging dispatch to make a breakthrough, deeply analyzes the effect and efficiency of the clean energy grid, and then proposes a series of targeted measures to effectively improve the operational efficiency and reliability of the energy system. The comprehensive model integrates electric vehicle charging stations, distributed photovoltaic power generation systems, wind farms, and battery energy storage devices and enables the charging process to be accurately controlled with real-time monitoring and intelligent algorithms. In particular, the demand forecasting model based on machine learning effectively solves the dilemma of matching the charging load with a clean energy supply. Experimental data strongly confirms that the optimization strategy has led to a 15% reduction in peak load on the grid, a 23% increase in the proportion of clean energy consumption, and a 10% reduction in total electricity consumption. For policymakers, these achievements can be used as a guide to help formulate energy policies and build a framework for adapting to the development of new energy.

maybe,,Impact of electric vehicle charging demand on clean energy regional power grid control,"In the context of global response to climate change and promoting energy transformation, the rapid popularization of electric vehicles and the widespread application of clean energy have become important components of modern power systems. However, the charging demand of electric vehicles brings new challenges to regional power grids, especially those that rely on clean energy, due to its uncertainty and randomness. This study examines the impact of EV charging demand on the control efficiency of clean energy-based regional power grids. Using real grid data and time-series simulation, we develop a dispatch optimization framework incorporating a master-slave game model based on wind power output distribution. We simulate EV charging patterns, renewable fluctuations, and uncertainties in user behavior and station availability. The results show that unmanaged charging increases peak load by up to 20%, while optimized strategies like Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing, Direct Load Control (DLC), and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) reduce the peak-valley gap by 15%, improve renewable energy consumption by 12%, and lower curtailment. These findings offer valuable insights for EV integration and clean energy planning in regional grids. The results show that at a 30% EV penetration rate, the peak charging demand may lead to a 20% increase in the regional grid load, and by optimizing the charging time, the peak-valley load difference can be reduced by 15%. In addition, a reasonable charging strategy can help improve the utilization rate of clean energy, maximize the consumption of wind power and photovoltaic power generation, and reduce dependence on fossil fuel power generation. © The Author(s) 2025.",10.1186/s42162-025-00538-0,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1186/s42162-025-00538-0,18,high

maybe,,Optimal Sizing of Photovoltaic and Battery Energy Storage Systems Incorporating Constant Current and Constant Power Load Models,"Load modelling is critical in power system analysis, significantly affecting voltage stability, power flow, and the sizing and placement of Distributed Generators (DGs). Current research has primarily focused on optimal sizing methodologies for DGs and battery energy storage systems, predominantly utilizing constant load models. This approach fails to capture the dynamic and non-linear characteristics of actual load behaviour, which affects the voltage stability. The practical loads are composed of ZIP loads (Constant Impedance Load -CIL-‘Z’, Constant Current Load- CCL-‘I’ and Constant Power Load-CPL-‘P’). In this context, this research evaluates the effect of CCL and CPL modelling on the optimal sizing of system components, particularly in light of the growing prevalence of battery-operated loads. The study proposes an optimal system size designed to accommodate the diverse load demands represented by ZIP loads affecting system voltage across various applications, including residential, industrial, commercial, and agricultural settings. The analysis is conducted using the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization technique with consideration of a ±5% variation in the system’s rated voltage. The present study evaluated the minimum total annual cost over a twenty-year timeframe, utilizing actual site data. The results indicate a maximum number of system components in the agricultural load due to the dominating CPL. The results also propose the inclusion of 10% CCL in residential, industrial, and commercial loads due to the increasing reliance on battery-operated systems: electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. © 2025 Seventh Sense Research Group®.

Fast charging stations (FCSs), due to their high energy demand, further complicate grid operation, particularly in maintaining voltage stability and coordinating power supply. While previous studies often address DERs placement or control strategies in isolation, this study proposes a unified framework that optimizes both the placement and sizing of DERs in combination with advanced grid control mechanisms. The proposed approach uses a hybrid of three metaheuristic algorithms: Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The multi-objective formulation focuses on minimizing power loss and cost, improving voltage profiles, and reducing the L-index. A notable contribution of this work is the integration of Volt/Var and power factor (PF) management into the optimization process, which enables practical grid stabilization under steady-state conditions. The methodology is applied to the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and validated through simulation. Results indicate that the hybrid method performs better than traditional single-algorithm approaches, achieving significant power loss reductions and voltage improvements.

The popularity of EVs brings the need for power supply to integrate renewable energy resources and energy storage devices to enhance the operational efficiency of the power system. This article presents a static simulation approach that tries to improve the placement and sizing of PV and BESS systems in the IEEE 33 bus test system for different penetration levels of EVs. The suggested method utilizes a Multi-Objective Monte Carlo (MOMC) simulation technique to assess various scenarios, specifically reducing total power losses, system cost, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions while guaranteeing voltage stability within predetermined thresholds. The simulation scheme combines dynamic PV output, accurately representing the daily solar generating cycles. In addition, it contains extra EV loads to model the increased penetration on the power distribution system. The research proposes specific spots within the power grid to place PV and BESS systems and applies zoning restrictions during the optimization computation step. The objective function imposes voltage violation fines; therefore, compliance with operational requirements is ensured. The findings indicate substantial decreases in power wastage and CO2 emissions at various levels of EV adoption (30, 50, and 70%). The most efficient PV and BESS systems setup change depending on the level of adoption of EVs, emphasizing the need for flexible approaches in constructing distribution networks.

However, a single type of charging or swapping facility cannot simultaneously and efficiently satisfy the power supply requirements of diverse vehicle types. In order to solve this problem, a joint planning method of charging piles and charging-battery swapping stations (CBSSs) is proposed in this paper. In this method, the influence of geospatial constraints on the layout scale of charging piles is considered, and the Monte Carlo simulation method is used to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of charging and battery swapping demands of private electric vehicles (PEVs) and the battery swapping demands of taxi electric vehicles (TEVs) respectively. On this basis, the layout scale of charging piles of each functional area is determined during the maximum charging demand period in a day to meet the demands of PEVs for charging convenience. Then, an operating state model of CBSS is established for calculation of the objective function. At the same time, a planning model of CBSSs is established to minimize the annual social comprehensive cost, which takes into account the economy of CBSSs and the battery swapping convenience of EVs. The planning of CBSSs can meet the demands of TEVs and some PEVs for a rapid power supply. Finally, using the urban transportation network of Changchun and IEEE 33-node system as an example, the planning of charging piles and CCBSs in direct charging mode and peak shifting mode are simulated and analyzed.

However, due to the current low rural electric vehicle ownership, the charging price compensation mechanism is not yet perfect, resulting in the planning period of electric vehicle growth and the willingness to respond to the tariff compensation policy is difficult to accurately assess. Methods: This paper proposes a rural photovoltaic storage and charging integrated charging station capacity allocation strategy based on the tariff compensation mechanism. Firstly, we construct a spatial-temporal dynamic distribution model of rural EV charging load coupled with distribution network - transportation network, and on this basis, we consider the rural EV charging time-sharing tariff and tariff compensation policy incentive, and amend the EV charging load transfer model; and then we construct an optimization planning model of charging station with the goal of minimizing the cost of construction, operation and maintenance, and maximizing the charging benefit of the integrated charging station in the rural area, and obtain the optimal synergistic planning scheme under the tariff compensation mechanism in the planning period. Results: The optimal collaborative planning scheme under the electricity price compensation mechanism is obtained, and the correctness and validity of the proposed optimal planning method of the rural optical storage charging station under the electricity price compensation mechanism is verified by the example, which is of positive significance in the promotion of the charging facilities to go to the countryside in an appropriate manner, and in the stimulation of the willingness of the rural consumers in the townships to purchase vehicles. Conclusion: (1) The spatial and temporal distribution and transfer model of rural EV charging loads with price incentives is constructed by taking into account the preferential charging price policies such as rural time-sharing tariff and tariff compensation mechanism. By comparing the operating revenues of optical storage-charging integrated charging stations with and without time-sharing tariffs and tariff compensation policies, we verified the incentive effect of multiple types of price incentives for the over-planning of rural electric vehicle charging facilities. (2) The proposed optimal configuration method of rural photovoltaic, storage and charging integration charging station can realize the in-situ utilization of rural renewable energy, tap the price competitiveness of photovoltaic, storage and charging integration, and weaken the cost of electricity consumption. By comparing the optimized configuration scheme with and without joint planning, it is verified that the moderate configuration of in-situ photovoltaic and energy storage equipment on the basis of the planning of charging piles brings benefits far exceeding the investment cost, and has a great role in increasing the operational efficiency of rural charging facilities. © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.",10.2174/0123520965274991231219060505,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.2174/0123520965274991231219060505,18,high

Firstly, a Bayesian adaptive spline surface based sensitivity analysis method is employed to quantify the impact of pricing on road congestion rates. In the intraday market, a dynamic pricing strategy, guided by sensitivity analysis, is designed to influence EV traffic flow with minimal price adjustments. This optimizes BCS revenue in energy and reserve capacity markets while alleviating traffic congestion and reducing the communication burden. In the real-time market, a game-based subjective and objective evaluation method is developed to assess the response characteristics of BCSs considering factors such as communication delays, regulation capacity, and market revenue, enabling an equitable allocation of frequency regulation tasks among BCSs.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes an adaptive multi-objective energy management strategy that accounts for the distinct operational requirements of distribution networks with a high penetration of new-type source-loads. The goal is to establish a comprehensive energy management framework that optimally balances energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and economic performance in modern distribution networks. To enhance classification accuracy, the strategy constructs a multi-dimensional scenario classification model that integrates environmental and climatic factors by analyzing the operational characteristics of new-type distribution networks and incorporating expert knowledge. An improved split-coupling K-means pre-clustering algorithm is employed to classify distribution networks effectively. Based on the classification results, fuzzy logic control is then utilized to dynamically optimize the weighting of each objective, allowing for an adaptive adjust-ment of priorities to achieve a flexible and responsive multi-objective energy management strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through practical case studies. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy by 18.18% compared to traditional classification methods and enhances energy savings and carbon reduction by 4.34% and 20.94%, respectively, compared to the fixed-weight strategy. © 2025 The Authors.

maybe,,A coordinated optimization model for analysis of electric vehicle acceptance capacity considering compensation units,"Introduction: Promoting the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is widely recognized as an effective strategy for addressing environmental challenges. Consequently, the expansion of EV charging infrastructure is necessary to enhance the user experience and accommodate the increasing demand. However, without careful consideration of optimal site selection and capacity planning, the integration of EV charging loads may induce significant overcapacity and voltage fluctuating issues. Methods: This paper presents a coordinated optimization model for assessing the integration acceptance capacity of EV charging loads within distribution networks. The model is based on linear power flow equations and incorporates the compensatory capabilities of the distribution network. Results and discussion: A case study is conducted to evaluate the acceptance capacity of two distinct types of EV charging loads within the IEEE 33-bus benchmark network. Additionally, the paper examines the impact of various system expansion strategies on the acceptance capacity, considering the aggregation of different units. The results indicate that energy storage systems (ESSs) and static var generators (SVGs) exert the most significant influence on the network’s ability to accommodate EV charging loads. © © 2025 Chen, Zhang, Chen, Li, Fu and Sui.",10.3389/fenrg.2025.1540735,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3389/fenrg.2025.1540735,18,high
maybe,,Development and Analysis of a Fast-Charge EV-Charging Station Model for Power Quality Assessment in Distribution Systems,"With the rapid rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, the deployment of EV charging infrastructure—particularly fast-charging stations—has expanded significantly to meet growing energy demands. While fast charging offers the advantage of reduced charging time and improved user convenience, it imposes considerable stress on existing power distribution systems due to its high power and current requirements. This study investigated the impact of EV fast charging on power quality within Thailand’s distribution network, emphasizing compliance with accepted standards such as IEEE Std 519-2014. We developed a control-oriented EV-charging station model in power systems computer-aided design and electromagnetic transients, including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC), which integrates grid-side vector control with DC fast-charging (CC/CV) behavior. Active/reactive power setpoints were mapped onto (Formula presented.) current references via Park’s transformation and regulated by proportional integral (PI) controllers with sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM) to command the voltage source converter (VSC) switches. The model enabled dynamic studies across battery state-of-charge and staggered charging schedules while monitoring voltage, current, and total harmonic distortion (THD) at both transformer sides, charger AC terminals, and DC adapters. Across all scenarios, the developed control achieved grid-current THDi of <5% and voltage THD of <1.5%, thereby meeting IEEE 519-2014 limits. These quantitative results show that the proposed, implementation-ready approach maintains acceptable power quality under diverse fast-charging patterns and provides actionable guidance for planning and scaling EV fast-charging infrastructure in Thailand’s urban networks. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/app15179645,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/app15179645,18,high
maybe,,A Nash Equilibrium-Based Strategy for Optimal DG and EVCS Placement and Sizing in Radial Distribution Networks,"Distribution System Operators (DSOs) increasingly need planning tools that coordinate utility-influenced assets—such as electric-vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and voltage-support resources—with customer-sited distributed generation (DG). We present a Nash-equilibrium-based Iterative Best Response Algorithm (IBRA-NE) for joint planning of DG and EVCS in radial distribution networks. The framework supports two applicability modes: (i) a DSO-plannable mode that co-optimizes EVCS siting/sizing and utility-controlled reactive support (DG operated as VAR resources or functionally equivalent devices), and (ii) a customer-sited mode that treats DG locations as fixed while optimizing DG reactive set-points/sizes and EVCS siting. The objective minimizes network losses and voltage deviation while incorporating deployment costs and EV charging service penalties, subject to standard operating limits. A backward/forward sweep (BFS) load flow with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) captures load and generation uncertainty; a Bus Voltage Deviation Index (BVDI) helps identify weak buses. On the EEU 114-bus system, the method reduces base-case losses by up to 57.9% and improves minimum bus voltage from 0.757 p.u. to 0.931 p.u.; performance remains robust under a 20% load increase. The framework explicitly accommodates regulatory contexts where DG siting is customer-driven by treating DG locations as fixed in such cases while optimizing EVCS siting and sizing under DSO planning authority. A mixed scenario with 5 DGs and 3 EVCS demonstrates coordinated benefits and convergence properties relative to PSO, GWO, RFO, and ARFO. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is also tested on the IEEE 69-bus system and results in acceptable performance. The results indicate that game-theoretic coordination, applied in a manner consistent with regulatory roles, provides a practical pathway for DSOs to plan EV infrastructure and reactive support in networks with uncertain DER behavior. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/app15179668,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/app15179668,18,high
maybe,,Optimal Layout Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Considering Road–Electricity Coupling Effects,"With the advancement of dual-carbon goals and the construction of new types of power systems, the proportion of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) in the coupling system of power distribution and transportation networks is gradually increasing. However, the surge in charging demand not only causes voltage fluctuations and a decline in power quality but also leads to tension in the power grid load in some areas. The complexity of urban road networks further increases the challenge of charging station planning. Although laying out charging stations in areas with high traffic flow can better meet traffic demands, it may also damage power quality due to excessive grid load. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an optimized layout plan for electric vehicle charging stations considering the coupling effects of roads and electricity. By using section power flow to extract dynamic data from the power distribution network and comparing the original daily load curves of the power grid and electric vehicles, this paper plans reasonable capacity and charging/discharging schemes for EVCSs. It considers the impact of the charging and discharging characteristics of EVCSs on the power grid while satisfying the peak-shaving and valley-filling regulation benefits. Combined with the traffic road network, the optimization objectives include optimizing the voltage deviation, transmission line margin, network loss, traffic flow, and service range of charging stations. The Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is used for solving, and the optimal layout plan for electric vehicle charging stations is obtained. Finally, through road–electricity coupling network simulation verification, the proposed optimal planning scheme effectively expands the charging service range of electric vehicles, with a coverage rate of 83.33%, alleviating users’ charging anxiety and minimizing the impact on the power grid, verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/electronics14010135,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/electronics14010135,18,high
maybe,,Integrated Multi-Timescale Battery Dispatch and Overload Mitigation: An Agent-Based Optimization Framework for High EV Penetration in Danish Distribution Networks,"The rapid integration of renewable energy and electric vehicles is challenging modern distribution networks with increased demand volatility and overload risks. To address these issues, we propose an integrated, multi-timescale battery dispatch framework that unifies long-term capacity planning, day-ahead/intra-day scheduling, and sub-minute real-time control. The framework combines HOMER Pro-based capacity sizing, a MISOCP model for economic scheduling, and an agent-based simulation for immediate overload mitigation. In a case study of a Danish distribution network projected to reach full EV penetration by 2034, our approach reduced moderate-to-severe overload incidents by 82.7%. Furthermore, a price-sensitive variant achieved a 27.4% reduction in operational costs, with only a 12.5% increase in minor overload events. These quantitative improvements, alongside qualitative enhancements in grid stability and battery longevity, provide actionable insights for distribution system operators. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/electronics14081612,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/electronics14081612,18,high
maybe,,Eco-Cooperative Planning and Control of Connected Autonomous Vehicles Considering Energy Consumption Characteristics,"Cooperative driving systems can coordinate individual vehicles on the road in a platoon, holding significant promise for enhancing traffic efficiency and lowering the energy consumption of vehicle movements. For an extended period, vehicles on the road will consist of a mix of traditional gasoline and electric vehicles. To explore the economic driving strategies for diverse vehicles on the road, this paper introduces a collaborative eco-driving system that takes into account the energy consumption traits of vehicles. Unlike prior research, this paper puts forward a lane change decision-making approach that integrates energy modeling and speed prediction. This method can effectively capture the speed variations in the vehicle ahead and facilitate lane changes with energy efficiency in mind. The system encompasses three vital functions: vehicle cooperative architecture, ecological trajectory planning, and power system control. Specifically, eco-speed planning is carried out in two stages: the initial stage is executed globally, with cooperative speed optimization performed based on the energy consumption characteristics of different vehicles to determine the economical speed for vehicle platoon driving. The subsequent stage involves local speed adaptation, where the vehicle platoon dynamically adjusts its speed and makes lane change decisions according to local driving conditions. Ultimately, the generated control information is fed into the powertrain control system to regulate the vehicle. To assess the proposed collaborative eco-driving system, the algorithms were tested on highways, and the results substantiated the system’s efficacy in reducing the energy consumption of vehicle driving. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/electronics14081646,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/electronics14081646,18,high
maybe,,Interaction Scenarios Considering Source–Grid–Load–Storage for Distribution Network with Multiple Subjects and Intelligent Transportation Systems,"With the spread of electric vehicles (EVs), the EV load will have a significant impact on the planning and operation of the grid and the operation of the electricity market. Due to the charging and discharging characteristics of EVs, as well as their randomness and dispersion, it is feasible and challenging to introduce EV loads into the grid as a means of frequency regulation and peak shaving of the power system. In this paper, considering multi-subject distribution networks and the interaction of source–grid–load–storage with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), a density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm based on principal component analysis is employed to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of EV loads and identify the access status of EV charging stations and EV load status in each region in real time, as well as analyze the adjustable capacity and adjustable range of EV loads. Based on the adjustable capacity of the EV load, the optimization objectives include the maximum regulation of the EV load and the most economical operation cost. An accurate load regulation strategy based on automatic active control (APC) is proposed to reduce the maximum frequency deviation by 25% by integrating the load regulation of electric vehicles into the original AGC frequency regulation. At the same time, the feasibility of electric vehicles in peaking and standby scenarios is studied and verified through simulation cases, which can reduce the peak value of thermal power generation by 15% and 10% in the morning and evening. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/electronics14091860,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/electronics14091860,18,high
maybe,,Impact Analysis and Optimal Placement of Distributed Energy Resources in Diverse Distribution Systems for Grid Congestion Mitigation and Performance Enhancement,"The integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, battery energy storage systems (BESSs), and electric vehicles (EVs) introduces new challenges to distribution networks despite offering opportunities for decarbonization and grid flexibility. This paper proposes a scalable simulation-based framework that combines deterministic nodal hosting capacity analysis with probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate and optimize DER integration in diverse feeder types. The methodology is demonstrated using the IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus test systems under full-year time-series simulations. Deterministic hosting capacity analysis shows that individual nodes can accommodate up to 76% of base load from PV sources, while Monte Carlo analysis reveals a network-wide average hosting capacity of 62%. Uncoordinated DER deployment leads to increased system losses, overvoltages, and thermal overloads. In contrast, coordinated integration achieves up to 38.7% reduction in power losses, 25% peak demand shaving, and voltage improvements from 0.928 p.u. to 0.971 p.u. Additionally, congestion-centric optimization reduces thermal overload indices by up to 65%. This framework aids utilities and policymakers in making informed decisions on DER planning by capturing both spatial and stochastic constraints. Its modular design allows for flexible adaptation across feeder scales and configurations. The results highlight the need for node-specific deployment strategies and probabilistic validation to ensure reliable, efficient DER integration. Future work will incorporate optimization-driven control and hardware-in-the-loop testing to support real-time implementation. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/electronics14101998,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/electronics14101998,18,high
maybe,,Assessment of Distribution Network Hosting Capacity Incorporating Multiple Uncertainty Factors,"The integration of distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicles (EVs) introduces significant uncertainties, challenging traditional deterministic methods for assessing distribution network hosting capacity. This paper proposes a novel hosting capacity assessment method that integrates stochastic scenario simulation with multi-dimensional risk quantification. The core innovation lies in constructing a comprehensive risk indicator system spanning security, reliability, and the economy. These indicators are aggregated using a combined weighting method to derive a comprehensive risk index. Applied to the IEEE 33-node system, the method identifies an optimal hosting capacity of 3.9 MW and a maximum hosting capacity of 5.201 MW under a defined acceptable risk threshold. This maximum capacity represents a 33.36% increase over the security-risk-only optimal hosting capacity of 3.715 MW, effectively quantifying the trade-off between capacity integration and operational risk.

maybe,,Adaptive Hosting Capacity Forecasting in Distribution Networks with Distributed Energy Resources,"The sustainable integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into distribution networks requires accurate forecasting of hosting capacity. The network and DER variables alone do not capture the full range of external influences on DER integration. Traditional models often overlook the dynamic impacts of these exogenous factors, leading to suboptimal predictions. This study introduces a Sensitivity-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (SERNN) model, featuring a sensitivity gate within the neural network’s memory cell architecture to enhance responsiveness to time-varying variables. The sensitivity gate dynamically adjusts the model’s response based on external conditions, allowing for improved capture of input variability and temporal characteristics of the distribution network and DER. Additionally, a feedback mechanism within the model provides inputs from previous cell states into the forget gate, allowing for refined control over input selection and enhancing forecasting precision. Through case studies, the model demonstrates superior accuracy in hosting capacity predictions compared to baseline models like LSTM, ConvLSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, Stacked LSTM, and GRU. Study shows that the SERNN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.2030, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3884 and an R-squared value of 0.9854, outperforming the best baseline model by 48 per cent in MAE and 71 per cent in RMSE. Additionally, Feature engineering enhances the model’s performance, improving the R-squared value from 0.9145 to 0.9854. The sensitivity gate also impacts the model’s performance, lowering MAE to 0.2030 compared to 0.2283 without the sensitivity gate, and increasing the R-squared value from 0.9152 to 0.9854. Incorporating exogenous factors such as the time of day as a sensitivity gate input, further improves responsiveness, making the model more adaptable to real-world conditions. This advanced SERNN model offers a reliable framework for distribution network operators, supporting intelligent planning and proactive DER management. Ultimately, it provides a significant step forward in hosting capacity analysis, enabling more efficient and sustainable DER integration within next-generation distribution networks. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18020263,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18020263,18,high
maybe,,Analysis of Techno–Economic and Social Impacts of Electric Vehicle Charging Ecosystem in the Distribution Network Integrated with Solar DG and DSTATCOM,"In this work, a comprehensive planning framework for an electric vehicle charging ecosystem (EVCE) is developed, incorporating solar distributed generation (DG) and a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM), to assess their long-term techno–economic and environmental impacts. The optimal locations and capacities of the EVCE, solar DG, and DSTATCOM are determined using an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the success rate technique. The study aims to maximize the technical, financial, and social benefits while ensuring that all security constraints are met. To assess the financial viability of the proposed model over a 10-year horizon, a detailed economic analysis comprising installation cost, operation, and maintenance cost is conducted. To make the model more realistic, various practical parameters, such as the inflation rate and interest rate, are incorporated during the financial analysis. Additionally, to highlight the societal benefits of the approach, the study quantifies the long-term carbon emissions and the corresponding cost of emissions. The proposed framework is tested on both a 33-bus distribution network and a 108-bus Indian distribution network.

maybe,,Electric Vehicle and Soft Open Points Co-Planning for Active Distribution Grid Flexibility Enhancement,"With the increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG), the supply–demand imbalance and voltage overruns in the distribution network have intensified, and there is an urgent need to introduce flexibility resources for regulation. This paper proposes co-planning of electric vehicles (EVs) and soft opening points (SOPs) to improve the flexibility of the active distribution network, thereby improving the economics and flexibility of the distribution network. Firstly, this paper establishes a charging pile day-ahead dispatchable prediction model and a real-time dispatchable potential assessment model through Monte Carlo sampling simulation. It replaces the traditional energy storage model with this model and then solves the EV and SOP collaborative planning model using a second-order conical planning algorithm with the objective function of minimizing the annual integrated cost. At the same time, the flexibility of the distribution network is analyzed by two indicators: power supply and demand balance and branch load margin. Finally, the optimization method proposed in this paper is analyzed and validated on an improved IEEE 33-node distribution system. Example results show that the planning method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the annual comprehensive operating cost of distribution networks, meet the flexibility index, and be conducive to improving the economy and flexibility of distribution network operation. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18030694,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18030694,18,high
maybe,,Planning for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure in Distribution Networks to Support Long-Range Electric Trucks,"Electrification of the transport sector introduces operational issues in the electricity distribution network, such as excessive voltage deviation, substation overloading, and adverse power quality impacts on other network loads. These concerns are expected to grow as electrification expands to incorporate heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses due to their greater energy requirements and higher charging loads. Two strategies are proposed to support medium- and heavy-duty chargers which address their high power demand and mitigate power quality disturbances and the overloading of substations. The first is a dedicated feeder connected at the secondary of the substation directly to the charging station which aims to reduce the impact of high load on other customers. The second is the addition of a dedicated substation that solely provides power for charging stations in major corridors, alleviating stress on existing zone substations. Hosting capacity is measured using a voltage deviation index, describing the deviation in line voltage, which should experience a sag of no more than 6% of the nominal voltage, and a substation charging capacity index, describing the available capacity of each zone substation as a ratio of its total power capacity. Verification of the proposed strategies was performed on an MV-LV distribution network representative of an industrial Australian town with heavy-vehicle charging. Results showed that the network could handle ten 250 kW chargers, which was tripled to 35 with a dedicated feeder. The dedicated feeder alternatively allowed up to 10 megawatt-scale chargers, which was again tripled when a dedicated substation was introduced. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18040785,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18040785,18,high
maybe,,A Model Predictive Control to Improve Grid Resilience,"The following article details a model predictive control (MPC) to improve grid resilience when faced with variable generation resources. This topic is of significant interest to utility power systems where distributed intermittent energy sources will increase significantly and be relied on for electric grid ancillary services. Previous work on MPCs has focused on narrowly targeted control applications such as improving electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure or reducing the cost of integrating Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) into the grid. In contrast, this article develops a comprehensive treatment of the construction of an MPC tailored to electric grids and then applies it integration of intermittent energy resources. To accomplish this, the following article includes a description of a reduced order model (ROM) of an electric power grid based on a circuit model, an optimization formulation that describes the MPC, a collocation method for solving linear time-dependent differential algebraic equations (DAEs) that result from the ROM, and an overall strategy for iteratively refining the behavior of the MPC. Next, the algorithm is validated using two separate numerical experiments. First, the algorithm is compared to an existing MPC code and the results are verified by a numerically precise simulation. It is shown that this algorithm produces a control comparable to existing algorithms and the behavior of the control carefully respects the bounds specified. Second, the MPC is applied to a small nine bus system that contains a mix of turbine-spinning-machine-based and intermittent generation in order to demonstrate the algorithm’s utility for resource planning and control of intermittent resources. This study demonstrates how the MPC can be tuned to change the behavior of the control, which can then assist with the integration of intermittent resources into the grid. The emphasis throughout the paper is to provide systematic treatment of the topic and produce a novel nonlinear control compatible design framework applicable to electric grids and the control of variable resources. This differs from the more targeted application-based focus in most presentations. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18071865,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18071865,18,high
maybe,,Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Voltage Coordination Control Strategy for Distribution Networks with High Photovoltaic Penetration,"With the increasing penetration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs) in distribution networks (DNs), issues like voltage violations and fluctuations are becoming more prominent. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal adaptive voltage coordination control strategy involving multiple timescales and multi-device collaboration. Aiming at the heavy workload caused by the continuous sampling of real-time data in the whole domain, an intra-day innovative construction of intra-day minute-level optimization and real-time adaptive control double-layer control mode are introduced. Intra-day minute-level refinement of on-load tap changer (OLTC) and step voltage regulator (SVR) day-ahead scheduling plans to fully utilize OLTC and SVR voltage regulation capabilities and improve voltage quality is discussed. In real-time adaptive control, a regional autonomy mechanism based on the functional area voltage quality risk prognostication coefficient (VQRPC) is innovatively proposed, where each functional area intelligently selects the time period for real-time voltage regulation of distributed battery energy storage systems (DESSs) based on VQRPC value, in order to improve real-time voltage quality while reducing the data sampling workload. Aiming at the state of charge (SOC) management of DESS, a novel functional area DESS available capacity management mechanism is proposed to coordinate DESS output and improve SOC homogenization through dynamically updated power–capacity availability (PCA). And vine model threshold band (VMTB) and deviation optimization management (DOM) strategies based on functional area are innovatively proposed, where DOM optimizes DESS output through the VMTB to achieve voltage fluctuation suppression while optimizing DESS available capacity. Finally, the DESS and electric vehicle (EV) cooperative voltage regulation mechanism is constructed to optimize DESS capacity allocation, and the black-winged kite algorithm (BKA) is used to manage DESS output. The results of a simulation on a modified IEEE 33 system show that the proposed strategy reduces the voltage fluctuation rate of each functional area by an average of 36.49%, reduces the amount of data collection by an average of 68.31%, and increases the available capacity of DESS by 5.8%, under the premise of a 100% voltage qualification rate. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18082093,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18082093,18,high
maybe,,Empirical EV Load Model for Distribution Network Analysis,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have introduced new operational challenges for distribution network service providers (DNSPs), particularly for voltage regulation due to unpredictable charging behaviour and the intermittent nature of distributed energy resources (DERs). This study focuses on formulating an empirical EV load model that characterises charging behaviour over a broad spectrum of supply voltage magnitudes to enable more accurate representation of EV demand under varying grid conditions. The empirical model is informed by laboratory evaluation of one Level 1 and two Level 2 chargers, along with five EV models. The testing revealed that all the chargers operated in a constant current (CC) mode across the applied voltage range, except for certain Level 2 chargers, which transitioned to constant power (CP) operation at voltages above 230 V. A model of a typical low voltage network has been developed using the OpenDSS software package (version 10.2.0.1) to evaluate the performance of the proposed empirical load model against traditional CP load modelling. In addition, a 24 h case study is presented to provide insights into the practical implications of increasing EV charging load. The results demonstrate that the CP model consistently overestimated network demand and voltage drops and failed to capture the voltage-dependent behaviour of EV charging in response to source voltage change. In contrast, the empirical model provided a more realistic reflection of network response, offering DNSPs improved accuracy for system planning. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18133494,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18133494,18,high
maybe,,A Two-Stage Stochastic Unit Commitment Model for Sustainable Large-Scale Power System Planning Under Renewable and EV Variability,"The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles have introduced considerable uncertainty into the operation of large-scale power systems. Traditional deterministic unit commitment models are insufficient for managing such variability in a reliable and cost-effective manner. This study proposes a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model that captures uncertainties in solar photovoltaic generation, electric vehicle charging demand, and load fluctuations using a mixed-integer linear programming framework with recourse. The model is applied to Thailand’s national power system, comprising 171 generators across five regions, to assess its scalability for sustainable large-scale planning. Results indicate that the stochastic model significantly enhances system reliability across most demand profiles. Under the Winter Weekday group, the number of lacking scenarios decreases by 76.92 percent and the number of missing periods decreases by 78.57 percent, while the average and maximum lack percentages are reduced by 56.32 percent and 72.61 percent, respectively. Improvements are even greater under the Rainy Weekday group, where lacking scenarios and periods decline by more than 92 percent and the maximum lack percentage falls by over 98 percent, demonstrating the model’s robustness under volatile solar output and load conditions. Although minor anomalies are observed, such as slight increases in average and maximum lack percentages in the Summer Weekday group, these are minimal and likely attributable to randomness in scenario generation or boundary effects in optimization. Overall, the stochastic model provides substantial advantages in managing uncertainty, achieving notable improvements in reliability with only modest increases in operational cost and computational time. The findings confirm that the proposed approach offers a robust and practical framework for supporting sustainable and resilient power systems in regions with high variability in both generation and demand. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18174614,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18174614,18,high

maybe,,Multi-Objective Collaborative Optimization of Distribution Networks with Energy Storage and Electric Vehicles Using an Improved NSGA-II Algorithm,"Grid-based distribution networks represent an advanced form of smart grids that enable modular, region-specific optimization of power resource allocation. This paper presents a novel planning framework aimed at the coordinated deployment of distributed generation, electrical loads, and energy storage systems, including both dispatchable and non-dispatchable electric vehicles. A three-dimensional objective system is constructed, incorporating investment cost, reliability metrics, and network loss indicators, forming a comprehensive multi-objective optimization model. To solve this complex planning problem, an improved version of the NSGA-II is employed, integrating hybrid encoding, feasibility constraints, and fuzzy decision-making for enhanced solution quality. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to validate its practicality. Simulation results demonstrate that the framework effectively addresses key challenges in modern distribution networks, including renewable intermittency, dynamic load variation, resource coordination, and computational tractability. It significantly enhances system operational efficiency and electric vehicles charging flexibility under varying conditions.

maybe,,Energy-Efficient Last-Mile Logistics Using Resistive Grid Path Planning Methodology (RGPPM),"Last-mile logistics is a critical operational and environmental challenge in urban areas. This paper introduces an intelligent path planning system using the Resistive Grid Path Planning Methodology (RGPPM) to optimize distribution based on energy and environmental metrics. The foundational innovation is the integration of electrical-circuit analogies, modeling the distribution network as a resistive grid where optimal routes emerge naturally as current flows, offering a paradigm shift from conventional algorithms. Using a multi-connected grid with georeferenced resistances, RGPPM estimates minimum and maximum paths for various starting points and multi-agent scenarios. We introduce five key performance indicators (KPIs)—Percentage of Distance Savings (PDS), Coefficient of Savings (CS), Coefficient of Global Savings (CGS), Percentage of Load Imbalance (PLI), and Percentage of Deviation with Multi-Agent (PDM)—to evaluate system performance. Simulations for textbook delivery to 129 schools in the Veracruz–Boca del Río area show that RGPPM significantly reduces travel distances. This leads to substantial savings in energy consumption, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and operating costs, particularly with electric vehicles. Finally, the results validate RGPPM as a flexible and scalable strategy for sustainable urban logistics. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18215625,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18215625,18,high

The model uses a multi-zone planning method and healthy-bus strategy to allocate Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs), Photovoltaic Distributed Generation (PVDG) units, and DSTATCOMs. The proposed framework optimally determines the numbers of EVCSs, PVDG units, and DSTATCOMs using Harris Hawk Optimization, considering the maximization of techno-economic benefits while satisfying all the security constraints. Further, to showcase the benefits from the perspective of EV owners, an EV waiting-time evaluation is performed. The simulation results show that integrating EVCSs (with both AC and DC chargers) with solar PVDG units and DSTATCOMs in the existing RDN improves the voltage profile, reduces power losses, and enhances cost-effectiveness compared to the system with only EVCSs. Furthermore, the zonal division ensures that charging infrastructure is distributed across the network increasing accessibility to the EV users. It is also observed that combining AC and DC chargers across the network provides overall benefits in terms of voltage profile, line loss, and waiting time as compared to a system with only AC or DC chargers.

maybe,,Optimized Defense Resource Allocation for Coupled Power-Transportation Networks Considering Information Security,"Electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are critical interfaces between urban mobility and distribution grids and are increasingly exposed to false data that can mislead operations and degrade voltage quality. This study proposes a defense-planning framework that models how cyber manipulation propagates to physical impacts in a coupled transport–power system. The interaction is modeled as a tri-level defender–attacker–operator problem in which a defender hardens a subset of charging stations, an attacker forges measurements and demand, and an operator redispatches resources to keep the system secure. We solve this problem with a method that embeds corrective operation into the evaluation and uses improved implicit enumeration (IIE) with pruning to identify a small set of high-value stations to protect with far fewer trials than an exhaustive search. On a benchmark feeder coupled to a road network, protecting a few traffic-critical stations restores compliance with voltage limits under tested attack levels while requiring roughly an order of magnitude fewer evaluations than complete enumeration. Sensitivity analysis shows that the loss of reactive power from PV inverters (PV VARs) harms voltage profiles more than an equivalent reduction in distributed storage, indicating that maintaining local reactive capability reduces the number of stations that must be hardened to meet a given voltage target. These results guide utilities and city planners to prioritize protection at traffic-critical EVCSs and co-plan local Volt/VAR capability, achieving code-compliant voltage quality under adversarial conditions with markedly lower planning effort. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18215855,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18215855,18,high

This study formulates the joint siting and sizing of EVCSs and distributed generators (DGs) as a constrained optimization that minimizes real and reactive losses and voltage deviation with integer bus location decisions. A novel version of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm known as GBest–Lévy Adaptive Differential ABC (GLAD-ABC) is introduced, combining global best guidance, differential perturbations, adaptive step sizes, Lévy-flight scouting, and periodic local refinement for finding the global optimum solution and avoiding local optima. The optimizer is coupled with a backward–forward sweep load flow and a EVCS power demand model. Validation on the IEEE-33 and IEEE-69 feeders across multiple scenarios shows that EVCS-only deployment degrades network performance, whereas optimizing EVCS and DG allocation via GLAD-ABC markedly improves voltage profiles and reduces both real and reactive losses.

To address these gaps, a simulation model was developed in Python 3.11.9, generating minute-by-minute power consumption profiles based on EVCS parameters, EV fleet characteristics, and charging behavior patterns. In contrast with state-of-the-art methods that often provide limited reference values or scenario-specific analyses, this study quantifies the influence of key factors and demonstrates that the average number of daily charging sessions, EVCS power rating, and the number of charging ports are the most significant determinants of DF.

maybe,,Chapter 5 - Hydrogen end-use and transportation,"In this chapter, several key sections including hydrogen (H2) utilization and applications are examined in detail. This chapter covers both mature and industrialized applications and fuel applications. Mature and industrialized applications are explored in oil refineries, the chemical sector, metallurgical processes, and other relevant fields (e.g., energy carriers, electricity generation, and effective energy-storing mediums). Fuel applications are investigated in relation to their roles in the aeronautics and space sectors, internal combustion engines, H2 fuel cell (FC) electric vehicles, and stand-alone power systems. In addition, various FC systems are reviewed, with challenges for safe and efficient use, operating conditions, and potential applications being identified and discussed. Then, the diverse methods and challenges of transporting H2 as a crucial element in the transition to cleaner energy sources are explored. Road transportation, utilizing tube trailers such as the TITAN, is optimal for shorter distances (distance of 160km) and limited demand scenarios. Liquid H2 delivery is considered economical for intermediate distances (over 300km) and high demands, although its viability for high-demand situations remains uncertain. Ocean transportation, despite its energy-intensive liquefaction process, has been explored, with various projects including the EQHHPP (Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Pilot Project) and WE-NET (World Energy Network) facing challenges due to impractical costs. However, renewed interest, particularly after events such as the Fukushima nuclear accident, has stimulated recent Japanese projects. H2 pipelines, with examples such as Air Liquide’s network, have seen significant development, primarily for local distribution and large-scale interregional energy transport. Fueling stations, crucial for the adoption of H2 vehicles, have proliferated globally, with off-site configurations being more prevalent due to different factors such as electricity tariffs and equipment limitations. Liquid H2 stations are preferred for safety reasons. Despite the promise of H2 as a clean energy carrier, transporting it presents challenges. Energy requirements for compression and liquefaction are significant, with material selection for pipelines crucial to prevent corrosion. Safety measures face obstacles due to H2 unique properties, including its low flammability limit. In conclusion, while H2 offers immense potential for a cleaner energy future, addressing the challenges of its transportation is essential for its widespread adoption.

maybe,,Evaluating the carbon-emission reduction potential of employing low-carbon demand response to guide electric-vehicle charging: A Chinese case study,"The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has resulted in considerable indirect carbon emissions from power systems. To reduce charging emissions, EVs should be charged strategically to consume generated renewable energy electricity. To achieve this goal, a low-carbon demand response model is proposed to stimulate multi-type EV users to consume more low-carbon electricity by guiding users to adjust their charging behaviour temporally and spatially. First, the charging flexibility of EVs is modelled considering different user behaviours and charging modes. To accurately guide the EV demand response, a method is proposed to calculate future carbon emission factors with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Considering the carbon emission factors, charging flexibility is integrated into a model for a low-carbon demand response. This model holistically optimizes fast and slow charging of EVs from the user’s perspective. Case studies are carried out using real-world data and future planning results for Changzhou and China. The results indicate that EVs produce 73 % less carbon emissions during driving than traditional gasoline vehicles. Using low-carbon demand response to guide EV charging could reduce carbon emissions by up to 15 % by 2035.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126196,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126196,18,high

This study tackles the critical challenge of aligning investment and planning between these systems, specifically considering the impact of EV charging behaviors. To address this issue, we propose a novel tri-level optimization framework that incorporates a quasi-variational inequality (QVI) model to effectively capture the interactions between user equilibrium (UE) in transportation networks and elastic EV charging demand. The upper level of the model optimizes investments in power systems, including distributed generation and charging infrastructure. The middle level concentrates on expanding road capacity, while the lower level resolves the traffic flow patterns under user equilibrium with elastic charging behaviors (UE-ECB) using the QVI approach. By transforming the tri-level model into a bi-level optimization program with quasi-variational inequality (OP-QVI) formulation, we achieve computational tractability and provide efficient solutions. Results show that the elastic charging demand model outperforms the non-elastic assumption, reducing total costs by 22.2 %, with power system investments down by 19.1 % and transportation system investments down by 39.8 %.

maybe,,Planning of a multi-agent mobile robot-based adaptive charging network for enhancing power system resilience under extreme conditions,"The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) poses escalating challenges to voltage stability in modern distribution systems, especially under extreme conditions (e.g., sudden load surges, generator failures, or network disruptions). Conventional fixed charging stations (FCS) lack flexibility, failing to adapt to the spatiotemporally dynamic and heterogeneous nature of EV charging demand, thereby exacerbating grid resilience risks. To address this, we propose a dual-mode multi-agent mobile robot-based adaptive charging network (MRACN) that enhances power system resilience through real-time, intelligent coordination of mobile charging resources. Our dynamic scheduling strategy enables MRACN units to switch seamlessly between cost-optimized dispatch during normal operations and resilience-driven prioritization during emergencies, guided by a real-time voltage stability index (VSI)-derived resilience coefficient. The framework combines a power-traffic co-simulation environment modelling urban congestion, heterogeneous EV mobility (private, taxi, fleet), and spatiotemporal demand variations, and a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model optimizing energy cost, customer satisfaction, and voltage stability under realistic constraints (traffic delays, mobility restrictions, grid safety margins). Simulations on a coupled IEEE 33-bus distribution system and 32-node transportation network demonstrate MRACN's superiority in enhancing voltage resilience, reducing operational costs, and improving EV service reliability across both normal and extreme grid scenarios.

maybe,,Online electric vehicle charging detection based on memory-based transformer using smart meter data,"The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) presents significant challenges for electricity grid management, particularly in accurately identifying EV charging patterns to optimize distribution network planning. Most recent works focus on EV load forecasting for future grid planning and do not take into account real-time EV charging identification. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised memory-based transformer (M-TR) model for real-time detection of EV charging events from streaming smart meter data. The proposed method is designed for deployment by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) and can be integrated into smart grid management systems to enhance grid stability and demand response strategies. The M-TR model leverages an encoder-decoder architecture: the encoder captures coarse-scale historical patterns over an extended temporal window, while the decoder focuses on fine-scale details within a local window. A key innovation of this approach is the dual memory comparison mechanism, which enables faster real-time inference by dynamically integrating historical and recent data. Unlike existing methods, the M-TR requires no prior knowledge of EV charging profiles and only uses real power consumption data from non-EV users. The goal of this approach is to automatically identify EV charging events from behind the meter aggregated smart meter data without requiring labeled EV data or additional sensors, thereby enabling real-time monitoring, reducing grid uncertainties, and supporting load balancing strategies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art unsupervised models, the M-TR achieves superior performance with an average F-score of 0.844 and an AUC of 0.910, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the model’s efficient execution time of 1.2 s per 1-min data sample highlights its suitability for real-time applications.

The rising penetration of EVs intensifies interdependencies between urban transport and electric power systems through charging infrastructures. This study presents a novel hybrid energy system that integrates renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic and wind turbines, conventional diesel generators, battery storage, and distribution grids to reliably satisfy the charging demands of electric vehicles in urban environments. A Hybrid Grey Wolf Cuckoo Search Algorithm (HGWCSA), which synergistically combines the exploitation capabilities of Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and the exploration strengths of Cuckoo Search (CS), is employed to optimize the system’s sizing and operational performance of the charging system.

maybe,,"Optimal allocation and configuration of renewable energy sources, electric vehicle parking lots, and fixed and mobile batteries under uncertainty and demand response program","The global transition to renewable energy sources (RESs) is critical for mitigating environmental pollution and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. However, the inherent intermittency of RESs presents significant challenges to power system stability, which are further exacerbated by the anticipated rise in electric vehicles (EVs), projected to exceed 130 million by 2030. To support this transformation, a robust energy infrastructure that integrates RESs, smart plug-in EV parking lots (PEV-PLs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and demand response programs (DRPs) is essential. This paper proposes a stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the optimal planning and operation of distribution systems (PDS) with increasing RES and EV penetration. The model incorporates wind and photovoltaic (PV) distributed generators (DGs), PEV-PLs, fixed and mobile battery energy storage systems (FBESSs and MBESSs), and DRPs. It optimally determines the sizing and placement of key components while strategically managing the relocation of MBESSs to minimize economic costs (investment, maintenance, and operation), environmental impacts (carbon emissions from the PDS), power losses, and voltage deviations. The model also accounts for major uncertainties, including EV charging behavior, wind speed, solar irradiation, load demand, and energy price fluctuations. The proposed framework is validated using the IEEE 69-bus test system, with nine configurations evaluated, ranging from a baseline (Case 1) to a fully integrated setup (Case 9). These cases include various combinations of RESs, PEV-PLs, FBESSs, MBESSs, and DRPs. The analysis underscores the importance of coordinated integration of RESs, storage, and DRPs to achieve environmental and operational benefits. Among the evaluated configurations, Case 7, which includes RESs, PEV-PLs, MBESSs, and DRP, emerges as the most balanced solution, achieving the lowest emission cost ($323,516.65/year), the highest loss reduction (39.60%), and the greatest voltage deviation improvement (41.14%). Case 3 excels in reducing operational costs (35.66%) and achieving the highest RES penetration (2.65 MVA), demonstrating the benefits of combining wind-PV DGs with a moderate EV fleet. In contrast, Case 9, despite incorporating the highest EV penetration (179 EVs) and the most comprehensive mix of technologies, underperforms economically due to system complexity, with only a 16.54% reduction in operational costs and a 1.23% increase in total cost. Overall, the results indicate that configurations that balance RES integration with moderate EV deployment and strategic energy storage, such as Cases 3 and 7, offer the most effective trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecmx.2025.101041,2025,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecmx.2025.101041,18,high

To reveal the long-term cost and environmental impacts of V2G, a novel power system planning model is established by co-optimizing the power system investment and operational decisions with V2G. Two V2G modes are discussed in this study: 1) the unidirectional V2G functions as a flexible load; and 2) the bidirectional V2G serves as an alternative energy storage option. The case study in China demonstrates that V2G can effectively mitigate the transition cost in the power system and bring about considerable environmental benefits. The transition cost of the power system will decrease by 2.0 % ∼ 3.8 % and the annualized carbon emissions will be reduced by 8.7–26.9 million tons due to V2G integrations during the period of 2021–2060. The cost and environmental impacts mainly arise from altering the generation and capacity mix of the power system. It is found that V2G can improve the utilization rate of existing units, thereby reducing the required capacity of coal-fired power units. Also, V2G can enhance the system flexibility which is most beneficial to solar power integration. To fully realize the intended benefits of V2G, policy guidance holds a pivotal role.

The building stock, including electric vehicles, can offer flexibility, but it is still unclear towards which objective the flexibility should be provided. Further, it is complicated for end-users to react to market prices. This paper investigates how buildings adapt their electricity use by following pre-defined tactics, known as heuristics, instead of market prices. Two heuristics are studied in two future scenarios compliant with European renovation policies. Based on the responses towards the heuristics, this study explores how flexibility from the Norwegian building stock impact electricity production and cross-border exchanges towards 2040. Results show that hourly electricity delivery to the building stock can be strongly modified, resulting in decreased peak electricity delivery by 10%–12% in 2040 when following the heuristics.

To enhance the electric vehicle charging capacity of community power grids, this paper proposes a two-tier capacity allocation strategy for community microgrids in the context of power systems. The upper-level model allocates capacity with the objectives of highest MG reliability, minimum comprehensive operating cost and minimum carbon emission, while the lower-level model optimizes the scheduling strategy with the objectives of minimum weighted operating cost and minimum charging cost for EV users. First, the real-time price is used to guide the residents’ electricity consumption behavior to be more adaptive to the uncertainty of renewable energy sources and to ensure that the community MG has sufficient resilient capacity. Second, based on the alternative storage effect of EVs, EVs are integrated with storage batteries and participate in ancillary services. The results indicate that adopting the charging and discharging strategy can reduce the comprehensive operating cost by ¥3,673.575 while improving reliability by 1.925%. Although the carbon trading market increases the overall operating cost, it results in an additional 131.5 kW of renewable energy capacity.

The increasing integration of renewable resources, such as solar and wind power, along with the rising adoption of EVs, underscores the need for robust strategies to optimize their incorporation into power systems. This study proposes a strategic, long-term planning optimization framework for the effective integration of green energy technologies. The framework emphasizes the optimal deployment of wind and photovoltaic (PV) distributed generators (DGs) for RESs and the establishment of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging infrastructure within distribution systems (DS). Furthermore, stationary battery energy storage systems (SBESSs) are integrated to enhance the penetration of RESs and EVs. The proposed framework determines optimal locations, sizes, and operational strategies for RESs, PEV infrastructure, and SBESSs while addressing technical, operational, and economic constraints. It accounts for uncertainties such as renewable generation variability, energy prices, electricity demand, and EV energy and time dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) and the backward reduction method (BRM) are employed to analyse various scenarios and ensure computational efficiency. Additionally, a coordinated charging and discharging control mechanism for SBESSs and EVs is developed to manage active and reactive power, thereby improving overall system performance. The framework simultaneously minimizes three objectives: long-term planning and operation cost, total power loss, and voltage deviation. Advanced optimization algorithms, including the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), are utilized to achieve these goals. The methodology is validated on a 69-bus system under four distinct configurations. Results indicate that the integration of wind, PV, PEV infrastructure, and SBESSs significantly enhances green energy penetration and system efficiency compared to other configurations. For instance, the integration of RESs and PEVs increases RES penetration from 3.35 MVA to 3.80 MVA with an optimal EV fleet size of 249 vehicles, achieving a 2.14 % reduction in total cost, albeit with a 6.33 % increase in power loss and a 2.03 % rise in voltage deviation compared to the RES-only scenario. The addition of SBESSs further improves RES penetration to 3.90 MVA, reduces costs by an additional 0.88 %, and mitigates power loss and voltage deviation by 13.36 % and 9.80 %, respectively, though it reduces the EV fleet size from 249 to 168 vehicles.

Key concerns include voltage deviations and increased active power losses due to the high penetration of EVCSs. This study proposes a comprehensive multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework for the optimal integration of EVCSs and shunt capacitors (SCs) within the DN, while simultaneously considering the dynamics of the transportation network (TN). To ensure an efficient and sustainable charging infrastructure, a Driving Range-based Traffic Flow Capturing (TFC) model is employed to optimize EV traffic flow coverage, accounting for EV battery constraints and strategic station placement. The proposed framework aims to minimize active power loss (APL) and voltage deviation (VD) in the DN while maximizing EV flow in the TN. To solve this complex multi-objective problem, a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (HGCO) is developed by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO). Objective function normalization is applied to balance the conflicting goals between the DN and TN. The proposed framework was tested on a 33-bus DN and a 25-node TN under three different planning approaches: one focusing on the DN, another on the TN, and a third on their integrated operation. In the integrated planning case, the system recorded an APL of 161.3842 kW and captured 39.45% of electric vehicle flow when battery constraints were applied. Upon removing these constraints, performance improved significantly, with the APL decreasing to 148.5903 kW and EV flow capture rising to 50.52%. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HGCO algorithm effectively balances power system reliability and transportation service efficiency.

To address these issues, it is essential to use advanced modeling techniques to represent uncertainties in generation, load, and pricing. This study introduces an enhanced optimization model that leverages the improved salp swarm algorithm (ISSA) for managing electric vehicle (EV) parking, taking into account price volatility within the main grid as part of a Demand Response Program (DRP). The approach incorporates load-shifting strategies to reduce daily operating costs by redistributing various load components between peak and off-peak periods. The ISSA demonstrates exceptional performance, noted for its rapid response times and strong capability to converge on the global optimum. While modeling hydrogen storage systems (HSS), however, several critical constraints are considered, including operational limits of the electrolyzer, the capacity of the fuel cell (FC), and the storage tank's restrictions. To validate the methodology, the model was applied to a test system comprising smart parking, renewable power plants, and thermal generation, all integrated into the proposed framework for addressing upstream grid price uncertainties.

Mitigating these impacts requires optimal planning that accounts for RES variability and additional EV charging demand. This paper presents a novel approach for the simultaneous optimal allocation and sizing of RES and EV charging stations, along with coordinated management of the charging process. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and supply costs, and EV battery costs. The model incorporates coefficients based on wind speed, solar radiation, and hourly peak demand to manage EV charging during off-peak hours.

The framework employs a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach to account for uncertainties in wildfire spread, transmission failures, and climate variability, ensuring robustness against worst-case scenarios. A GIS-driven wildfire risk assessment is incorporated to prioritize infrastructure reinforcements, microgrid deployment, and renewable integration in high-risk regions.

The existing literature has examined the impact of extreme events on power system planning. However, few studies have systematically explored the role of large-scale electric vehicle (EV) fleets toward grid resilience enhancement in EWEs. Therefore, we propose a resilience-oriented power system planning method considering vehicle-to-grid (V2G) coordination, especially amidst blizzard events. A blizzard-induced grid failure model is established for long-term N-K contingency scenario generation, followed by a two-stage generation expansion and line hardening optimization considering both normal and contingency conditions. Three charging modes of EV fleets, i.e., plug and play (PnP), orderly charging (V1G) and V2G, are compared. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, using 2024 data from the Jibei region of northern China and two extreme blizzard scenarios, demonstrate that combining resilience-oriented planning with V2G coordination significantly reduces total system costs by 58.02% compared to the baseline, achieving the lowest total cost of $2.48×103 million.

Several parameters are taken into account as part of this process, such as proximity to load centers, capacity of the power system, and traffic volume. The common charging station location distant from the load centers has been established to enhance the quality of power and reduce 5–10 % of distribution losses. Additionally, site location should also include the area land cost and this cost in the urban area is estimated to be about $500 to $2000 per square meter and other zoning regulations. In the design, the service radius of charging stations is also an important factor; Keeping the battery's DOD between 50 % and 70 % yields an estimated driving range of 150–200 km, which suggests a distance between stations of 50–70 km. In this case, the discount rate of 5 % can be adopted for O&M costs over the planning horizon of 20 years while the capital costs of provision of each station varies from $ 50,000 to $ 200,000 depending on the size of the station.

In this context, this work endeavors to develop a methodology for estimating the impact of V2G technology, considering both the deployment and utilization of EVs in a Brazilian case study. Applying traditional methodologies that do not consider operational system models can lead to potential future load shedding. It may accentuate disparities between long-term and short-term outcomes, especially with EV and V2G integration.

In this regard, electric vehicles (EVs) are a viable transportation option that benefit the environment in reducing GHG emissions. Although the installation of rapid charging stations (RCSs) helps to promote EVs, installing these at improper locations in the distribution network worsens the voltage profile, increases power loss, and energy loss while travelling from EV's current location to RCS. Furthermore, RCS installation cost and waiting time at RCS need to be considered. Therefore, a two-stage optimal planning is proposed in this article to address the issues stated above. In the first stage, simultaneous optimal planning of RCS and distributed generators is done to minimize active power loss, voltage deviation, EV user cost and to maximize voltage stability index. In the second stage, optimal number of connectors are decided to minimize the installation cost and waiting time in queue at RCS.

maybe,,Probabilistic load flow analysis for evaluation of photovoltaic grid connection applications; Probabilistische Lastflussanalyse zur Bewertung der Netzanschlussanträge von Photovoltaikanlagen,"Uncertainty in power system analysis is increasing, mainly due to decentralized generation and the related spatial distribution of power plants, as well as the inherent volatility of renewable energy sources. In Austria, this development is reflected in a high number of photovoltaic grid connection applications in recent years. On the consumption side, there are changes in grid loads due to the increasing electrification of society, which is reflected, for example, in a rising number of electric vehicles. These aspects of uncertainty in generation and consumption must be considered in the planning process of distribution grids. A proper way to include uncertainty in the hosting capacity analysis of power grids are probabilistic load flow calculation methods. This paper provides an introductory overview of probabilistic load flow analysis, available calculation methods, required input parameters and the interpretation of results. This paper focuses on photovoltaics, so a correlation analysis of historical power generation measurements of spatially distributed photovoltaic power plants in Austria is presented.

maybe,,Risk-based joint flexible distribution network expansion planning and allocation of EV parking lots,"The main goal of the proposed dynamic distribution network expansion planning (DEP) is to eco-reliably supply the incremental annual demand by providing an optimal schedule to site and size of either pre-existing equipment or installing new ones. Also, it determines how to well-operate the expanded network. HV substation allocation, feeder routing, and conductor sizing besides executing such flexibility-oriented upgrades as designing of distribution network (DN) as a meshed topology by allocating switching devices to form reconfigurable DN, utilizing distributed generations (DGs) and parking-lots are the options are considered in this paper. It must be mentioned that, the peak load rarely happens in a year, but it’s commonly considered as the base of traditional DEP, which leads to a situation which balancing the load and generation would be difficult and so costly. So, in the proposed methodology, by enabling the optimal schedule of the transferable loads, smoothing of the load profile and finally better managing the uncertainties and variability of supply and demand across all relevant timescales is reached. As known, in the expansion planning process, the accepted level of risk by distribution companies is an important factor when decision-making. To model this issue, information gap decision theory (IGDT) is used in the present work. To analyze the efficiency of the designed expansion method, it has applied on a 54-bus distribution network and then results are analyzed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.",10.1007/s12667-022-00552-1,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s12667-022-00552-1,17,high
maybe,,Frequency reserves and inertia in the transition to future electricity systems,"The transition towards an electricity system that is dominated by asynchronous and non-dispatchable generators, such as wind and solar power, entails challenges related to balancing the load and, thereby, keeping the grid frequency stable. Many technologies can contribute to load balancing and frequency control. This study investigates the interactions between electricity generation and frequency control in terms of investments and operation, using cost-minimizing, linear optimization modeling. The model is applied in three different geographic cases and for four future time-points, starting off with the already existing transmission and generation capacities, so as to yield insights into different systems and different stages along the energy transition. The results show that frequency control constraints in the optimization model have a weak impact on the system composition and cost, and that batteries are important for minimizing the impact. Furthermore, inertia requirements without a reserve demand show no impact on the cost or system composition. When allowing for vehicle-to-grid from battery electric vehicles, a large proportion of stationary grid battery investments is displaced, and the impact on system cost from adding frequency control constraints is removed. © The Author(s) 2023. corrected publication 2024.",10.1007/s12667-023-00568-1,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s12667-023-00568-1,17,high

EVs as a random load may take a toll on the stability and reliability of the power system. However, they can also help to improve the grid performance if operated in coordination with the load profile. In this paper, the impact of EV fleet integration in the unbalanced distribution network has been observed. A probabilistic EV model for charging and discharging of EVs is proposed, in which both the arrival and departure time of EVs is modelled as a normal distribution and the distance travelled is modelled as a lognormal distribution taking into account the spatial temporal features of EV charging. The charging-discharging schedule of EVs is optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the aim of obtaining a flattened load profile. The developed algorithm was tested on IEEE 13-bus unbalanced test distribution network, and the results show that the optimized EV integration has resulted in flattening the load profile (gap between maximum and minimum demand reduced to ~ 18 kW), improvement in the voltage profile and reduction in the network unbalance as depicted by the decrease in the maximum neutral current drawn (~ 28%). The proposed model can be implemented for practical distribution system planning and can be an effective tool in balancing the unbalanced network in the era of rapidly increasing EVs in the real-time distribution system. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",10.1007/s40866-024-00220-6,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s40866-024-00220-6,17,high

The proposed model is a bi-level optimization model formulated as an upper and lower-level problem. The problem of unit commitment in the transmission network as the upper level problem with the aim of reducing operating costs and load shedding as a mixed integer linear programming model and the problem of optimal operation in the distribution network by considering renewable and non-renewable resources along with electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS), it has been considered as a linear model with the aim of reducing the cost of purchasing power from the transmission network and increasing the use of renewable energy and charging power of EVCS. According to the literature, the study gap can be seen in three key points; firstly, it is of great importance to provide a convex model that can guarantee global optimal solutions. The next point is related to the problem-solving time, according to the dimensions and number of variables and parameters in the problem of optimal coordination of the transmission and distribution network, providing a method to achieve global optimal solutions in the shortest time and the last point is related to the modeling of any number of distribution networks is integrated with the transmission network. To solve the proposed bi-level optimization problem, the method of rewriting the optimization problems using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition equations, which can model global optimal solutions as well as fast solution time and modeling a large number of distribution networks in the transmission network has been proposed. Several different networks have been considered for the validation of the proposed model and method, which proves the results obtained from the simulation of the efficiency of the proposed model and method in considering the coordinated operation of transmission and smart distribution networks.

Relying on day-ahead power market planning has limitations in addressing the volatility caused by RESs, resulting in unnecessary reserve capacity consumption. The optimal utilization of flexible resources, including Energy Storage Systems (ESSs), is crucial to tackle these issues. Economic Dispatch (ED) plays a vital role in power system operation and planning, which has become even more significant with the growth of RESs and the widespread adoption of EVs. It introduces dynamic loads due to varying user behaviors, posing operational challenges for the power system.

maybe,,A data-aided robust approach for bottleneck identification in power transmission grids for achieving transportation electrification ambition: a case study in New York state,"As the enthusiasm for electric vehicles passes the range anxiety and other tests, large-scale transportation electrification becomes a prominent topic in research and policy discussions. In consequence, the public attention has shifted upstream and holistically towards the integration of large-scale transportation electrification to power systems. This paper proposes a method to identify bottlenecks in power transmission systems to accommodate large-scale and stochastic electric vehicles charging demands. First, a distributionally robust chance-constrained direct current optimal power flow model is developed to quantify the impacts of stochastic electric vehicles charging demands. Subsequently, an agent-based model with the trip-chain method is applied to obtain the spatiotemporal distributions of electric vehicles charging demands for both light-duty electric vehicles and medium and heavy-duty electric vehicles. The first two moments of those distributions are extracted to build an ambiguity set of electric vehicles charging demands. Finally, a 121-bus synthetic transmission network for New York State power systems is used to validate the future transportation electrification in New York State from 2025 to 2035. Results show that the large-scale transportation electrification in New York State will account for approximately 13.33 % to 16.79 % of the total load demand by 2035. The transmission capacity is the major bottleneck in supporting New York State to achieve its transportation electrification. To resolve the bottlenecks, we explore some possible solutions, such as transmission capacity expansion and distributed energy resources investment. Wind power shows an advantage over solar energy in terms of total operational costs due to better peak alignment between wind power and electric vehicles charging demand. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.adapen.2024.100173,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.adapen.2024.100173,17,high
maybe,,Power system operational impacts of electric vehicle dynamic wireless charging,"The electrification of the transportation sector poses an opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from passenger vehicles. Electric vehicle (EV) charging through dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), known as roadway electrification, could shift EV demand profiles to better coincide with renewable electricity generation. However, this would be a very large new load and few studies evaluate the regional impacts of DWPT charging in a power transmission system. This paper defines methods that address dataset generation for passenger vehicle trips and models to evaluate regional impacts for this emerging technology. Household vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data form localized EV demand profiles through discrete-event simulation. This data serves as exogenous inputs for a Production Cost Model (PCM) of a synthetic transmission system based on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas's (ERCOT) network. EV charging methods are compared for both a 2018 baseline generation mixture and a high-renewable generation case incorporating 20 GW of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. The PCM employs unit commitment and economic dispatch (UC&ED) models to compare financial, environmental, and grid reliability impacts from EV charging across passenger EV adoption levels. In-transit charging could reduce grid operational costs by as much as 1.49%, with up to $13.7B saved in annual vehicle operational costs for consumers compared to gas-powered vehicles. Health impacts analysis from power plant and vehicle tailpipe emissions from this study show net health benefits increase by 40% for in-transit charging coupled with high renewable generation. Renewable resources provide an avenue for cost-effective in-transit charging with reduced emissions.

This paper addresses these complex challenges by proposing an Optimal Feeder Routing and Battery Storage System (OFRBSS) model. The model offers a single-stage, long-term optimization framework that simplifies load uncertainty to two values – minimum and maximum power demand – thereby enhancing simplicity and efficiency in modelling power demand uncertainty. Leveraging the Column and Constraint Generation algorithm, the OFRBSS model optimizes feeder routing and battery storage system installation, enabling distribution system operators to meet operational constraints under worst power demand conditions.

maybe,,Optimal sitting and sizing of hydrogen refilling stations in distribution networks under locational marginal prices,"The decarbonization of the mobility sector motivates to increase the penetration of battery and fuel-cell electric vehicles. The proliferation of these mobility modes will be accompanied by the massive installation of charging and refilling infrastructures into existing networks. This work focuses on fuel-cell vehicles, for which refilling points are needed. Difficulties in hydrogen transportation can be circumvented by deploying onsite hydrogen generation assets (electrolysers) and storage, which can be partially or fully supplied through local renewable generators. Nevertheless, such assets require a considerable initial investment, being necessary the use of planning tools in order to maximize revenues for private investors. This paper focuses on this issue. In particular, an optimal sitting and sizing tool for hydrogen refilling stations with onsite storage and electrolysers is developed. The developed methodology considers the influence of locational marginal prices, which are cleared by the distribution system operator in order to translate the real electricity cost per node. This pricing strategy helps to best allocate assets through the network and thus resulting valuable for planners in order to site refilling infrastructures properly. An original multi-year iterative algorithm based on the multi-cut Benders' decomposition is proposed in order to alleviate the intrinsic high computational cost of the planning tool while accommodate long-term inflation and degradation rates of parameters. A number of simulations are performed on the well-known IEEE 33-bus system. Results verify that locational marginal pricing effectively translates the nodal electricity cost to end-users. Remark, the total electrolysis capacity turns out to be the most significant parameter, reducing further the cost of the project, while storage capacity has a limited influence. Results highlight the importance of the infrastructure capacity when determining the placement and sizing of electrolysers, thus supporting decisions when upgrading existing infrastructure. The impact of the number of stations to be installed and the budget cap is also analysed, showing that both parameters have similar influence and may reduce the total project cost by 70% approximately. The typical scheduling behaviour of the electrolysis-storage facilities is discussed, showing how storage is capable to provide energy arbitrage exploiting locational marginal prices. Finally, the computational performance of the developed algorithm is assessed, verifying that the new tool is efficient and portable. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124075,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124075,17,high

Simultaneously, the Distribution Network (DN) encounters escalating challenges in meeting charging demand during peak traffic periods. Consequently, there is a mounting demand for the deployment of innovative Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies to augment the DN's flexibility in power dispatch and alleviate travel costs for EV users. Hence, this paper proposes an EV-user-equilibrium-(UE)-constrained V2G planning framework that enhances flexibility in the DN. The framework aims to ascertain the optimal placement and capacity of EV charging stations (EVCSs) and V2G charging piles within the Transportation Network (TN). It takes into account the equilibrium condition stemming from competitive EV charging and routing behaviors alongside the optimal expansion of DN energy resources to accommodate the electricity supplied by the V2G piles. This study commences by analyzing EV drivers’ travel decisions, considering the influence of charging and V2G pile locations and sizes. Subsequently, we tackle the Traffic Assignment Problem with User Equilibrium (TAP-UE) model to characterize the steady-state traffic flow distribution of EVs. Following this, we formulate the optimization model for the Coordinated Power and Transportation Network (CPTN), which encompasses the optimal expansion of DN facilities and traffic flow regulation under UE conditions. To mitigate the computational complexity associated with the V2G planning model, we introduce a series of linearization methods to obtain a manageable Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solution.

Building fuel-electric mixed fleets based on three-level network for location-routing planning is an emerging scheme to optimize the “last mile” of rural logistics. To compensate for the shortcomings of electric vehicles in terms of driving range and carrying capacity, distribution center infrastructure should be coordinately sited and constructed in the regional networks.

maybe,,Multi-objectives transmission expansion planning considering energy storage systems and high penetration of renewables and electric vehicles under uncertain conditions,"Transmission expansion planning (TEP) integrating electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) is pivotal for the transition toward cleaner and more sustainable energy systems. One of the biggest challenges in TEP with EVs and RESs is the uncertainty inherent in their behaviors. Managing this uncertainty is critical for ensuring the grid's reliability and resilience, and for facilitating a seamless transition to EVs. A potent method for addressing uncertainties in power systems is the application of a scenario-based approach. However, the efficiency of this approach is contingent upon an increase in the number of representative scenarios, which, in turn, escalates computational time, making solving the TEP problem a crucial task. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-objective resilience model for TEP, to advance towards more sustainable energy systems. The model seeks to strike a balance between economic, environmental, and technical considerations by minimizing planning costs, carbon dioxide emissions, and enhancing the voltage profile. Furthermore, the paper proposes a cascaded intelligent strategy to handle uncertainties and reduce computational complexity by reducing the number of representative scenarios without compromising system reliability. The adaptive neuro-inference system is designed to manage long-term uncertainties, while two fuzzy systems are developed to address short-term uncertainties. The problem is formulated as a complex non-linear multi-objective optimization problem. To address this, a hybrid approach combining the mountain gazelle optimizer and the multi-objective salp swarm optimizer is developed to solve the problem.

This paper proposes a novel approach that combines different energy models to plan the infrastructure for supplying the energy demand of new, decarbonized, and highly electrified urban districts on a real-world scale. First, a model for energy management in buildings is used to plan and operate equipment for heating, cooling, and solar photovoltaic distributed generation. Second, a model that plans electric vehicle charging infrastructure determines the number and types of charging stations. Then, a large-scale distribution network planning model designs a cost-efficient electricity distribution grid to supply the district. A case study is presented for a new urban district in Madrid, Spain, to demonstrate how this approach can be applied to energy infrastructure planning in a real-world context. This case study presents different scenarios of energy efficiency performances in buildings and penetration levels of solar installations, electric vehicles, and heating and cooling systems. The results show that even in a high electrification scenario, improving energy efficiency in buildings through a district heating network based on heat pumps can lead to a lower peak electricity demand. This peak load reduction allows for integrating more electric vehicles, avoiding further investments in the electricity distribution network.

maybe,,Impact of 100% vehicle electrification on the distribution grid in dense urban regions,"Vehicle electrification is a requisite for cities to combat global warming. A key challenge associated with the wide-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is the impact of charging on distribution networks. The problem is further exacerbated in dense urban regions, where space is intrinsically limited. If the grid infrastructure is too constrained, it will dictate locations where EV chargers can be deployed without the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. In dense urban regions, this may hinder or slow down adoption. This paper investigates the impact of EV charging on the distribution grid in dense urban regions, with a focus on a case study based in Harlem, a neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City (NYC). The impact of EV charging on the distribution grid depends on several factors, including the number of charging stations, their locations, and the charging demand they result in, which also relate to consumers’ charging behavior. To evaluate this impact, load flow analysis was carried out for a futuristic scenario assuming all personal cars become EVs, with a focus on voltage drop and transformer/feeder overloading. It was found that with proper siting of chargers and scheduling for charging the distribution grid can handle a 100% EV scenario without infrastructure upgrade. © 2024",10.1016/j.egyr.2024.05.030,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2024.05.030,17,high
maybe,,Collaborative planning of electric vehicle integrated charging and swapping stations and distribution network for carbon emission reduction,"Electric vehicle (EV) integration into the distribution network (DN) is a significant measure for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, yet existing studies have not fully explored the carbon reduction potential of the EV. This article proposes an innovative collaborative planning framework for electric vehicle integrated charging and swapping stations (EVICSS) and DN for carbon emission reduction. Initially, the division of responsibilities and mechanism analysis for emission reduction in DN are presented. Subsequently, the ladder carbon price model is presented to incentivize carbon mitigation efforts. And, considering the architecture and functioning mode of the EVICSS, the operational model for EVICSS equipment is established to deliver high-quality services to EV users, taking into account fast charging stations (FCS), fast battery swapping stations (FBSS), and cascade energy storage system (CESS) comprehensively. Taking into account the economic implications of carbon trading, a collaborative planning strategy for EVICSS and the DN is formulated to minimize overall costs while maximizing carbon emission reductions. Then an modified integrated gravitational search algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm (MIGSA-PSOA) is customizedly developed to solve this complicated optimization problem. Finally, case studies based a real DN are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the collaborative planning model. The results demonstrated it can effectively respond to DN power regulation and realize carbon emission reduction. Compared with independent planning, collaborative planning can increase the planning cost and total cost to 15.6 % and 33.1 % respectively. © 2024",10.1016/j.egyr.2024.11.051,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2024.11.051,17,high

The proposed method comprises different steps. First, the energy system is analyzed using the Smart Energy Systems concept to identify high renewable energy scenarios. Then, the power system is evaluated to ensure compliance with security and stability requirements. The method innovatively combines an overall energy system analysis, from an energy planning perspective, with more detailed power system analyses, where the power balance at each instant is the main item of interest rather than the energy balance. The study, applied to Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain), demonstrates that 100% electrification of passenger cars with renewable energy sources is the optimal scenario, resulting in reductions of 45.86% and 45.1% in oil consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, respectively, compared to the reference scenario. In addition, in these optimal conditions, there would be a 29.9% reduction in the total annual costs of the energy system and a 13.81% reduction in the total energy required to supply it.

Could Na–S batteries be a suitable alternative for ESS applications if the toxicity problem can be solved? This article performs the optimal sizing and feasibility analysis of an electric vehicle charging station with a minimum cost objective under daily, hourly, and hybrid demand variability with multi-year sensitivity analyses for both ESS technologies. Moreover, the scope is deepened with sensitivity analyses based on solar horizontal irradiation, wind speed, and electricity selling prices. Due to the HPS connection to the distribution busbar, power quality issues are included in the cost-based optimization framework, and the effects of power quality issues on the sizing and feasibility outputs are compared at higher demand variability. The results show that using SLB at wind speeds lower than 4.7 m/s and irradiances lower than 3 kWh/m2/day or above 0.035 $/kWh electric sale price is not economical.

maybe,,Electric vehicle aggregator as demand dispatch resources: Exploring the impact of real-time market performance on day-ahead market,"As the integration of variable renewable energy sources (VREs) into power grids escalates, effectively managing the unpredictability of VRE generation becomes crucial. Electric vehicles, utilized as distributed energy storage, emerge as a potential solution. However, it remains unclear whether electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs), acting as demand dispatch resources, have a favorable impact on the overall electricity market, especially when considering their performance in real-time markets during day-ahead energy allocations. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized clearing mechanism (DCM) relying on an multi-attribute evaluation model of EVAs for optimal bidding strategies in the day-ahead market. The EVAs multi-attribute evaluation model employs an integration of the Entropy-Analytic Hierarchy Process, allowing for the simultaneous consideration of real-time performance and day-ahead bidding prices of EVAs. Consequently, the decentralized clearing mechanism supports strategic electricity planning in the day-ahead market by incorporating the actual market performance of EVAs. Furthermore, a real-time market bidding model is developed to balance dynamic mismatches between VRE generation and demand, aiming to maximize profits through optimized real-time commitment and real-time dispatch. System simulations on the IEEE39 bus system demonstrate that the DCM enhances overall profits by 18.69% compared to the centralized clearing mechanism. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2024.132824,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2024.132824,17,high

A potential solution is using renewable energy microgrids, which reduce dependence on the power grid. On the other hand, Electric vehicles are a solution to combat environmental pollution as they emit no harmful pollutants compared to conventional vehicles. However, charging these vehicles can lead to congestion, reliability, and resiliency issues for power systems. To address this issue, renewable energy sources are being utilized to ease the burden of electric vehicles on power grids. Therefore, this paper assumes a proposed microgrid's planning and management in Kermanshah city and uses unique renewable energy sources such as the INVELOX wind turbine and common photovoltaic panels by utilizing Homer software. Results show that for the first scenario, excluding PV panels, the NPC is $432,173. Adding PV panels reduces the optimized NPC by 53 % to $282,523.

EH outputs, addressing electricity and heat needs, are managed via battery storage systems (BSS) and electric vehicle (EV) fleets in regulation markets. The energy hub operator optimizes decisions concerning natural gas and energy, minimizing costs in electricity supply and thermal energy carriers across day-ahead (DA) markets and regulations.

maybe,,Vehicle-to-grid as a competitive alternative to energy storage in a renewable-dominant power system: An integrated approach considering both electric vehicle drivers' willingness and effectiveness,"Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which enables bidirectional power flow between electric vehicles (EVs) and power grids, is a possible solution for integrating EVs and renewable energy (RE) into the power system. While EV drivers are indispensable components for the V2G applications, the extant power system studies have underexamined the willingness of EV drivers to participate in V2G. In addition, few studies investigate whether the small-scale and time-varying V2G supply can replace utility-level energy storage. Given this background, this study combined discrete choice experiments with energy storage capacity expansion planning (ES-CEP) to simulate time-varying V2G participation and effectiveness. The choice experiments identified drivers’ preferences for V2G, which was used to simulate V2G participation under different compensation schemes. Time-varying V2G participation was integrated into ES-CEP for renewable-dominant power system to assess the potential of V2G to replace ES at the utility scale. The results showed that most drivers were unlikely to engage in V2G, although this reluctance decreased during the night. Higher guaranteed state-of-charge, accessible V2G facilities, and monetary enrollment compensation encouraged the participation. The ES-CEP results showed that, even with a limited V2G (4.5–15.3 % of EV drivers), V2G significantly reduced the optimal ES capacity (36.5–45.6 % for power and 39.6–60.6 % for energy), shaved peak netload by 18.5 %, and saved the total cost by 3.35 %, even after accounting for V2G enrollment compensation and battery degradation. EVs that charged during the daytime and participated in V2G at night were the most utilized, resulting in 0.92 % of annual battery aging, but generated a profit of 636,749 KRW (553 USD). The findings of this study underscore the importance of a suitable compensation scheme for V2G and supplementary measures for incentivizing EV charging during off-peak hours, as these elements are essential for the successful implementation of V2G. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2024.133194,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2024.133194,17,high

The development of EV technology requires charging infrastructure, which must be considered in the Distribution System Expansion Planning (DSEP). Due to the presence of EV and the load they impose on the distribution system, the planning of EV charging stations is done simultaneously with the DSEP so that the system operator can properly consider the technical constraints of the network and operational constraints. This paper presents a bi-level model for EV charging station expansion planning. The main purpose of the first level problem is expansion planning of charging stations and distribution system. But the charging stations are mostly built by a merchant investor, and they do so when it is profitable and has a reasonable risk. Therefore, the merchant investor should be encouraged to build a charging station in the planned areas. For this reason, in the second level problem, the profitability of the charging station and its risk are examined. To solve this problem, genetic algorithm (GA) has been used.

maybe,,Risk-constrained community battery utilisation optimisation for electric vehicle charging with photovoltaic resources,"High penetration of renewable energy generation in the electricity grid presents power system operators with challenges, including voltage instability, mainly due to fluctuating power generation. To address the challenges that arise from intermittent renewable generation, we explore the introduction of community batteries to provide an elegant solution for storing excess generation of renewable energy resources (RESs) and reverting to the grid in peak demand periods. In particular, determining the optimal battery type and size along with the minimum costs is challenging. Moreover, the growth in adapting electrical vehicles (EVs) imposes additional demand-related challenges on the power system, compared to the traditional industrial and household demands. This paper introduces a long-term planning strategy for community batteries to capture the surplus generation of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panels in a given area, and direct the stored energy to charge EVs, without injecting to the upstream grid. For long-term investment planning on batteries, we consider 15 years’ worth of historical data associated with solar irradiance, temperature, EV demands, and household demands. A novel stochastic mathematical model is proposed for decision-making on battery specifications (the type and capacity of the batteries needed per year) based on the four standard battery types (based on capacity) provided by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. Uncertainties related to the EVs and RESs are captured by a non-parametric robust technique, namely the information gap decision theory, from optimistic and pessimistic perspectives. The investment decision determining component is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, incorporating the GUROBI optimisation tool, that provides a feasible global solution with a low computational burden. Our proposed solution not only determines the optimal battery installation strategies to improve the stability profile of the grid by capturing the excess power of PV generation but also facilitates EV integration in the community towards reaching the net-zero emissions target. For example, our analysis indicates that the community batteries bring significant cost advantage, in excess of $6 million, by installing type 4 batteries (4-hour capacity batteries) with over 6000 capacity, in a community inside a PV-rich residential area considered for the analysis, in comparison to scenarios without the community battery inclusion. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.est.2024.112646,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2024.112646,17,high

The volatility of renewable energy units and the uncertainty of EVs have produced non-negligible impacts on the operating stability of power systems. To achieve low-carbon and long-term stable in power systems, it is necessary to conduct effective planning for the synergistic development of renewable energy units and EVs. To investigates the interactive mechanism when concerning vehicle to grid (V2G) and energy storage charging pile in the system, a collaborative optimization model considering the complementarity of vehicle-storage charging pile is proposed. Four scenarios with different V2G proportions are compared with each other to verify the effectiveness of the model. Results show that during the planning period, the installation number of energy storage charging piles will significantly increase when V2G proportions expands. The total costs consistently show a descending trend if EVs participating more in V2G. When the V2G proportions increase from 25 % to 100 %, the total CO<inf>2</inf> emissions decrease by 4.49 %. In addition, the improvement of V2G proportions plays a vital role in peaking regulation.

maybe,,Long-term optimal planning for renewable based distributed generators and plug-in electric vehicles parking lots toward higher penetration of green energy technology,"Due to the extensive pollution generated by conventional fuel-based power systems, there has been a significant shift in global focus toward increasing the adoption of renewable energy sources (RESs) through renewable-based distributed generation (DG), particularly wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Additionally, the electrification of the automotive sector, aimed at reducing pollution, is driving a rapid increase in electric vehicles (EVs). A critical element of this transition is the development of efficient infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicle parking lots (PEV-PLs). A collaborative planning model is essential to address the impact of integrating RESs and PEV-PLs into the electric power distribution system (DS) over the long term. This paper introduces a long-term mixed-integer non-linear (MINL) optimization planning model designed to optimize the planning and operation of RESs, including wind and PV sources, alongside PEV-PLs infrastructure. The goal is to increase the penetration of renewable energy and EVs within the DS while adhering to security constraints. The optimization model features three non-linear, incompatible objective functions: minimizing overall strategic expected investment, maintenance, emission, and operational costs; long-term power loss; and voltage deviation. Moreover, to ensure realism, the model incorporates uncertainties related to stochastic variables such as the intermittent nature of RESs, EV energy and time variables, loads, and energy price fluctuations, using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and the backward reduction method (BRM). A hybrid optimization algorithm addresses the proposed objectives, combining the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) to minimize the three distinct objective functions concurrently. The effectiveness of the planning model is validated using the 69-bus benchmark test system, with four configurations tested: case 1 (the base case), case 2 (the base case with RESs (wind and PV)), case 3 (the base case with RESs and PEV-PLs), and case 4 (the base case with RESs, PEV-PLs, and a higher number of EVs). The impact of RESs on DS operation, PEV-PLs on RES penetration levels and DS operation, and the effect of increased EV penetration on the integrated capacity of RESs and DS operation are thoroughly investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal integration of 5 PEV-PLs, accommodating a fleet of 107 PEVs with wind and PV DGs, increases the RES penetration level from 3.35 MVA to 3.85 MVA compared to the case with RESs alone. Moreover, integrating PEV-PLs with RESs results in a 51.00 % reduction in overall operational costs, a 37.55 % reduction in overall planning and operation costs, a 52.82 % reduction in total carbon emissions, and a 45.85 % reduction in total voltage deviation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.est.2024.114057,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2024.114057,17,high

maybe,,Enabling mass integration of electric vehicles through distributed energy resource management systems,"Global initiatives are actively progressing to integrate large numbers of electric vehicles (EVs) as part of efforts to electrify and decarbonize the transportation sector. This approach plays a crucial role in addressing global greenhouse emissions and pollution problems. However, mass integration of EVs imposes unprecedented challenges to electrical power systems, especially to their distribution grids. These challenges range from planning issues, where the traditional panning procedures are not adequate for integration of EVs and their charging stations, to operational challenges, where a huge number of dispersed EVs can cause peak load increase, voltage violations, congestions, feeder overloads, etc. Hence, despite the significant importance of maximizing the deployment of EVs, their stochastic integration can give rise to critical challenges in electric power systems, thereby impeding their subsequent expansion. Therefore, in order to properly integrate mass amounts of EVs, without causing technical violations in the electrical power system, intelligent software tools are required, to aid distribution system operators and engineers in the transition to a new era of electrified transportation. In this paper, we argue that novel software solutions called Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMSs) are a key solution for enabling a safe integration of mass amounts of EVs into emerging distribution grids. Specifically, we introduce a novel Hybrid DERMS framework, as an integration of multiple hierarchical levels of DER management solutions, and propose this solution as a suitable instrument for distribution system operators and grid engineers to safely integrate and manage high volumes of EVs within the grid infrastructure. The hypothesis is validated through a real-life use case for integration and management of high amounts of EVs into an existing distribution grid, using an industrial DERMS solution. Specifically, an in-depth analysis of adding two large charging stations, boasting capacities of 5 MW each, has been performed through all stages of integration, from the planning stage, up to using their flexible output to manage technical constraint violations in real time. The influence of these EV charging stations on both the feeder where they are planned to be integrated, as well as on the entire supply substation, have been analyzed in detail. The resultant findings, especially on successfully managing overloads, peak load increases, as well as voltage violations through intelligent use of aggregated EVs through DERMS, have proven to be notably encouraging, further substantiating the paper's hypothesis. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.ijepes.2024.109798,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2024.109798,17,high
maybe,,Optimal hierarchical modeling of power to X stations through a chance constrained Two-Stage stochastic programming,"The carbon neutrality policy aiming for net zero carbon emissions has led to a significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources (RES) globally. However, due to their uncertain nature, RES can cause imbalances in power demand. Recently, Power-to-X (P2X) station technology has gained attention as a solution to the uncertainties of RES and as a means to enhance the capacity and efficiency of RES operations. P2X stations can be utilized when power demand imbalances occur due to the uncertain output of RES or when the power system cannot accommodate the power supply from RES due to various stability issues. Specifically, when supply disruptions occur in the power system due to RES uncertainties, P2X stations contribute to preventing RES curtailment by supplying power to electric vehicle (EV) fuel sources, producing heat using electric heat pumps (EHP), or producing hydrogen using electrolyzers (ELZ), thus improving the uncertain financial benefits for independent power producers (IPP). This paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based chance-constrained two-stage stochastic optimization (CCTS) approach to address imbalances in power demand from RES and to enhance the profitability of IPP by finding the optimal planning and operational solutions for P2X stations. The proposed method provides hierarchical level results, demonstrating that economic benefits can increase by up to 60.2% with the application of P2X stations and that curtailed energy from RES can be reduced by up to 76.5%. The proposed methodology is also validated for its superior performance by being compared with both the non-linear stochastic chance constraint method and the stochastic method. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.ijepes.2024.110169,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2024.110169,17,high
maybe,,Security constrained unit commitment in smart energy systems: A flexibility-driven approach considering false data injection attacks in electric vehicle parking lots,"In this paper, a new structure, the so-called FBSCUC<inf>FDI</inf>P-P/EV is proposed as flexibility-based security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) in the presence of false data injection (FDI) attack into the communication infrastructure of electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL). Herein, the uncertain EVPLs are integrated into the SCUC problem with the aim of reducing the operation cost. It is notable that growing integration of unspecified EVPLs can introduce novel challenges to the power system, significantly impacting its flexibility. In this study, electric vehicles are leveraged as a means to enhance system flexibility. Meanwhile, the FDI attacks in EVPLs can distort the system's flexibility and lead to inaccurate assessments of the power system's ability to adapt to changing conditions. In order to model the FDI attack, a bi-level optimization problem based on mixed integer linear programming is formulated. At the upper level, the impact of EVPLs on the flexibility indices of the SCUC is evaluated, and the false data injected into the EVPL is calculated at the lower level. Since both levels of the proposed FBSCUC<inf>FDI</inf>P-P/EV include discrete variables, a reformulation and decomposition technique is utilized to achieve the optimal solution. Instead, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based machine learning method is considered to detection and correction of FDI attack. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 24-bus system. The simulation results initially indicate the improvement of the flexibility of the power system in proposed structure. Further, injecting false data into all available EVPLs causes to increase the system operation cost. Besides, false data leads to distorted charging and discharging scheduling of EVPLs; likewise, scheduling and commitment of power generation units also changes. Subsequently, the application of the XGBoost algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of FDI attacks, achieving a maximum accuracy of 85.41%. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.ijepes.2024.110180,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2024.110180,17,high

The presence of these stations is crucial in facilitating the provision of fuel for FCEVs, which rely on hydrogen as a source of power generation. Renewable energy sources offer significant advantages for hydrogen production at these stations, as they are environmentally friendly and can reduce costs. In this study, it is provided a techno-economic analysis of an on-site hydrogen refuelling station powered by a hybrid renewable energy generation system using HOMER software in Niğde, Türkiye, and Zaragoza, Spain. Three different power system scenarios were evaluated to refuel 24 vehicles per day for each region throughout the year. The results of the analysis showed that the most optimal system architecture for Niğde was with a solar panel power generation system, with a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 6.15 $/kg and the net present cost (NPC) of $6,832,393. The most optimal system architecture for Zaragoza was a wind turbine-photovoltaic panel power generation system, with an LCOH of 5.83 $/kg and NPC of $6,499,723. The annual amount of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions avoided by using renewable resources in hydrogen production was calculated as 2,673,453 kg for Niğde and 2,366,573 kg for Zaragoza. The study also found that the cost of hydrogen production increases with decreasing the HRS production capacity. The use of renewable energy generation systems for hydrogen production will enable countries to achieve net-zero emission targets and reduce the need to import fossil fuels to meet energy demands in the transportation sector. The present study makes several contributions towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (3, 7, 11, and 13) and has the potential to facilitate the rapid adoption of FCEVs. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.02.068,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.02.068,17,high
maybe,,Optimal expansion planning of electrical energy distribution substation considering hydrogen storage,"Electricity network operators undertake important responsibilities such as balancing electricity demand and supply, minimizing power outages, and making the necessary maintenance, repairs, and investments to provide safe and continuous energy. In this context, the most significant challenge encountered today is the need for a more immediate renewal of distribution grid expansion plans, owing to the rapid increase in energy demand and the grid integration of renewable energy power plants and electric vehicle charging stations. In order to find a solution to this issue, an active distribution network has been analyzed under five scenarios based on load demand forecasting. The artificial neural network method has been employed for the forecast of load demand, and the DigSilent Power Factory (DPF) model of the distribution network has been utilized to analyze the effects of scenarios. Connecting PV plants with capacities of 3 MW and 5 MW to different feeders in the distribution network, along with Hydrogen Energy Storage (HES) with a capacity of 1 MW to one feeder, has resulted in a reduction of the distribution transformer's occupancy rate from 79.8% to 70.6%. The contribution of a 1 MW HES system to the transformer occupancy rate was determined to be 1.3%.

maybe,,Gradient-aware trade-off control strategy dynamic optimization for a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle,"Road gradients not only affect the actual performance of control strategies but also impact battery life due to the drastic changes in power demands. To balance battery degradation with fuel economy using gradient information, this study proposes a gradient-aware trade-off control strategy. Initially, a vehicle dynamics model and a battery degradation model are established. Based on the characteristics of known road information and remaining driving distance, state of charge planning of the battery is conducted. Subsequently, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II is applied for bi-objective optimization, yielding a set of Pareto solutions that represent different levels of energy consumption and battery degradation. Thereafter, by introducing a real-time battery degradation severity factor, an optimized bias coefficient is obtained, which adjusts in accordance with the gradient changes. Through the optimization of the bias line, the optimal bias solution set under different working conditions is determined, achieving the optimal control for power system. The fuel economy of the proposed strategy is improved by 6.8% relative to the mileage adaptive Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy, and the battery degradation inhibition is improved by 9.3%. After real-world conditions validation, the proposed strategy demonstrates good performance in both economic efficiency and battery life. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.07.250,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.07.250,17,high
maybe,,Integrated planning of hydrogen supply chain and reinforcement of power distribution network for accommodating fuel cell electric vehicles,"Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) hold great promise for achieving sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation. However, their widespread adoption depends on the efficient development of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) required for refueling these vehicles. Given the interdependence between the HSC and power distribution networks (PDNs), this paper presents an innovative model to jointly plan the HSC and reinforce PDNs. In this new model, the inherent uncertainties related to wind energy generation, load demand, and FCEV consumption are modeled. Furthermore, coordinating the planning of hydrogen storage and battery energy storage systems is incorporated. The results underscore the critical importance of simultaneous planning for the HSC and PDN reinforcement. Moreover, the findings reveal that hydrogen storage alone can provide sufficient energy arbitrage, leading to a 9.6% reduction in total costs compared to the scenario where storage is disregarded. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.07.316,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.07.316,17,high

An efficient operational strategy is proposed considering both short-term H<inf>2</inf> storage (STHS) and long-term H<inf>2</inf> storage (LTHS), ensuring uninterrupted power supply. Besides, a novel Improved Harris Hawk Optimization method is developed to enhance the global search capabilities and convergence rate in optimizing the capacity of Solar module, Electrolyzer, and Fuel cells. The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the device costs, energy loss, and carbon emissions, adhering to all operational constraints. The proposed work is tested on 33-bus radial DN and 51-bus real Indian DN considering the time frame of 10 years. The analysis reveals that the PV-STHS-LTHS configuration, reduces total planning costs by 12% and 15% as compared to the base case in the 33-bus and 51-bus systems, respectively. Additionally, the integration of both daily and seasonal storage facilities with PV systems leads to a reduction in carbon emissions by 76% and 81% in the 33-bus and 51-bus systems, respectively.

maybe,,A joint planning strategy for EV charging system towards net-zero transportation electrification,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are pivotal in the progression toward sustainable transportation. However, a growing body of recent studies has challenged the often-assumed notion that electric vehicles are often considered to be net-zero emissions. These studies suggest that electric vehicles could potentially generate substantial emissions due to their reliance on fossil fuels to generate electricity, especially when receiving fast charging services. This phenomenon has been mitigated with the use of renewable energy sources in the power system. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, additional requirements have arisen. To address this situation, this paper presents an interdisciplinary study of collaborative fast-charging stations (FCS) and distributed renewable energy planning based on the interactions between traffic and power networks in order to increase the adoption rate of electric vehicles and reduce emissions caused by traffic and power systems. The locations and sizing of fast-charging stations, distributed photovoltaic generation, and renewable energy power supply for electric vehicles are determined in the proposed strategy through multi-objective integer programming. The proposed planning strategy considers heterogeneous electric vehicle driving range constraints, the operation security of the power distribution system, the reliability and expansion of the current power distribution, as well as different types of air pollutant classifications resulting from the charging behaviors. To guarantee the feasibility and accuracy of the planning results, an interactive algorithm is applied to solve the multi-objective integer model. Several cases are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed planning strategy has good performance in the planning of fast-charging stations and distributed renewable energy integration. © 2024",10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141019,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141019,17,high
maybe,,Optimal allocation of electric vehicle charging stations and distributed generation in radial distribution networks,"The widespread spread of electric vehicles requires the establishment of charging stations (EVCSs), and this is considered a large load on the network. This gives priority to distributing the stations in a way that reduces the load on the network, and in parallel, re-planning the network and supplying it with the necessary energy to maintain energy efficiency and power quality. Total energy loss minimization, voltage deviation minimization, and voltage stability index improvement are the considered power quality indices in the multi-objective function. Vehicle to grid (V2G) feature, distributed generation units (DG), and capacitor banks are used for improving system performance, by injecting the required active and reactive power. In addition, the initial and running costs of V2G, DG units, and capacitor banks are considered in the multi-objective function. The optimal sizing and allocation of charging stations, V2G, DG units, and capacitor banks are performed using a proposed Self-Adaptive Multi-Population Elitist JAYA (SAMPE-JAYA) algorithm and checked using the genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed algorithm is tested using various scenarios, two standard IEEE test systems. To emphasize the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm, it is applied on a real-world distribution system. To accommodate the optimal allocation of EVCS, which constitute 80.7 % and 78.9 % of the base active load for the IEEE 33 and 69 bus systems, respectively.

maybe,,Optimal planning of electric vehicle charging stations and distributed generators with network reconfiguration in smart distribution networks considering uncertainties,"This paper proposes an optimal planning technique for placing the multiple renewable energy (RE) based distributed generators (DGs), Distribution Static Compensators (DSTATCOMs), and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) in the radial distribution network (RDN) considering the related uncertainties. This approach gives optimal placement and sizes for DGs and DSTATCOMs as well as a number of electric vehicles (EVs) that can be charged at the EVCSs by considering the network reconfiguration (NR). The optimal allocation of EVCSs fulfills the power demand from EVs at various locations and minimizes the negative impact on the power network. The RE-based DGs considered for this work are solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind. The uncertainties related to RE-based DGs and EVCSs have been modeled by using the probabilistic-based two-point estimate method (2PEM). The best locations and sizes are identified by optimizing the individual objectives that is active power losses and voltage stability index (VSI) using the teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. Then both objectives are optimized by using the non-dominated sorting-based TLBO algorithm. Furthermore, the optimal planning approach is implemented on IEEE 33 and 69 bus test systems to demonstrate the suitability, practicality, and efficiency of the proposed optimal planning strategy. The obtained results reveal that the proposed technique is beneficial for determining the optimal locations for DGs, DSTATCOMs, and EVCSs without affecting the grid stability.

maybe,,Charging management of electric vehicles with the presence of renewable resources,"Considering the increasing use of electric vehicles, the establishment of charging stations to exchange power between the grid and electric devices, and the integration of charging stations with solar power generation sources, the optimal use of electric vehicle charging stations in the power system. The purpose of cost reduction in the presence of the intelligent environment is a challenge that must be investigated so that this platform is suitable for predicting the behaviour of vehicles and, as a result, optimizing their presence in the power network. This research presents a relatively complete radial distribution network development planning model in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the effects of electric vehicles are not considered, and only the effects of distributed production (renewable and dispatchable) are considered. Studies have been done on a sample 54-bus network, a common system in most Distribution expansion planning (DEP) articles for distribution networks. In addition, the real data of American highways have been used to create raw input data. Also, due to the distance limit, the information on vehicles under 100 miles has been received as electric vehicle information. The clustering method and Capiola multivariate probability distribution functions have created suitable vehicle scenarios during different planning years. Capiola's method increases the accuracy of vehicle load forecasting according to a predetermined growth rate. The DEP problem in this research is modeled as an optimization problem based on scenario, dynamic, and in 5 one-year time frames (5-year time horizon and one-year accuracy). The results indicate that, in the presence of electric vehicles and distributed production sources, the technical characteristics of the network are improved. Similarly, the use of DGs, in addition to reducing the cost of equipment, has reduced undistributed energy in the system. But 10,000 vehicles, which have been applied to the network as an uncontrolled load, have caused an increase in undistributed energy.

maybe,,Framework for policy prescription to sustainably steer stochastic penetration of electric vehicles and solar PV in distribution network of a developing country,"Cash-strapped distribution companies of developing countries face stochastic penetrations of solar photovoltaic units (PVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) while planning to manage their uncertain growth trajectories. Since Pakistan's power distribution sector is not technically and financially sound, this research presents a framework for policy prescription to avoid dangerously burdening distribution companies or deteriorating the grid conditions. The EV load model considers EVs' arrival and departure times based on a survey of daily commuters. The Burr distribution function is used for selecting sizes of the PVs for grid integration because it best fits sampled data of installed PVs in the country. After stochastically selecting network nodes for integrating EVs and PVs to mimic their locational growth, technical and financial parameters are evaluated with and without the net metering effect. At peak PV hour and higher PV penetration of 50%, voltage limit conformance improves from 88% to 94% if net metering is not allowed. Results show that annual net revenue increases with rising EV penetration and always remains positive in the absence of PV. However, irrespective of EV penetration level, even 25% PV penetration and consequent loss of cash inflows lead to negative net revenues. The study concludes that excessive PV penetration with net metering causes voltage instability and negative net revenues, whereas EV integration can reduce both effects. A network-wide extension of our research methodology, to representative feeders selected by clustering, is proposed as a framework for policy prescription to steer the growth of EVs and PVs integration sustainably. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ref.2024.100548,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ref.2024.100548,17,high
maybe,,Best-case-aware planning of photovoltaic-battery systems for multi-mode charging stations,"The proliferation of charging stations entails multiple challenges for power systems. In this regard, the installation of photovoltaic-battery systems may help to mitigate the negative effects of charging points. However, such assets should be carefully planned, paying attention to economic aspects, principally. Most of existing works optimize the photovoltaic-battery system in charging infrastructures taking a representative-space of the involved variables (e.g. photovoltaic potential, charging demand or energy prices). However, this approach tends to ignore low-probable scenarios. Thus, the best-case scenario for charging demand (i.e. that for which the highest charging profit is accessible) may not be included in the analysis and therefore such demand could be not attended properly, thus losing this monetary opportunity. This paper focuses on this issue and questions if considering the best-case scenario into planning photovoltaic-battery systems for charging stations is worthwhile or not. To this end, a novel best-case-aware planning tool is developed, including the best-case scenario through a novel chance-constrained formulation. The overall problem is then decomposed into a master-slave structure by which the economy of the system is optimized together with the number of scenarios for which the best-case profile can be attended. A case study serves to validate the developed tool and shed light on the questions arisen in this work. In particular, it is checked that considering the best-case scenario into planning tools is questionable from a monetary point of view. Nevertheless, its inclusion unlocks some collateral advantages such as incrementing the users’ satisfaction or reducing the grid-dependency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.renene.2024.120300,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2024.120300,17,high

However, the analysis of EV charging behaviours using real-world data remains limited due to (confidential) data availability constraints. Furthermore, while existing modelling studies have demonstrated EVs as effective tools for electricity balancing and delivery between locations, their potential remains unexplored empirically. This study aims to bridge the research gap by studying EV charging behaviours and their capacity for electricity balancing and delivery. Using data from 179,665 real-world charging sessions in Sweden, we employed statistical and clustering analysis to scrutinize charging behaviours comprehensively. Synthetic weekly charging load profiles are generated for both residential areas and workplaces, considering varying charging power levels, which can be used as inputs for large-scale EV charging load modelling. Furthermore, performance indicators are proposed to quantify the potential of EVs for electricity balancing and delivery. Results show that EVs exhibit significant potential for electricity balancing (up to 51.5 kWh daily). Many EV owners underutilize their EV battery capacity, providing an opportunity for active electricity delivery across locations.

In this context, this research investigates a wind-photovoltaic power plant to produce green hydrogen for hydrogen refueling station and to operate an electrocoagulation water treatment unit in Ostrava, Czech Republic's northeast region. The study conducts a techno-economic analysis through HOMER Pro® software for optimal sizing of the power station components and to investigate the economic indices of the plant. The power station employs photovoltaic panels and wind turbines to supply the required electricity for electrolyzers and electrocoagulation reactors. As an off-grid system, lead acid batteries are utilized to store the surplus electricity. Wind speed and solar irradiation are the key role site dependent parameters that determine the cost of hydrogen, electricity, and wastewater treatment. The simulated model considers the capital, operating, and replacement costs for system components. In the proposed system, 240 kg of hydrogen as well as 720 kWh electrical energy are daily required for the hydrogen refueling station and the electrocoagulation unit, respectively. Accordingly, the power station annually generates 6,997,990 kWh of electrical energy in addition to 85595 kg of green hydrogen. Based on the economic analysis, the project's NPC is determined to be €5.49 M and the levelized cost of Hydrogen (LCH) is 2.89 €/kg excluding compressor unit costs. This value proves the effectiveness of this power system, which encourages the utilization of green hydrogen for fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCVs). Furthermore, emerging electrocoagulation studies produce hydrogen through wastewater treatment, increasing hydrogen production and lowering LCH.

maybe,,Bi-level programming model of location and charging electric vehicle stations in distribution networks,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are currently a focal point in distribution network research due to their potential benefits. Integrating EVs into distribution networks can enhance voltage profile stability. However, unplanned EV connection and charging can lead to increased peak load power consumption, voltage profile irregularities, and heightened network losses. Addressing the placement of charging stations in distribution networks is crucial to prevent voltage drop crises and mitigate other issues. This study proposes a Bi-level particle programming optimization programming approach, utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to minimize losses and determine optimal station locations. The algorithm iteratively minimizes losses while considering location and operating costs until a stopping condition is met. Additionally, an EV charging planning algorithm is introduced to manage EV connections without exacerbating peak load or causing severe voltage drops. Simulations conducted on an IEEE 33-bus system using MATLAB analyze the proposed design's impact on power consumption, system losses, and network voltage. Simulations in an IEEE 33-bus system show that the proposed model shifts peak power consumption by about 4.6 % to about 11.6 % under different EV penetration scenarios. It achieves a reduction in the network losses by up to 0.39 %, while the voltage deviations in critical buses are minimized to enhance stability during periods of high demand for EVs. Results demonstrate that the programmed charging algorithm effectively reduces power consumption at peak load, minimizes network losses, and smooths the daily voltage profile. © 2024",10.1016/j.rineng.2024.103657,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.rineng.2024.103657,17,high

maybe,,A hierarchical structure for harnessing the flexibility of residential microgrids within active distribution networks: Advancing toward smart cities,"The increasing integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and the replacement of fossil fuel vehicles with electric types in distribution systems, while enhancing economic and environmental aspects, have introduced new challenges to network production-consumption balance due to the inherent randomness of these resources. This factor has magnified the significance of balancing markets in renewable-based distribution networks, as these markets address uncertainties and are vital for operational stability. Consequently, this paper introduces a two-stage multi-layer methodology for organizing local energy and balancing markets among Residential Microgrids (RMGs) within an Active Distribution Network (ADN). The AND operator organizes both energy and balancing markets. In the first stage, the intra-day energy market operates, engaging non-profit-seeking aggregators, RMGs, and ADN. Moving to the second stage, the intra-hour balancing market is conducted involving profit-seeking Flexible Load (FL) and Electric Vehicle (EV) aggregators, RMGs, and ADN. The ADN operator organizes both markets and can alter the network topology online within the energy market. The planning of profit-seeking aggregators is formulated using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and Strong Duality Theory (SDT) in the form of Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), considering the correlation of aggregators' profit with the satisfaction index of end-users. The simulation results of the proposed methodology on a modified 118-bus IEEE distribution test system using GAMS indicate that this approach not only provides a significant share of balancing capacities through FLs and EVs but also ensures system stability against intra-hour fluctuations across various scenarios. The results also validate that the proposed methodology achieves a reduction of 24.8 % in power losses and 5.06 % in market costs, while simultaneously ensuring profitability for both aggregators and RMGs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.scs.2024.105398,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2024.105398,17,high
maybe,,Towards sustainable urban living: A holistic energy strategy for electric vehicle and heat pump adoption in residential communities,"Electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs) are key in reducing carbon emissions from transportation and domestic heating, yet their adoption may increase peak load demands on electrical networks. One of the aims of this research is to assess the potential impact of uncontrolled EV charging on community-scale distribution networks, exploring how this could stress the existing electrical infrastructure. It also explores the role of EVs in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and smart charging applications, aiming to enhance community distribution systems. The study investigates the maximum stabilisation level achievable under various scenarios, highlighting the importance of smart energy management in integrating renewable energy and addressing uncertainties in the modelling process. Additionally, this study discusses the proposed systems' scalability, consumer behaviours' impact on the suggested energy solutions, and the potential implications of recent technological advancements for simulated communities. The research employs a sophisticated, integrative approach, combining stochastic methods with several robust energy software. Key findings suggest that uncontrolled EV charging can lead to grid capacity issues at high EV penetration levels, particularly during colder months. While smart charging and V2G technologies can moderate peak loads in many scenarios, achieving 100 % sustainable technology integration requires enhanced energy management or increased network capacity, especially in winter. Wind and solar power integration demonstrates strategic complementarity, particularly in winter, enhancing the reliability and stability of the community grid. It is also observed that peak solar generation hours misalign with the community's highest demand times, posing challenges for solar energy utilisation in EV charging in residential-based areas. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.scs.2024.105412,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2024.105412,17,high
maybe,,Optimal sizing of PV–Wind generators with a smart EV charging framework to build grid friendly Net Zero Energy Campus,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) are creating a significant challenge on the electric grid as they demand huge amounts of power for their charging. On-site power generation through renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the viable approaches to meet the demands of EVs and other loads of a campus. Hence, an optimal sizing of a hybrid PV–Wind system is considered in this work to build a Net Zero Energy Campus (NZEC). Generally, EVs are scheduled after obtaining the size of RES through a sizing procedure. As a unique approach of this work, a smart EV charging framework is developed to model the profile of EV charging demand and this modeled load profile of EV is considered along with the local load profile of the campus for optimal sizing procedure. The size of PV–Wind sources are optimized by minimizing three objective functions such as the annual operating cost of the system (AOC), loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and total energy transfer (TET). The optimization is carried out by Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II). The maximum utilization of RES and the reduced grid congestion attained through the proposed sizing approach showcase the grid friendliness of the designed NZEC. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.scs.2024.105575,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2024.105575,17,high
maybe,,Residential demand response in the European power system: No significant impact on capacity expansion and cost savings,"Direct Load Control (DLC) is a demand response strategy in which customers receive compensation from utilities in return for permitting them to regulate the operation of specific equipment. This paper analyzes the impacts of DLC programs on the transition to renewable energy within the European electricity system towards 2060. The study quantifies the achievable hourly potential for DLC across Europe in the residential sector. By implementing and developing a DLC module within the stochastic capacity expansion model EMPIRE, we investigate how costs, long-term investments, and long-term marginal prices are affected by residential DLC participation rates. The research utilizes a comprehensive DLC dataset, including ten appliances such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, refrigeration, and others. This dataset serves as the basis for creating four storylines to investigate the integration of these programs into the European electricity system. The results indicate that residential DLC programs have some impact on grid-battery deployment, PV plant penetration, and electricity prices. In the best-case scenario, involving ambitious participation of residential loads in DLC programs without compensation, cost savings are about 1% versus not introducing DLC. The findings contribute to understanding the value of demand response programs in Europe, indicating that the savings they bring might not be sufficient to provide enough incentives or compensation for widespread participation in such programs. That is, from a long-term investment or capacity expansion perspective, it may not be worthwhile to soley include residential demand response in the planning of the electricity system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2023.101198,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2023.101198,17,high
maybe,,Efficient expansion planning of modern multi-energy distribution networks with electric vehicle charging stations: A stochastic MILP model,"This paper presents a stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model developed to address the collaborative expansion planning of modern multi-energy distribution networks, taking into account the integration of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) in the presence of uncertainties. The model is comprehensively formulated to encompass Distributed Generation (DG) resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs), and Capacitor Banks (CBs), alongside traditional expansion options like substations and circuit construction/reinforcement. The essence of this Distribution System Expansion Planning (DSEP) problem formulation lies in its stochastic approach, featuring chance constraints to effectively manage and address uncertainties. The central objective of the model is to minimize the total investment and operational expenditures associated with the DSEP problem over a designated planning horizon. The rigorous application of optimization techniques ensures the convergence of the MILP model, thereby delivering an efficient and reliable solution. The model's effectiveness is initially assessed using an 18-bus system, followed by comprehensive testing on a larger 123- bus system to gauge its robustness. Thorough performance evaluations are conducted across various case studies, encompassing both the 18- bus and 123- bus systems, culminating in the validation of the model's resilience, scalability, and replicability. These case studies encompass deterministic and stochastic methodologies across six distinct scenarios. The numerical outcomes conclusively demonstrate that the DSEP solution, when utilizing the stochastic approach without considering EVCSs, is associated with elevated costs. However, with a strategic allocation strategy for EVCSs, noteworthy reductions in investment expenditures related to substations, lines, and overall costs are notably achieved. The incorporation of uncertainty management within the DSEP problem underscores the flexibility and adaptability intrinsic to the proposed stochastic MILP model. These attributes render it ideally suited to effectively orchestrating the expansion of multi-energy distribution networks in the presence of EVCSs, thereby enhancing its utility and relevance in addressing modern energy distribution challenges. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2023.101225,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2023.101225,17,high
maybe,,Determining optimal location and size of PEV fast-charging stations in coupled transportation and power distribution networks considering power loss and traffic congestion,"The placement and sizing of plug-in electric vehicle fast-charging stations (PEVF-CS) can significantly influence traffic flow in urban transportation networks. Consequently, suboptimal choices regarding the location and size of PEVF-CSs may lead to increasing travel time and traffic congestion in transportation networks and deterioration of the power quality indexes in power distribution networks. Also, each PEVF-CS is equipped with power electronic converters that can be used as power line conditioners and active filters to compensate for the reactive power and current harmonic components due to nonlinear loads and reduce the power loss. Thus, PEVF-CSs can improve the voltage profile, decrease voltage THD, and reduce the power loss in power distribution networks. Accordingly, this paper develops a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) to determine the optimal locations and sizes of PEVF-CSs. In addition, the proposed model considers traffic congestion and power quality in the coupled transportation and power distribution networks. The model considers various load profiles and origin-destination demands to address the different operational aspects of transportation and power distribution networks. The main features of the proposed model are 1- road congestion reduction, 2- traveling time reduction, 3- power loss reduction, and 4- power quality improvement. The proposed model is implemented using GAMS software and applied to different-scale test systems in different scenarios. The results show that the proposed method decreases traffic congestion and improves power quality. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2023.101268,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2023.101268,17,high

In this context, this work proposes an efficient approach to enhance the reliability and security of radial distribution networks (RDNs) by assigning the optimal planning of uncertain multiple WTGs along with optimized PEVs charging simultaneously using a bi-level optimization strategy. The reliability indices considered are the load-oriented reliability indices, involving the energy not-supplied (ENS) and average energy no-supplied (AENS). Besides, the customer-oriented reliability indices include the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI), the system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI), and the average service unavailability index (ASUI). Moreover, the network security index (NSI) is considered, defining the risk degree of current-flow within power lines before reaching its extremes. The PEVs’ operational requirements are investigated, including their initial state of charges, arriving and departing times, as well as various controlled and uncontrolled charging patterns. The impacts of the protective devices installation, the linear failure rate of feeders, and the annual load growth on reliability and security are also addressed. The IEEE 33-bus distribution test network, with consideration of their annual datasets, is utilized to confirm the supremacy of the suggested approach. The findings show that the optimal planning of multiple WTGs along with optimized PEVs charging simultaneously successfully enhanced the values of load-oriented reliability indices, customer-oriented reliability indices, and the security index with a percentage reduction above 11%, 6%, and 33%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2024.101439,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2024.101439,17,high
maybe,,Impact of electric vehicle charging simultaneity factor on the hosting capacity of LV feeder,"What is the maximum charging rate that a distribution network (DN) can permit for electric vehicles (EVs)? This is the question we answer in this work by proposing a ``multi-period risk-based stochastic EV hosting capacity (EV-HC) framework{''}that explicitly considers the EV charging profiles and implicitly the arrival and departure times. Realistic EV charging profiles are employed to generate Monte Carlo (MC) scenarios that are subsequently utilized for EV-HC calculations. The EV-HC outcomes are assessed for critical times (CT) when distribution network incidents (DNIs) such as voltage, transformer loading, and line loading limit violations are observed. The EV charging simultaneity factor (SF) is calculated for these CT instances. We quantify the impact of SF on the EV-HC for the first time. Showcasing the efficacy of the proposed EV-HC framework and analyzing the SF and CT, we perform three realistic case studies for European DNs. These case studies vary in size (small and medium-size) and geographically different network topologies, i.e., rural, urban, and semi- urban. The EV-HC is assessed based on four distinct power levels of the chargers: 2.7 kW, 3.5 kW, 7 kW, and 11 kW. The results indicate that the EV-HC of the Belgian feeder is 7 kW and 3.5 kW per single charger for the EVs with high and low daily charging energy, respectively. We also observe that either nodal voltage violation or line or transformer overload could be the dominant attribute for EV-HC calculations. Furthermore, either at peak load time or off-peak time, the simulation results show that high SF values result in DNIs. However, peak-load periods are crucial because a low SF value can limit EV-HC.",10.1016/j.segan.2024.101581,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2024.101581,17,high

In this research, gradual decarbonization, using different hybrid, electric and hydrogen technologies for decarbonization of fleets engaged in activities such as fishery, passenger transport and transport of goods near the coast is investigated and modelled in connection to the power systems’ configuration. The energy system analysis and simulations are carried out in H2RES, a linear energy systems’ configuration optimization software. It considers capacity expansion, decommission and unit commitment in the sectors of power generation, heating, industry, and transport. In this particular case, transport sector module is expanded to provide realistic modelling of different naval fleets’ energy consumption, on the example of fishery fleet. This is performed through the inclusion of learning curves of different technologies that are expected in the naval transport, to replace the old internal combustion engine power drives and the demand curves that characterize the fishery fleet. Results include the changes in the variable renewable energy integration in the sectors of energy demand, general and bottom-up assessments of economic benefits and emissions reduction. Results demonstrate that the presented approach can offer better insights into the changes that are needed in an energy system based on renewable energy sources, in case of detailed modelling of the energy needs emphasized by a fishery fleet and different dynamics of its decarbonization.

maybe,,An optimal energy consumption calculation method of hybrid electric vehicles with frequency distribution characteristics of driving conditions,"For a series of problems in the design and optimisation of series hybrid electric vehicles caused by the driving condition input, such as a variety of user conditions, which may hinder the energy-saving ability of such vehicles. Condition construction will inevitably lead to information loss, and traditional design methods require high computational power and encounter a time disaster during the real-world condition data explosion. This study proposes a condition representation method with driving condition frequency distribution characteristics (DCFDCs) and an optimal energy consumption calculation method, that is, instantaneous battery energy balance solution and global battery energy balance correction (IBGB–GBEB) with DCFDCs. The energy consumption calculation results show that the proposed optimal energy consumption method can guarantee the accuracy of the energy consumption calculation and reduce the calculation time cost. The difference in fuel consumption between the optimal energy consumption method and the dynamic planning (DP) algorithm is only 2.50%, but the difference in the calculation time between the two methods is 87.00%. Furthermore, the practical example of hybrid power system (HPS) design parameter optimisation shows that the energy consumption calculation results obtained by the TDCR–DP and DCFDCs–MIGA methods are consistent, and the relative error is only 1.81%. However, the calculation time of the TDCR–DP method is 472 h, whereas that of the DCFDC–MIGA method is only 2.17 h, which is a calculation time reduction of more than 99.54%. The results highlight the effectiveness and time advantage of the optimal energy consumption calculation method with DCFDCs.

maybe,,A novel spatial electric load forecasting method based on LDTW and GCN,"Spatial power load forecasting is crucial for power grid planning, generation planning, dispatching, efficient power utilization, and sustainable development. The integration of new energy sources and electric vehicles has significantly altered grid loads, increasing the complexity of spatial load forecasting. However, existing techniques fail to fully consider the temporal and spatial correlation characteristics of data, leading to challenges in data identification and summarization. This reduces load forecasting accuracy and prolongs prediction time. To address these issues, a spatial electric load forecasting method based on improved scale limited dynamic time warping (LDTW) and graph convolutional network (GCN) are proposed. Firstly, the improved scale LDTW is used to improve the clustering effect of K-Mediods++, refine the type of load data, and make the subsequent model training more targeted. Secondly, the interconnections and distances of substations in a real network structure is used to build a graph model to capture the power load distribution. Finally, based on the clustering results and the graph model, GCN-LSTM is used to construct the spatio-temporal forecasting algorithm.

On the other hand, enhancing reactive power compensation in the power system gives rise to CVR implementation more effectively. This paper addresses how the power system planner could encourage investment to establish the above-mentioned topics. Here, a model for encouraging industrial loads to dynamically invest in implementing the CVR strategy over the planning horizon is presented. To make CVR implementation more efficient, investment in upgrading plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) chargers to be utilized as reactive power compensators is also considered. Industrial loads benefit from saving in their electricity bills and incentive payments that might be paid by utilities (if necessary). The objective function of the proposed planning model is to maximize the energy-saving of industrial loads and to minimize incentive payment by electric utilities over the planning horizon. This objective is achieved subject to that the investment plan is economically feasible. Moreover, power system operation constraints in the planning horizon based on AC power flow equations and voltage-dependent load models are considered. The proposed planning problem is modelled as a non-linear optimization problem that can be solved by off-the-shelf software, for example, GAMS.

The placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) significantly impacts the utility operator and electrical network. Inappropriately placed EVCS lead to challenges such as increased load, unbalanced generation, power losses, and reduced voltage stability. Incorporating distributed generation (DG) helps mitigate these issues by maximizing EV usage. This study focuses on optimizing EVCS and DG placement in radial distribution networks. The methodology employs a backward and forward sweep method for load flow analysis and utilizes the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine optimal EVCS and DG locations and sizes.

maybe,,Optimal siting and sizing of custom power system and smart parking lot in the active distribution network,"Non-linear loads, electrical vehicles (EVs) and power electronics are the sources of harmonic generation in the power system. Harmonics are the reason for the disturbance in the technical constraints and quality of the power system. These disadvantages are formed in the current and the voltage of the system branches and buses. To reduce these harmonics, active and passive power filters are used. Since active power filters (APFs) include electronic power switching devices, they are used to eliminate or reduce current or voltage harmonics. To properly reduce these harmonics and supply consumer demand, private investors (PIs) are considered to enhance the power quality, by investing in the APF units and the distribution network operator (DNO) coordinating and feeding the EVs, by equipping the network with smart parking lots. Total harmonic distortion, bus voltage profile, active power loss and energy not supplied (ENS) are considered problem attributes. Using techniques for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS), it is determined how the addition of photovoltaic (PV), energy storage system, and batteries affects the ranking of attributes from the perspectives of both DNO and PI. The best solutions are obtained in the first stage using a genetic algorithm (GA), and the attributes have been prioritized from a utility perspective in the second stage by TOPSIS. To verify the performance of GA and TOPSIS, all of the obtained results are compared with the other algorithms.

maybe,,A day-ahead energy management strategy for electric vehicles in parking lots considering multi-scenario simulations and hydrogen storage system,"This article investigated the charge and discharge management structure of electric vehicles (EVs) in intelligent parking lots (IPLs). It seems that with the expansion of renewable energy sources (RESs) as clean energy and investigation of the effects of EVs on the operation and planning of future distribution networks around the way EVs exchange energy with each other and the upstream network operator, RESs such as solar and wind sources, along with hydrogen storage are essential. Therefore, a new stochastic multi-scenario approach for charge/discharge management of EVs parked in IPL was proposed, in which a newly developed model for the IPL with a hydrogen storage system (HSS) consisting of a fuel cell, an electrolyzer, and a hydrogen storage tank was presented. In the proposed model, the constraints of upstream network and power balance constraints, with the operating constraints related to the IPL, including EVs, renewable energy sources, and the hydrogen storage system, were formulated as the most important objectives of the optimization problem. The optimization algorithm, Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO), was formulated for implementation, and its results were compared with those of the PSO and GWO algorithms. The CSO must handle a variety of practical, large-scale optimization problems. Based on the obtained results, the excess energy purchased from the upstream network or renewable sources was used as hydrogen storage for consumption during peak hours. As expected, the technical constraints and financial goals of the system were met, and the proposed system was evaluated on a 33-bus network. As the expected benefits will be the most beneficial with the presence of renewable sources, the final profit will be reduced by taking into account uncertainty for charge/discharge management in EVs such as the uncertainty of electric load, market price, wind turbine, and photovoltaic cell sources. Nonetheless, the profit obtained from renewable resources is preferable to losses resulting from the uncertainty of the system, and according to expectation, the performance of the system for managing the optimal charging and discharging of EVs in the IPL will be acceptable with the maximum profit for the grid. © 2024 The Author(s).

As of July 2023, India’s power system has seen a rapid transformation, with renewable energy, including large hydro, accounting for 40% of the total installed capacity at 177 GW. The ongoing energy transition has not only changed the country’s energy mix but also brought new challenges for system operators. The primary challenge is frequency instability due to the reduction of system inertia and governor-based primary frequency response (PFR) availability by large-scale integration of uncertain renewable energy resources (RES) such as wind and solar photovoltaic generators. Furthermore, the absence of frequency control ancillary services market, inadequate penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and uncertainty of RES generation enhance the complexity of the frequency response services in the Indian power system. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the frequency response challenges of the future low-carbon Indian power system and underlines the new potential fast frequency response (FFR) services from advanced energy storage and renewable generation technologies. Such FFR services can be swiftly deployed in low-inertia grids through the integration of energy storage systems and inverter-based resources in a shorter span. Modeling of FFR services in security constraint unit commitment (SCUC) can enhance grid resiliency and facilitate high penetration of RES in the Indian power system without loss of frequency stability. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/15325008.2024.2329325,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1080/15325008.2024.2329325,17,high

This article addresses the placement and scheduling of EVCS and BSS within a radial distribution network (RDN) overlaid with a road network. Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) and Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP) is introduced to reduce EV energy consumption during trips to EVCS and BSS. A Bi-layer optimization approach is used, with the outer layer minimizing energy loss by allocating EVCS and BSS optimally, and the inner layer optimizing scheduling considering associated costs. Uncertainties related to EV is considered on a real-time trip basis and modelled using 2m-Point estimation method. The problem is solved using Differential Evolution (DE) and Prairie Dog Optimization (PDO) techniques. PDO results in a 9.6% reduction in total energy losses and a 22.5% decrease in total associated costs by optimally placing EVCS at 69, 25,114 and BSS at 19, 84,113 of the RDN compared to DE.

Due to their rapid response, batteries are attractive for providing ancillary services (AS), such as frequency regulation and reserve services, to the bulk power grid. On the other hand, an electric vehicle (EV) is viewed as a moving battery; consequently, EVs are also suitable for those services. This research proposes a linear planning model for an Electric Vehicle Aggregator (EVA) within a distribution network (DN) to offer Ancillary Services (AS) to the bulk power grid. The model takes into account contract design by identifying optimal incentives or charging tariffs that Electric Vehicle (EV) owners would be willing to pay the EVA for charging their vehicles. Additionally, the model takes into account the size of the electric vehicle (EV) fleet as a crucial planning factor for EV aggregation that depends on the energy pricing set by the EVA.

Conventional power flow (PF) approaches such as forward-backward sweep (FBS) and Newton-Raphson require a high number of iterations to solve non-linear PF equations making them computationally very intensive. PF is the most important study performed by utility, required in all stages of the power system, especially in operations and planning. This paper discusses the applications of deep learning (DL) to predict PF solutions for three-phase unbalanced power distribution grids. Three deep neural networks (DNNs); Radial Basis Function Network (RBFnet), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are proposed in this paper to predict PF solutions. The strength of the proposed DNN models over the traditional iterative-based PF solvers is that these models can capture the nonlinear relationships in PF calculations to accurately predict the solutions. The PF problem is formulated as a multi-output regression model where two or more output values are predicted based on the inputs. The training and testing data are generated through the OpenDSS-MATLAB COM interface. These methods are completely data-driven where the training relies on reducing the mismatch at each node without the need for the knowledge of the system. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that the models can accurately predict the PF solutions for the unbalanced distribution grids with mutual coupling and are robust to different R/X ratios, topology changes as well as generation and load variability introduced by the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs). To test the efficacy of the DNN models, they are applied to IEEE 4-node and 123-node test cases, and the American Electric Power (AEP) feeder model.

To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA methodology for a comprehensive and unbiased approach. This review contributes to the existing literature by highlighting critical gaps and proposing a framework that can possibly bridge these gaps. The review identifies several critical gaps in current research, including: 1) Transportation-focused studies largely ignore electrical grid constraints; 2) Electrical-focused research often relies on statistically modeled EV charging demand, which may include some geographical assumptions; 3) Multidisciplinary approaches integrating both transportation and electrical networks are still in early stage; 4) Dynamic traffic flow of EVs is rarely considered; 5) Exact optimization methods largely rely on linearized or approximated models; 6) Dominance of approximate methods in transportation and electrical network modeling, primarily relying on evolutionary algorithms; and 7) Hybrid approaches are mainly utilized to solve a specific part of the problem rather than enhancing the quality of the solution.

However, in existing studies, charging scheduling is divided into a power system perspective focusing on grid stability and a transportation perspective focusing on the optimal operation of EVs. As EVs affect both systems, it is necessary to consider both grid operation and transportation-network operation simultaneously. In this study, an integrated operation algorithm for the transportation network and power grid has been developed, which determines the amount of demand response through the power-flow results at the upper level and resolves traffic congestion by setting the optimal route for EVs at the lower level.

The standard optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which is naturally nonlinear, has become even more complex with the addition of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles along with traditional thermal power generators. This increased complexity comes from the unpredictable and intermittent nature of these new resources. Monte Carlo techniques are used to estimate the production costs of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and analyze their viability. The uncertainty of the renewable sources and PEVs is modeled using Weibull, lognormal, and normal probability distribution functions (PDFs). The comprehensive OPF, incorporating renewable energy components and PEVs, is cast as a single objective problem encompassing various objectives, such as decreasing fuel costs, total emissions, voltage deviations, and real transmission losses.

By determining the optimal sitting, size and cost of the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), these power quality issues & threats can be overcome as BESS can rapidly inject or absorb power as needed. In case of any cyber threat, it can supply energy to critical areas, reducing the cascading effect and increasing the survivability of the distribution network. Therefore, this paper provides a review of the existing methodologies used for the optimal placement, sizing, and cost of BESS in distributed networks involving Distributed Energy Resources and Electric Vehicles.

maybe,,Optimal Planning of Fast EV Charging Stations in a Coupled Transportation and Electrical Power Distribution Network,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) can effectively mitigate global warming issues while ensuring energy security, when compared with conventional fuel-based vehicles. Therefore, proper planning and development of charging infrastructure are essential to promote EVs. This paper proposes a multi-objective formulation to determine fast charging stations’ optimal placement and sizing on intra-city corridors in a coupled transportation and Electrical Power Distribution Network (EPDN). The proposed formulation does a distance-based mapping between all transportation and EPDN nodes for precisely observing the impact of EV charging on EPDN. The proposed planning simultaneously considers the objectives and constraints of the transportation network and EPDN while satisfying the EV charging requirements. The EV charging demand, utilized in planning, is predicted using the Random Forest technique while considering the day type, hourly weather, and traffic flow that affect the forecasting accuracy. The improved Particle Swarm Optimization with Constriction Factor solves the proposed formulation for a 30-node EPDN coupled with a 25-node transportation network. The analysis of various cases, including varying initial State-Of-Charge of EVs and percentage growth of EVs per year, proves the efficacy and robustness of the proposed work. Note to Practitioners—The planned deployment of charging infrastructure is critical to facilitate EVs’ adoption and sustainable growth of EV industries. Since, EV charging stations couple transportation network and EPDN, the planning strategy should consider requirements of both networks. For satisfactory driving experience of EV users, the planning should also consider driving range constraints and charging requirements of EV users. Several works on charging infrastructure planning have been carried out. However, several aspects relevant to EV users, transportation networks, EPDN, and determining EV charging demand have been overlooked in existing literature (as evidenced through Table I). These aspects must be considered simultaneously while planning charging stations. Hence, this work proposes a planning strategy for optimal placement and sizing of fast EV charging stations in a metropolitan city connecting multiple suburbs while considering several aspects of transportation networks and EPDNs. The proposed strategy can be utilized by utilities for efficient deployment of charging infrastructure on metropolitan city intra-city corridors. It establishes a distance-based mapping between all transportation and EPDN nodes for observing the impact of EV charging on EPDN. The determination of EV charging demand is a crucial step in the planning, which is determined by forecasting hourly traffic flow while considering several key attributes. The proposed approach achieves the EPDN objectives of reducing power loss, voltage deviation, and total charging stations’ establishment cost, and transportation network objectives of maximising captured traffic flow while satisfying driving range constraints and charging requirements of EVs. Therefore, the focus is to utilize the existing grid infrastructure optimally while achieving the objectives and satisfying constraints of EV users, transportation network, and EPDN.

However, existing planning models for HRSs tend to focus on the interior of the city, the research on the planning of HRSs in highway networks, as well as the optimal allocation of hydrogen that can exist between HRSs is usually ignored. This article proposed a collaborative planning method for HRSs in highway networks that included photovoltaic (PV) and hydrogen allocation. First, based on the Floyd algorithm and the Monte Carlo algorithm, this article proposed a charging demand simulation method for HRSs in highway networks. Then we proposed an HRSs energy allocation method using hydrogen as backup mobile energy which aims to realize the cross-space energy dispatch of multi-site PV power generation and improve the energy supply reliability of the HRSs. Finally, based on the above research, considering the safety constraints of the power system along the highway network and the installed capacity constraints of the PV power generation system, we proposed an HRSs planning model including electric-hydrogen conversion devices and storage systems. This method minimizes the transportation cost of hydrogen by rationally planning the amount of hydrogen tube trailers (HTTs) and transportation routes, realizes cross-space energy scheduling of multi-site PV power generation, and thereby improving the energy supply reliability of HRSs and the consumption rate of PV power generation.

maybe,,Optimal Sizing and Siting of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in Distribution Networks With Robust Optimizing Model,"Optimal planning of power distribution systems with local resources is crucial to meet energy demand and avoid disruptions in energy supply for consumers. This requires the system operators to manage available resources and utilize suitable risk management tools to control and study uncertainties and their potential consequences. This paper proposes an uncertainty-based optimization framework based on the robust optimization and scenario methodology for optimal sizing and siting of electrical vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The proposed model seeks to take advantage of the flexibility introduced by EVCSs and gain financial profit for the operator of the power distribution system through reducing power losses and offering services to electricity markets. To handle the uncertainties posed by different resources, two risk measures are employed simultaneously. The uncertainty originating from the state of charge (SOC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is addressed through stochastic programming, while the robust optimization method (ROM) enables the operator of the power distribution system to be informed of the consequences of uncertainty in electricity load. Therefore, appropriate strategies can be taken to tackle the uncertainties while keeping the system operation stable and gaining financial profit. Thus, three strategies are studied in the proposed model as follows: risk-neutral, risk-averse, and risk-taker. In addition, the non-linear terms in power flow modeling were linearized through a set of linear functions which transforms the proposed model to a MILP problem. The IEEE 33-bus test system under different levels of load uncertainty and considering the uncertainty in SOC of EVs is utilized to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model.

A number of studies have shown that second-life batteries (SLBs) from EVs usually have a considerable remaining capacity and hence still have additional utilization value. This article proposes a novel fuzzy inference system (FIS)-based planning framework for EV charging stations with wind, PV power, battery energy storage system and the utilization of SLBs (EVCS-WPE-SLBs system). In this framework, a narrowed and the most probable candidate node set for EVCS-WPE-SLBs system which makes the trade-off of several off-site factors from different fields that jointly determine the optimal planning results is obtained, including the installation and utilization requirements of SLBs, the transportation network features and power system properties. Numerical case studies are conducted on a coupled IEEE 33-bus distribution system and 25-node transportation system. According to the simulation results, the reasonable utilization of SLBs in the EVCS-WPE-SLBs system can reduce the total system cost while maintaining the normal operation of the system. Besides, a narrowed and most probable candidate node set not only reduces the search space and simplifies the optimization problem, but the results obtained are more practical according to the actual system conditions in real life.",10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3324001,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpwrs.2023.3324001,17,high
maybe,,A Bilevel EV Charging Station and DC Fast Charger Planning Model for Highway Network Considering Dynamic Traffic Demand and User Equilibrium,"The rapid electric vehicle (EV) adoption and relatively short EV driving range urge city planners to expand charging infrastructure (i.e., EV charging stations (EVCSs) and direct current fast chargers (DCFCs)) in the highway network for supporting long-distance intercity EV travels. To properly address distinct roles as well as interactions of the EVCS planner, traffic network, power distribution networks (PDNs), and drivers, this paper explores a bilevel planning model in which the upper level determines EVCS and DCFC construction plans and the two lower-level subproblems describe the user equilibrium-based traffic assignment model of the traffic network and the operation model of PDNs. Moreover, the statistical charging time is modeled in the traffic network subproblem as a function of statistical charging demand and the number of DCFCs, leveraging the macro traffic pattern and micro charging behavior of individual drivers with balanced accuracy and computational complexity. The proposed model also captures the impacts of social factors, charging infrastructure, and driver behaviors on dynamic EV traffic demands. Reformulation and linearization techniques are applied to convert the proposed bilevel problem into a tractable single-level mixed-integer linear programming model for effective computation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on an intercity highway network with multiple PDNs. The findings from numerical case studies highlight the important interplay among the construction plans of EVCSs and DCFCs, the PDN constraints, the user equilibrium traffic network, and the EV drivers. Case studies illustrate the feasibility and necessity of considering the number of DCFCs to calculate the macro-perspective charging time in the user equilibrium traffic network model. The dynamic traffic demand, induced by social factors and traffic demand elasticity, was also found to be a crucial factor in reshaping EV traffic. Thus, properly considering these important factors would lead to a more accurate quantification of traffic demands and ultimately result in a more reasonable charging facility construction plan.",10.1109/TSG.2023.3275013,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2023.3275013,17,high

Equipped with energy storage devices, EV aggregation can provide reliable SFR. However, the main challenge is to guarantee reliable intra-interval SFR capacities and inter-interval delivery following the automatic generation control (AGC) signal. Furthermore, aggregated EV SFR provision will be further complicated by the EV charging time anxiety because SFR provision might extend EV’s charging time. This paper proposes a deliverable EV SFR provision with a charging-time-constrained control strategy. First, a charging-time-constrained EV aggregation is proposed to address the uncertainty of EV capacity based on the state-space model considering the charging-time restriction of EV owners. Second, a real-time economic dispatch and time domain simulation (RTED-TDS) cosimulation framework is proposed to verify financial results and the dynamic performance of the EV SFR provision. Last, the proposed charging time-constrained EV aggregation is validated on the IEEE 39-bus system. The results demonstrate that with charging time-constrained EV aggregation, the dynamic performance of the system can be improved with a marginal increase in total cost. More importantly, the charging time constraint can be respected in the proposed SFR provision of the EV aggregation.",10.1109/TSG.2024.3356948,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2024.3356948,17,high
maybe,,Adaptive Distributionally Robust Planning for Renewable-Powered Fast Charging Stations Under Decision-Dependent EV Diffusion Uncertainty,"When deploying fast charging stations (FCSs) to support long-distance trips of electric vehicles (EVs), there exist indirect network effects: while the gradual diffusion of EVs directly influences the timing and capacities of FCS allocation, the decisions for FCS allocations, in turn, impact the drivers’ willingness to adopt EVs. This interplay, if neglected, can result in uncovered EVs and security issues and even hinder the effective diffusion of EVs. In this paper, we explicitly incorporate this interdependence by quantifying EV adoption rates as decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) using decision-dependent ambiguity sets (DDASs). Then, a two-stage decision-dependent distributionally robust FCS planning (D3R-FCSP) model is developed for adaptively deploying FCSs with on-site sources and expanding the coupled distribution network. A multi-period capacitated arc cover-path cover (MCACPC) model is incorporated to capture the EVs’ recharging patterns to ensure the feasibility of FCS locations and capacities. To resolve the nonlinearity and nonconvexity, the D3R-FCSP model is equivalently reformulated into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming by exploiting its strong duality and applying the McCormick envelope.

At the upper level, a distribution company decides the optimal deployment of WCL, subject to PDN constraints. With the upper-level WCL deployment decisions, in the lower level, each EV makes optimal routing and charging decisions to minimize the sum of its travel and charging costs.

However, high initial costs and a lack of infrastructure, power storage, and power quality (PQ) are potential concerns for RESs and EVs in power systems. Among the numerous power quality (PQ) devices, the unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) can compensate for voltage and current-related PQ difficulties, correct the power factor, and is well suited for coordinative operation and control with RESs uncertainty. The position, size, and dynamic VAr control of UPQC, on the other hand, are key influencing variables for enhancing the performance and PQ of electrical distribution systems (EDSs). This paper describes an upgraded UPQC configuration known as open-UPQC (UPQC-O) for reducing PQ difficulties caused by the inclusion of PVs and EVs. Further, an efficient gazelle optimization algorithm (GOA) is suggested to solve the multi-objective optimal allocation of the PV-UPQC-O issue with an emphasis on voltage quality, distribution losses, and voltage stability. Simulations were performed for various scenarios using a modified IEEE 33-bus test system. According to the comparison data, the PV-UPQC-O improved the feeder performance more effectively than the standard UPQC and UPQC-O. The proposed PV-UPQC-O results for total loss reduction of 76.15% when compared to base case without EV load penetration. On the other hand, it is around 76.52% reduction when compared to base case with EV load penetration.

This problem was inherently complex due to the involvement of numerous integer variables. Furthermore, the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources (RESs) like wind turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) has accelerated the transition to sustainable energy. However, widespread incorporation of such RESs into the power system grid has introduced substantial challenges, particularly related to increased operational uncertainties. In this study, the UC problem was constructed as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) using objective function derived from the total fuel costs of thermal generation units, linearized using a piece-wise method. The UC problem was further enhanced by incorporating a second life electric vehicle battery (SL-EVB) to mitigate the intermittency of RES outputs, thereby effectively reducing total fuel costs. The UC issue was implemented by employing a General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software under a CPLEX solver. To assess the efficacy of the proposed approach, the IEEE 118-bus system was employed.

For this purpose, a random simulation-based method is first developed to provide the tractable formulations of the adjustable charging load and reserve provision from EVs. This method avoids the unrealistic assumption that EVs drive and charge every day, which often exists in prior relevant approaches. Based on the random simulation, this paper proposes a novel GSEP optimization model which incorporates the weekly adjustable charging load of EVs.

Renewable energy integration is encouraged by legislative measures in Italy. Although not modeled here, they serve as a backbone for the assumptions of increasing these investments. For Procida, rooftop photovoltaics (PV) coupled with energy storage are integrated in the residential, public, and tertiary sectors. A price-based strategy is also applied reflecting the Italian electricity tariff structure. At a certain price difference between peak and off-peak, the electricity supply mix changes, favoring storage technologies and hence decreasing imports by up to 10% during peak times in the year 2050. In Norway, renewable energy resources are abundant. The analysis for Hinnøya showcases possible cross-sectoral flexibilities through electrification, leading to decarbonization.

To maximize the economic benefits and station utilization under practical constraints set by regulatory authorities, utilities and DCFC station operators, this study explores and provides methods for connecting DCFC stations to the grid, employing low-power interconnection rules and distributed energy resources (DERs). The system uses automotive second-life batteries (SLBs) and photovoltaic (PV) systems as energy buffer and local energy resources to support EV charging and improve the station techno-economic feasibility through load shifting and charge sustaining. The optimal sizing of the DERs and the selection of the grid interconnection topology is achieved by means of a design space exploration (DSE) and exhaustive search approach to maximize the economic benefits of the charging station and to mitigate high-power demand to the grid. Without losing generality, this study considers a 150 kW DCFC station with a range of DER sizes, grid interconnection specifications and related electricity tariffs of American Electric Power (AEP) Ohio and the Public Utility Commission of Ohio (PUCO). Various realistic scenarios and strategies are defined to account for the interconnection requirements of the grid to the DCFC with DERs. The system’s techno-economic performance over a ten-year period for different scenarios is analyzed and compared using a multitude of metrics. The results of the analysis show that the the integration of DERs in DCFC stations has a positive impact on the economic value of the investment when compared to traditional installations. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/en17164012,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en17164012,17,high

EV and DG coordination optimization with the use of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology along with system reconfiguration optimization is developed to provide collective revenues and address integrational complications that may occur by additional system loading due to EV charging and EV-DG energy exchanges. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizes the EV charging/discharging in synergies with renewable DGs to maximize benefits that can be captured by their collaborative participation in electricity market and through renewable energy arbitrage. The developed EV charging/discharging optimization is implemented in a real 134-bus distribution network and is evaluated for its potential operational implications, namely, increased system losses. A system reconfiguration is then proposed to reduce the system losses by optimizing the flow of power through switching on/off the connections within the micro-grid and/or with other distribution systems. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in not only providing collective revenues, but also in enhancing the system operation by reducing the losses of the distribution grid.

Scene generation is an effective method to solve the uncertainty problem of stochastic planning of integrated systems of new energy generation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scenario generation and scenario reduction model of photovoltaic (PV) output and electric vehicle (EV) load power under extreme weather based on the copula function. Firstly, the non-parametric kernel density estimation method is used to fit a large number of sample data. The kernel density estimation expressions of PV and EV powers under extreme weather conditions are obtained and the corresponding goodness of fit tests are carried out. Then, a variety of joint distribution models based on the copula function are established to judge the goodness of fit of each model, and the optimal copula function is selected as the joint probability distribution function by combining the Kendall and Spearman correlation coefficients of each model. Finally, the optimal copula joint probability distribution is used to generate PV and EV power scenarios. The data of extremely hot weather in a certain province were selected for an example analysis. The results show that the output scenario obtained conforms to the correlation under this extreme weather, and has higher accuracy in reflecting the actual PV output and load power in this province under this extreme weather, which can provide a reference for reliability analyses of power systems and power grid planning. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/wevj15010011,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/wevj15010011,17,high

maybe,,Dynamic Charging Optimization Algorithm for Electric Vehicles to Mitigate Grid Power Peaks,"The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) presents both opportunities and challenges for the electrical grid. While EVs offer a promising avenue for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, their uncoordinated charging behavior can strain grid infrastructure, thus creating new challenges for grid operators and EV owners equally. The uncoordinated nature of electric vehicle charging may lead to the emergence of new peak loads. Grid operators typically plan for peak demand periods and deploy resources accordingly to ensure grid stability. Uncoordinated EV charging can introduce unpredictability and variability into peak load patterns, making it more challenging for operators to manage peak loads effectively. This paper examines the implications of uncoordinated EV charging on the electric grid to address this challenge and proposes a novel dynamic optimization algorithm tailored to manage EV charging schedules efficiently, mitigating grid power peaks while ensuring user satisfaction and vehicle charging requirements. The proposed ``Proof of Need{''} (PoN) charging algorithm aims to schedule the charging of EVs based on collected data such as the state of charge (SoC) of the EV's battery, the charger power, the number of connected vehicles per household, the end-user's preferences, and the local distribution substation's capacity. The PoN algorithm calculates a priority index for each EV and coordinates the charging of all connected EVs at all times in a way that does not exceed the maximum allocated power capacity. The algorithm was tested under different scenarios, and the results offer a comparison of the charging power demand between an uncoordinated EV charging baseline scenario and the proposed coordinated charging model, proving the efficiency of our proposed algorithm, thus reducing the charging demand by 40.8\% with no impact on the overall total charging time.",10.3390/wevj15070324,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/wevj15070324,17,high

The performance and efficiency of both Distributed Generation (DG) and Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure are significantly affected by global temperature variation characteristics, which are taken into consideration in this study as it investigates the effects of these integrations. This scenario is further complicated by the unbalanced structure of distribution networks, which introduces inequalities that can enhance complexity and adverse effects. This paper analyzes the manner in which temperature changes influence the network operational voltage profile, power quality, energy losses, greenhouse harmful emissions, cost factor, and active and reactive power losses using analytical and heuristic techniques in the IEEE 69 bus network in both three-phase balance and modified unbalanced load conditions. In order to maximize adaptability and efficiency while minimizing the adverse impacts on the unbalanced distribution system, the findings demonstrate significant variables to take into account while locating the optimal location and size of DG and EV charging stations. To figure out the objective, three-phase distribution load flow is utilized by the particle swarm optimization technique. Greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 61.4%, 64.5%, and 60.98% in each of the three temperature case circumstances, while in the modified unbalanced condition, they dropped by 57.55%, 60.39%, and 62.79%.

To this end, this paper proposes an optimal EV charging schedule in order to allocate the charging of EVs in non-overlapping time slots, aiming to avoid overloading conditions that could stress the DN operation. The problem is structured as a linear optimization problem in GAMS, and the linear Distflow is utilized for the power flow analysis required.

maybe,,Distribution Network Target Framework Planning Algorithm Based on Fuzzy Optimization and Grey System Theory,"INTRODUCTION: The global energy transition, driven by the rapid growth of distributed renewable energy, stochastic load profiles (e.g., EV charging spikes), and conflicting stakeholder objectives, has brought unprecedented complexities to distribution network planning. Traditional deterministic methods fail to handle qualitative fuzziness (e.g., subjective reliability thresholds) and quantitative uncertainty (e.g., sparse historical data), leading to inflexible and inefficient solutions. This study addresses these challenges by developing a hybrid planning framework. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to solve the dual challenges of qualitative fuzziness and quantitative uncertainty in distribution network planning, providing a systematic solution to accommodate distributed renewable energy, handle load uncertainty, and balance conflicting stakeholder preferences through integrating fuzzy optimization theory and grey system theory. METHODS: The hybrid algorithm combines fuzzy optimization and grey system theory. Fuzzy optimization uses triangular fuzzy numbers for load growth rates ([3%, 5%, 8%]) and trapezoidal fuzzy intervals for voltage constraints ([−10%, −5%, 5%, 10%]) with membership functions (threshold λ≥0.8) to convert qualitative requirements into solvable constraints. Grey system theory applies the GM(1,1) model for load forecasting (achieving 4.2% MAPE with 15-month data) and grey relational analysis (GRA) for data-driven objective weighting to eliminate expert bias. An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is used for optimization, validated in a 33-node network with 8.5 MW PV and 6 MW wind capacity. RESULTS: In the 33-node case study, compared to the deterministic genetic algorithm (D-GA), the hybrid algorithm reduces lifecycle costs by 19% (from $8.91M to $7.23M), increases renewable energy accommodation by 24% (from 9.8 MW to 12.3 MW), and improves the system average supply availability index (ASAI) from 99.92% to 99.95%. Under extreme uncertainties (±40% renewable output, ±30% load shifts), cost deviations remain within 6% and reliability metrics within 5%, demonstrating strong robustness. CONCLUSION: This research presents a robust hybrid framework that bridges fuzzy qualitative reasoning and grey data efficiency, effectively addressing both qualitative fuzziness and quantitative uncertainty in distribution network planning. It provides a science-based tool for resilient grid design, with potential for extension to multi-energy system integration and real-time optimization in future work. © © 2025 Jinsen Liu et al., licensed to EAI.

In consequence, the public attention has shifted upstream and holistically towards the integration of large-scale transportation electrification to power systems. This paper proposes a method to identify bottlenecks in power transmission systems to accommodate large-scale and stochastic electric vehicles charging demands. First, a distributionally robust chance-constrained direct current optimal power flow model is developed to quantify the impacts of stochastic electric vehicles charging demands. Subsequently, an agent-based model with the trip-chain method is applied to obtain the spatiotemporal distributions of electric vehicles charging demands for both light-duty electric vehicles and medium and heavy-duty electric vehicles. The first two moments of those distributions are extracted to build an ambiguity set of electric vehicles charging demands. Finally, a 121-bus synthetic transmission network for New York State power systems is used to validate the future transportation electrification in New York State from 2025 to 2035. Results show that the large-scale transportation electrification in New York State will account for approximately 13.33 % to 16.79 % of the total load demand by 2035. The transmission capacity is the major bottleneck in supporting New York State to achieve its transportation electrification.

To enhance the system sustainability, it is essential to incorporate the renewable distributed generations (DGs) (like solar photovoltaic (SPV), wind turbine (WT) and biomass) and distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) of best size at suitable site in the RDS to reduce the unfavorable effects of EVCSs/EVBSS(s) demand. In addition, a novel multi-objective student psychology based optimization (MOSPBO) technique is proposed to obtain the best site and size of renewable DGs and DSTATCOM in medium RDS (such as IEEE 33-node) and large-scale RDS (like practical Brazil 136-node) for four different load models contemplating the time-sequence curves of load demand and generation of SPV and WT over 96-h. The proposed MOSPBO method is initially scrutinized on multi-objective benchmark test functions to verify its optimization proficiency.

maybe,,Power system operational impacts of electric vehicle dynamic wireless charging,"The electrification of the transportation sector poses an opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from passenger vehicles. Electric vehicle (EV) charging through dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), known as roadway electrification, could shift EV demand profiles to better coincide with renewable electricity generation. However, this would be a very large new load and few studies evaluate the regional impacts of DWPT charging in a power transmission system. This paper defines methods that address dataset generation for passenger vehicle trips and models to evaluate regional impacts for this emerging technology. Household vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data form localized EV demand profiles through discrete-event simulation. This data serves as exogenous inputs for a Production Cost Model (PCM) of a synthetic transmission system based on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s (ERCOT) network. EV charging methods are compared for both a 2018 baseline generation mixture and a high-renewable generation case incorporating 20 GW of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. The PCM employs unit commitment and economic dispatch (UC&ED) models to compare financial, environmental, and grid reliability impacts from EV charging across passenger EV adoption levels. In-transit charging could reduce grid operational costs by as much as 1.49%, with up to $13.7B saved in annual vehicle operational costs for consumers compared to gas-powered vehicles. Health impacts analysis from power plant and vehicle tailpipe emissions from this study show net health benefits increase by 40% for in-transit charging coupled with high renewable generation.

This opens up possibilities for novel approaches, such as a coalition-based V2G-enabled vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy and reserve sharing mechanism. Unlike traditional transactive energy models that often under-utilize EVs due to mismatches with smaller renewable outputs and peak loads, the proposed cooperative V2V sharing mechanism aims to maximize the use of EVs’ charging and discharging capabilities. It forms a grand coalition of EV users to optimize energy and reserve market participation. The model introduces mathematical formulations to describe how EVs collaborate in both energy and reserve markets. It ensures fairness and stability in pay allocations among users within the cooperative framework. The theoretical foundation includes proof of balance in the coalition approach and a two-stage imputation method to achieve fair and optimal payoff distribution. This minimizes incentives for users to defect from the coalition, ensuring stability. To address scalability challenges inherent in coalition formation problems, a decomposition algorithm is proposed. This algorithm enhances efficiency in solving problems that grow exponentially with the number of users.

maybe,,Multi-objectives transmission expansion planning considering energy storage systems and high penetration of renewables and electric vehicles under uncertain conditions,"Transmission expansion planning (TEP) integrating electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) is pivotal for the transition toward cleaner and more sustainable energy systems. One of the biggest challenges in TEP with EVs and RESs is the uncertainty inherent in their behaviors. Managing this uncertainty is critical for ensuring the grid's reliability and resilience, and for facilitating a seamless transition to EVs. A potent method for addressing uncertainties in power systems is the application of a scenario-based approach. However, the efficiency of this approach is contingent upon an increase in the number of representative scenarios, which, in turn, escalates computational time, making solving the TEP problem a crucial task. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-objective resilience model for TEP, to advance towards more sustainable energy systems. The model seeks to strike a balance between economic, environmental, and technical considerations by minimizing planning costs, carbon dioxide emissions, and enhancing the voltage profile. Furthermore, the paper proposes a cascaded intelligent strategy to handle uncertainties and reduce computational complexity by reducing the number of representative scenarios without compromising system reliability. The adaptive neuro-inference system is designed to manage long-term uncertainties, while two fuzzy systems are developed to address short-term uncertainties. The problem is formulated as a complex non-linear multi-objective optimization problem. To address this, a hybrid approach combining the mountain gazelle optimizer and the multi-objective salp swarm optimizer is developed to solve the problem.

While RESs offer benefits like reduced environmental pollution, decreased power losses, and enhanced power quality, their intermittent nature and uncertainties pose challenges, resulting in variable generation and instability in distribution systems. To address these challenges, the concept of aggregating distributed energy resources (DERs), battery energy storage system (BESS), electric vehicles (EVs), and controllable loads into a virtual power plant (VPP) managed by an energy management system (EMS) has emerged. This study aims to determine the optimal location and size of VPPs within radial distribution system (RDS) while considering network resilience to severe weather events. The problem is formulated as an optimization task with dual objectives: minimizing the operating cost of VPPs and reducing energy not supplied (ENS) during natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. To address this optimization problem, a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called the hunting prey optimization algorithm (HPOA) is applied. HPOA serves various functions within the RDS, specifically targeting the optimization of VPP location, VPP resource management, and the objective functions. A case study is conducted, incorporating RESs, BESS, and EVs, and compared against existing algorithms such as BESA and SMA using a standard IEEE 85-bus RDS.

While EV drivers are indispensable components for the V2G applications, the extant power system studies have underexamined the willingness of EV drivers to participate in V2G. In addition, few studies investigate whether the small-scale and time-varying V2G supply can replace utility-level energy storage. Given this background, this study combined discrete choice experiments with energy storage capacity expansion planning (ES-CEP) to simulate time-varying V2G participation and effectiveness. The choice experiments identified drivers’ preferences for V2G, which was used to simulate V2G participation under different compensation schemes. Time-varying V2G participation was integrated into ES-CEP for renewable-dominant power system to assess the potential of V2G to replace ES at the utility scale. The results showed that most drivers were unlikely to engage in V2G, although this reluctance decreased during the night. Higher guaranteed state-of-charge, accessible V2G facilities, and monetary enrollment compensation encouraged the participation. The ES-CEP results showed that, even with a limited V2G (4.5–15.3 % of EV drivers), V2G significantly reduced the optimal ES capacity (36.5–45.6 % for power and 39.6–60.6 % for energy), shaved peak netload by 18.5 %, and saved the total cost by 3.35 %, even after accounting for V2G enrollment compensation and battery degradation. EVs that charged during the daytime and participated in V2G at night were the most utilized, resulting in 0.92 % of annual battery aging, but generated a profit of 636,749 KRW (553 USD).

This research contributes to enable their protection by proposing a bi-level method to simultaneously solve the allocation and coordination problems, where the proposed scheme also includes local protections of distributed energy resources. The uncertainties associated with generation and loads are categorized by the k-means method, as well. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is employed in the upper-level task to solve the protection and control devices allocation problem with two opposing objectives. In the lower-level task, a genetic algorithm ensures their coordination. Protection devices include reclosers and fuses from the network, and directional relays for the point of common coupling of microgrids, while control devices consist of remote-controlled switches. In contrast to related works, local devices installed at the point of coupling of distributed generation units are considered as well, such as voltage-restrained overcurrent relays and frequency relays.

To address the challenges that arise from intermittent renewable generation, we explore the introduction of community batteries to provide an elegant solution for storing excess generation of renewable energy resources (RESs) and reverting to the grid in peak demand periods. In particular, determining the optimal battery type and size along with the minimum costs is challenging. Moreover, the growth in adapting electrical vehicles (EVs) imposes additional demand-related challenges on the power system, compared to the traditional industrial and household demands. This paper introduces a long-term planning strategy for community batteries to capture the surplus generation of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panels in a given area, and direct the stored energy to charge EVs, without injecting to the upstream grid. For long-term investment planning on batteries, we consider 15 years’ worth of historical data associated with solar irradiance, temperature, EV demands, and household demands. A novel stochastic mathematical model is proposed for decision-making on battery specifications (the type and capacity of the batteries needed per year) based on the four standard battery types (based on capacity) provided by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. Uncertainties related to the EVs and RESs are captured by a non-parametric robust technique, namely the information gap decision theory, from optimistic and pessimistic perspectives. The investment decision determining component is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, incorporating the GUROBI optimisation tool, that provides a feasible global solution with a low computational burden. Our proposed solution not only determines the optimal battery installation strategies to improve the stability profile of the grid by capturing the excess power of PV generation but also facilitates EV integration in the community towards reaching the net-zero emissions target.

Herein, the uncertain EVPLs are integrated into the SCUC problem with the aim of reducing the operation cost. It is notable that growing integration of unspecified EVPLs can introduce novel challenges to the power system, significantly impacting its flexibility. In this study, electric vehicles are leveraged as a means to enhance system flexibility. Meanwhile, the FDI attacks in EVPLs can distort the system’s flexibility and lead to inaccurate assessments of the power system’s ability to adapt to changing conditions. In order to model the FDI attack, a bi-level optimization problem based on mixed integer linear programming is formulated. At the upper level, the impact of EVPLs on the flexibility indices of the SCUC is evaluated, and the false data injected into the EVPL is calculated at the lower level. Since both levels of the proposed FBSCUCFDIP-P/EV include discrete variables, a reformulation and decomposition technique is utilized to achieve the optimal solution. Instead, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based machine learning method is considered to detection and correction of FDI attack. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 24-bus system. The simulation results initially indicate the improvement of the flexibility of the power system in proposed structure. Further, injecting false data into all available EVPLs causes to increase the system operation cost.

These studies suggest that electric vehicles could potentially generate substantial emissions due to their reliance on fossil fuels to generate electricity, especially when receiving fast charging services. This phenomenon has been mitigated with the use of renewable energy sources in the power system. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, additional requirements have arisen. To address this situation, this paper presents an interdisciplinary study of collaborative fast-charging stations (FCS) and distributed renewable energy planning based on the interactions between traffic and power networks in order to increase the adoption rate of electric vehicles and reduce emissions caused by traffic and power systems. The locations and sizing of fast-charging stations, distributed photovoltaic generation, and renewable energy power supply for electric vehicles are determined in the proposed strategy through multi-objective integer programming. The proposed planning strategy considers heterogeneous electric vehicle driving range constraints, the operation security of the power distribution system, the reliability and expansion of the current power distribution, as well as different types of air pollutant classifications resulting from the charging behaviors. To guarantee the feasibility and accuracy of the planning results, an interactive algorithm is applied to solve the multi-objective integer model. Several cases are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed planning strategy has good performance in the planning of fast-charging stations and distributed renewable energy integration.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141019,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141019,17,high
maybe,,Charging management of electric vehicles with the presence of renewable resources,"Considering the increasing use of electric vehicles, the establishment of charging stations to exchange power between the grid and electric devices, and the integration of charging stations with solar power generation sources, the optimal use of electric vehicle charging stations in the power system. The purpose of cost reduction in the presence of the intelligent environment is a challenge that must be investigated so that this platform is suitable for predicting the behaviour of vehicles and, as a result, optimizing their presence in the power network. This research presents a relatively complete radial distribution network development planning model in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the effects of electric vehicles are not considered, and only the effects of distributed production (renewable and dispatchable) are considered. Studies have been done on a sample 54-bus network, a common system in most Distribution expansion planning (DEP) articles for distribution networks. In addition, the real data of American highways have been used to create raw input data. Also, due to the distance limit, the information on vehicles under 100 miles has been received as electric vehicle information. The clustering method and Capiola multivariate probability distribution functions have created suitable vehicle scenarios during different planning years. Capiola’s method increases the accuracy of vehicle load forecasting according to a predetermined growth rate. The DEP problem in this research is modeled as an optimization problem based on scenario, dynamic, and in 5 one-year time frames (5-year time horizon and one-year accuracy). The results indicate that, in the presence of electric vehicles and distributed production sources, the technical characteristics of the network are improved. Similarly, the use of DGs, in addition to reducing the cost of equipment, has reduced undistributed energy in the system. But 10,000 vehicles, which have been applied to the network as an uncontrolled load, have caused an increase in undistributed energy. The cost of equipment required for the network development is almost as much as 5%.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ref.2023.100536,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ref.2023.100536,17,high
maybe,,Best-case-aware planning of photovoltaic-battery systems for multi-mode charging stations,"The proliferation of charging stations entails multiple challenges for power systems. In this regard, the installation of photovoltaic-battery systems may help to mitigate the negative effects of charging points. However, such assets should be carefully planned, paying attention to economic aspects, principally. Most of existing works optimize the photovoltaic-battery system in charging infrastructures taking a representative-space of the involved variables (e.g. photovoltaic potential, charging demand or energy prices). However, this approach tends to ignore low-probable scenarios. Thus, the best-case scenario for charging demand (i.e. that for which the highest charging profit is accessible) may not be included in the analysis and therefore such demand could be not attended properly, thus losing this monetary opportunity. This paper focuses on this issue and questions if considering the best-case scenario into planning photovoltaic-battery systems for charging stations is worthwhile or not. To this end, a novel best-case-aware planning tool is developed, including the best-case scenario through a novel chance-constrained formulation. The overall problem is then decomposed into a master-slave structure by which the economy of the system is optimized together with the number of scenarios for which the best-case profile can be attended. A case study serves to validate the developed tool and shed light on the questions arisen in this work. In particular, it is checked that considering the best-case scenario into planning tools is questionable from a monetary point of view. Nevertheless, its inclusion unlocks some collateral advantages such as incrementing the users’ satisfaction or reducing the grid-dependency.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2024.120300,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2024.120300,17,high

Within this framework, understanding the dynamic interaction among system resources becomes crucial to assess the adequacy of future electricity systems performance. This study aims to evaluate the extent to which new electricity resources will complement or substitute each other in integrating non-dispatchable electricity generation.

maybe,,Unveiling electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns and their transformative role in electricity balancing and delivery: Insights from real-world data in Sweden,"Accurately estimating the charging behaviours of electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for various applications, such as charging station planning and grid impact estimation. However, the analysis of EV charging behaviours using real-world data remains limited due to (confidential) data availability constraints. Furthermore, while existing modelling studies have demonstrated EVs as effective tools for electricity balancing and delivery between locations, their potential remains unexplored empirically. This study aims to bridge the research gap by studying EV charging behaviours and their capacity for electricity balancing and delivery. Using data from 179,665 real-world charging sessions in Sweden, we employed statistical and clustering analysis to scrutinize charging behaviours comprehensively. Synthetic weekly charging load profiles are generated for both residential areas and workplaces, considering varying charging power levels, which can be used as inputs for large-scale EV charging load modelling. Furthermore, performance indicators are proposed to quantify the potential of EVs for electricity balancing and delivery. Results show that EVs exhibit significant potential for electricity balancing (up to 51.5 kWh daily). Many EV owners underutilize their EV battery capacity, providing an opportunity for active electricity delivery across locations. This study can help understand EV charging behaviours and recognize their significant potentials for electricity regulation and integrating more renewables in the future power system.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2024.121511,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2024.121511,17,high

Moreover, hydrogen has become a promising energy carrier and green fuel to decarbonize the industrial and transportation sectors. In this context, this research investigates a wind-photovoltaic power plant to produce green hydrogen for hydrogen refueling station and to operate an electrocoagulation water treatment unit in Ostrava, Czech Republic's northeast region. The study conducts a techno-economic analysis through HOMER Pro® software for optimal sizing of the power station components and to investigate the economic indices of the plant. The power station employs photovoltaic panels and wind turbines to supply the required electricity for electrolyzers and electrocoagulation reactors. As an off-grid system, lead acid batteries are utilized to store the surplus electricity. Wind speed and solar irradiation are the key role site dependent parameters that determine the cost of hydrogen, electricity, and wastewater treatment. The simulated model considers the capital, operating, and replacement costs for system components. In the proposed system, 240 kg of hydrogen as well as 720 kWh electrical energy are daily required for the hydrogen refueling station and the electrocoagulation unit, respectively. Accordingly, the power station annually generates 6,997,990 kWh of electrical energy in addition to 85595 kg of green hydrogen. Based on the economic analysis, the project's NPC is determined to be €5.49 M and the levelized cost of Hydrogen (LCH) is 2.89 €/kg excluding compressor unit costs. This value proves the effectiveness of this power system, which encourages the utilization of green hydrogen for fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCVs). Furthermore, emerging electrocoagulation studies produce hydrogen through wastewater treatment, increasing hydrogen production and lowering LCH. Therefore, this study is able to provide practicable methodology support for optimal sizing of the power station components, which is beneficial for industrialization and economic development as well as transition toward sustainability and autonomous energy systems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2024.102234,2024,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2024.102234,17,high

The expansion and development of renewable power generation technologies is conducive in promoting the use of electric vehicles, which are more environmentally friendly. This paper proposes a multi-objective power expansion model considering renewable energy policy objectives. The model regards the problem as a multi-period optimisation task, taking the newly installed capacity and the power generation capacity of each power generation technology as decision variables, and simulating the uncertain factors in the planning process using Geometric Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo approaches. The optimisation objective of the model is to minimise expected costs, reduce risk and environmental impacts, and incorporate changing policy objectives into the constraints to meet policy makers’ expectations for renewable energy development. Then, a decentralised target search-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Its effectiveness is verified by a numerical example using real data from the Chinese power system. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits improved performance compared with benchmark algorithms and provides high quality and diverse Pareto-optimal solutions to decision makers.

maybe,,A hybrid deep learning framework for multivariate energy forecasting and peak load prediction in electric vehicle charging infrastructure,"Electric vehicles (EVs) play a pivotal role in sustainable mobility and the decarbonization of transport sector. Accurate forecasting of energy demand at EV charging station clusters (EVCSCs) is essential for optimizing smart grid operations, reducing peak load stress, and guiding cost-effective infrastructure deployment. This study presents a unified and scalable hybrid deep learning framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional LSTM and GRU units (BiLSTM/BiGRU), and attention mechanisms to model complex spatiotemporal dynamics in EV charging data. Domain-specific feature engineering, incorporating lag and rolling window statistics, is combined with Keras Tuner-based hyperparameter tuning and Genetic Algorithm-based time-step optimization to enhance the models’ adaptability and performance across diverse urban environments. Unlike conventional univariate methods, our framework supports multivariate forecasting by jointly predicting daily energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) savings, and gasoline displacement. It also includes weekly peak day forecasting, enabling utility operators to anticipate high-load periods and manage demand-side resources more effectively. The models are trained and evaluated on four real-world public datasets (Palo Alto, Boulder, Dundee, Perth) representing varying consumption patterns and feature granularities. The results demonstrate superior accuracy in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2 (up to 0.99), consistently outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.

maybe,,Sustainable planning of electric bus systems: Degradation-aware and climate-specific techno-economic analysis,"The transition to battery electric buses (BEBs) offers a promising pathway to decarbonize urban transport. However, planning their deployment requires careful evaluation of both economic and environmental trade-offs. This study presents a novel planning framework that jointly minimizes the total cost of ownership (TCO) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by optimizing onboard battery size, charger power, and number of chargers, while incorporating a detailed battery aging model to capture real-world degradation under varying temperatures and charging conditions. A comparative analysis is conducted across four cities-Singapore, Adelaide, Munich, and Calgary-each representing distinct climate profiles, electricity prices, and grid emission intensities. The study also evaluates three widely used lithium-ion battery chemistries: LFP, NMC, and NCA. Results reveal substantial variation in optimal BEB configurations across regions. Colder cities require larger batteries and higher charging power to maintain reliability, resulting in increased costs and emissions, while milder climates with cleaner grids support more cost-effective and sustainable solutions. Critically, the analysis demonstrates that no single configuration performs best across all locations or chemistries-underscoring that one-size-fits-all approaches are unsuitable for BEB planning.

This study proposes and comprehensively evaluates three Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) configurations, namely off-grid, off-grid with Vehicle-to-Home (V2H), and on-grid, integrating solar Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbines (WT), Battery Energy Storage (BES), and Electric Vehicles (EVs). It conducts a detailed techno-economic assessment of these configurations using a rule-based energy management strategy designed to identify the most balanced and sustainable design. A novel rule-based Energy Management System (EMS) is developed to enable real-time, degradation-aware dispatch that accounts for EV availability, battery and EV aging, and local renewable variability. The EMS is computationally efficient, transparent, and suitable for embedded control platforms operating in infrastructure-constrained microgrids. Using hourly simulations over a 20-year horizon with realistic solar, wind, residential load, and rural EV mobility datasets, this work assesses each configuration within a unified techno-economic, environmental, and social framework. Key performance indicators include Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), Return on Investment (ROI), lifecycle CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, employment creation, and Human Development Index (HDI) improvement. The off-grid system with V2H integration demonstrates the most balanced performance, achieving a 96.4 % renewable share, Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) of 0.00017, and a 91.2% reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions compared with the diesel baseline. It also reduces NPC to $199,235, shortens payback to 7.12 years, and increases ROI (0.755) and IRR (12.80%).

This study evaluates the hourly impact of BEV integration on Italy's energy system using a Python-based simulation model. Two scenarios are analyzed for 2024: (1) 3.5 million BEVs and (2) 7 million BEVs. The model incorporates hourly charging profiles for household and highway fast-charging, Italy's renewable energy mix (solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy), and a 5 GWh battery energy storage system. Results show that Scenario 1 increases daily electricity demand by 19 % (to 1.1 TWh), with peak loads of 47–49 GW, requiring 152 GWh of thermal generation and emitting 76,000 tons of CO<inf>2</inf> daily. Scenario 2 raises demand by 40 % (to 1.25 TWh), with peak loads of 50–53 GW, 224 GWh of thermal generation, and 112,000 tons of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Existing storage mitigates 20 % of peak load but is insufficient for Scenario 2’s 15 GW shortfall. Key demand spikes occur at 01:00 and 11:00–18:00, coinciding with home and highway charging.

However, for the effective deployment of EVs, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) must be built quickly and with careful planning. Moreover, mismatch of generation demand, active power losses, compromised voltage profile and voltage stability reduction issues are faced due to the rapid raise of electric load penetration. To address these concerns, a well-planned integration of EVCS with Distributed Generations (DGs) at strategic locations with appropriate capacity becomes essential. Load Flow Analysis is utilized to find power losses for each branch and voltage magnitudes for all buses. The IEEE 69 bus is employed with the Backward-Forward Sweep method for Radial Distribution Systems, and the IEEE 118 bus is a non-radial DS solved with the Newton–Raphson (NR) method.

The utilization of HMFO results in improved outcomes, including rapid convergence, robustness, and enhanced identification of EVCS deployment locations. Consequently, this optimization approach leads to reduced real and reactive power losses, diminished voltage deviations, increased voltage stability, cost-effectiveness, and accurate determination of EVCS location, and size.

The feasibility of i-SAO is established through rigorous statistical analysis, including box plot analysis, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and convergence characteristics analysis through CEC 2020 benchmark functions. The analysis reveals the superlative performance of i-SAO against seven other competitive algorithms in solving separate and simultaneous optimal allocation of D-STATCOMs and DGs to minimize real power loss of a standard 69 bus distribution system. The proposed methodology is then applied to a 69 bus GTMG. The results for different scenarios show appreciable attainment of considered indices in presence of optimally allocated D-STATCOMs. The analysis reveals the optimal allocation of D-STATCOMs resulted in a more secure, reliable, efficient and economic operation of a GTMG over a planning period of 5, 10 and 15 years. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125143,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125143,16,high
maybe,,Orderly solar charging of electric vehicles and its impact on charging behavior: A year-round field experiment,"Orderly charging of electric vehicles (EVs) provides a promising potential of demand-side flexibility to integrate renewable energy. However, it is often questionable in practice because of users' random and short-duration charging behavior, originating from refueling petrol vehicles. This paper proposes to guide users to charge EVs in a grid-friendly way by service mode design. We established a workplace solar charging system to provide intermittent but free charging services for employees. A year-round field experiment with typical private EV users in Beijing was conducted to demonstrate the system performance and the impact on charging behavior. Charging energy was sourced solely from rooftop photovoltaics without energy storage, covering 96.1 % of their commuting travel demand. The users developed a habit of “plugging in upon parking and keeping connected until leaving”. The mean plug-in duration increased from 2.0 h to 9.4 h (approximately the daily working hours), providing more opportunities for flexible regulation. Furthermore, the users became willing to arrive and leave with lower state-of-charge (averagely 50.3 % and 79.1 %), indicating relief of range anxiety and deceleration of battery degradation. This study provides real-world evidence for the transition of charging behavior guided by the charging service mode, which benefits EV users and contributes to grid decarbonization. © 2024",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125211,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125211,16,high
maybe,,Understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of V2G participation in megacities: A data-driven study,"Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology has the potential to enhance energy resilience and optimize electricity use, but its effectiveness depends on how participation unfolds at scale. Most existing studies rely on small-sample surveys or limited, context-specific pilot observations, overlooking the heterogeneous V2G participation shaped by mobility needs and spatiotemporal variation, which determine when, where, and how much vehicles can exchange energy and how participation scales different across diverse urban contexts. To address this gap, this study develops a data-driven agent-based modeling framework that captures heterogeneous V2G participation in megacities by integrating heterogenous mobility needs—derived from three months of trajectory data on 18,000 private battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in Shanghai—with spatial variation in land use and infrastructure. This combination reflects both seasonal dynamics and citywide heterogeneity. The model simulates daily charging and discharging decisions, with agents maximizing arbitrage profits while maintaining mobility requirements. Results show that V2G integration intensifies BEV–grid interactions at the individual level, increasing charging volumes by up to fivefold and generating average monthly net gains of 230 CNY per user. At the system level, spatiotemporal variations emerge, shaped by electricity pricing, urban–suburban context, and land-use functions. The framework also demonstrates strong adaptability and transferability, supported by submodule replacement analysis and sensitivity analysis across key parameters, providing a policy-oriented tool for anticipating user behavior and system outcomes in megacities as V2G moves beyond pilot testing. These insights support more effective infrastructure planning and regulatory strategies for a smooth and equitable transition toward large-scale V2G adoption. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126866,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.126866,16,high
maybe,,Real-time voltage regulation using fuzzy logic in single-ended primary-inductor converter for electric energy systems,"Reliable output voltage regulation in SEPIC converters is challenging due to input voltage fluctuations and dynamic load changes, which can lead to instability and degraded performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic control (FLC) strategy designed to improve transient response and steady-state accuracy without requiring an exact mathematical model. The study begins with the analytical modeling and component sizing of the SEPIC converter to guarantee continuous conduction mode and stable operation. A two-input fuzzy controller, based on voltage error and error rate, is developed and tested in a model-based design environment using MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller keeps the output voltage deviation below 2% during input disturbances and achieves faster settling compared to classical PID control. For real-time validation, the FLC is implemented on an STM32F446RE 32-bit microcontroller. Experimental results confirm that the FLC significantly reduces overshoot and settling time, enhancing dynamic performance under variable operating conditions. These findings highlight the suitability of the proposed approach for applications such as electric vehicles, robotics, and smart energy systems where robust and precise voltage regulation is required. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.compeleceng.2025.110740,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.compeleceng.2025.110740,16,high
maybe,,Electric vehicles in solar energy communities—Impact on asset dimensioning and the low-voltage grid,"The uptake of distributed, renewable generation and the shift to electric mobility are building blocks for the energy system decarbonisation, promoted in the broad public particularly through energy community organisations. The goal of this research is to evaluate the investment drivers in solar energy communities with and without private vehicle electrification and its physical impact on the low-voltage distribution grid. The community investment decision is formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem, and a three-phase unbalanced power flow simulation analyses the impact of various community scenarios on a real Spanish distribution grid. The PV panel placement and sizing is driven by the minimal possible load-generation mismatch and the feed-in remuneration. Hence, accounting for electric vehicle distribution and charging strategies in the community planning phase affects the cost-optimal layout of PV systems. Going from uncontrolled electric vehicle charging with maximum power to a uniform charging strategy increases the viability in PV investments while significantly reducing the occurrence of excessive voltage drops. The occurrence of overvoltage from distributed solar generation more than doubles from 4.9% to 10.6% when increasing the PV penetration in the energy community by only 9% with an unfavourable panel distribution. Increasing the PV penetration by 59% with a more optimal panel allocation yields a comparatively lower occurrence of overvoltage of 10.0% highlighting the need for informed community planning. © 2025",10.1016/j.ecmx.2025.101073,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ecmx.2025.101073,16,high

This paper presents a data-driven planning framework applied to Cairo, integrating. K-Means spatial clustering, district-level demographic projections (2020–2025), and national electricity load analysis to optimize the siting of vehicle charging stations. A total of 85 public EV stations comprising 209 sockets were georeferenced and analyzed. Two novel indices were introduced to assess infrastructure equity: the socket per density index and the socket travel burden index. Results show that while central business districts are over-served, high-density residential areas such as Ain Shams and Dar Al Salam suffer from significant under-provision. Type 2 connectors dominate the network (77.5 %), leading to functional exclusion for users of CHAdeMO, CCS2, and GB/T vehicles.

A hybrid optimization framework is introduced, combining Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming with a reformulated MILP structure to jointly size photovoltaic systems, battery storage, staged network upgrades, and the dynamic participation of electric vehicles as both load and distributed storage. Thousands of EV constraints are consolidated through a polytope-based approach, and reinforcement costs are captured using a piece-wise linear model tailored to feeder capacity increments. Application to the Tuwaiq Smart City network, covering 3780 households, employs one-minute resolution data for 2024 to benchmark five operational schemes: No Flexibility, Demand Response, Smart Charging, Vehicle-to-Grid, and Integrated Decentralised Energy Management (IDEM). Compared with the baseline, IDEM achieves a 43.8 % reduction in annualised system cost, 46 % decrease in peak imports, and capacity cuts of 75 % and 82 % for PV and storage respectively, alongside a 65 % drop in grid integration expenses.

maybe,,"A three-level model for integration of smart homes, electric vehicle charging stations and hydrogen fuelling stations in reconfigurable microgrids considering vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology","Smart consumers and prosumers play a key role in the modern power and energy systems; due to significant share of self-consumption, they may reduce the burden on local distribution systems or microgrids; moreover, as a large share of their demand is supplied by their own renewable energy resources, they considerably contribute to the decarbonization targets. Identifying the impact of smart prosumers on microgrids may assist decision makers to find the challenges and make suitable changes. The operation of reconfigurable microgrids with high penetration of green smart homes (SHs), charging stations (CSs) and hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) has not been addressed in the literature, so, this paper aims to propose a framework for energy management in the mentioned smart consumers/prosumers and investigate their impact on host microgrids. In the proposed framework, firstly, all electric vehicles (EVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) optimize their own charging schedule using the price signals received through vehicle-to-infrastructure technology; in the second level, each HFS, CS or SH solves its own energy management model and in the third level, the operator of the microgrid solves its day-ahead operational planning model. The solvers of General Algebraic modeling Systems (GAMS) are used to solve all the mentioned models. The results confirm the efficiency of the developed multi-level methodology; according to the results, the studied microgrid enjoys a daily profit of $571.47, meaning that the revenue, earned by selling electricity to CSs, SHs, HFSs and its own demands is considerably higher than sum of the cost of its micro-turbines and the cost of purchased electricity from upstream grid. The results indicate that the batteries decrease the daily cost of smart homes by 4 %; moreover, the results suggest that batteries cause drastic change in operation cost of the microgrid. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2024.134330,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2024.134330,16,high
maybe,,A two-layer optimization model for electric vehicle charging station distribution using a custom genetic algorithm: Application to Montenegro,"To minimize the negative impact of internal combustion vehicles, it is necessary to develop the supporting infrastructure and facilitate the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. A key aspect of this transition is the strategic planning and optimization of the locations of electric vehicle charging stations. The distribution of charging stations is influenced by various factors, including drivers habits, population density, road infrastructure etc. This paper aims to determine the optimal geographical locations and capacities of electric vehicle charging stations by balancing these factors along with budget constraints. A two-stage optimization algorithm is developed using graph-modeled data. The first stage focuses on preliminary planning, considering consumer satisfaction, traffic, electrical grid infrastructure, and construction costs. The second stage refines the optimization using simulation-generated statistics, including waiting times, system utilization and charging stations availability. Novel custom mutation and crossover operations are introduced in the genetic algorithm to enhance the optimization process. Proposed modified genetic algorithm outperforms the standard genetic algorithm by providing solutions that improve the utilization rate while simultaneously enhancing user satisfaction. Notably, the genetic algorithm modification introduced here is not limited to electric vehicle charging station optimization; it can be applied to any problem requiring the optimization of spatial distribution. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2025.136611,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2025.136611,16,high
maybe,,Estimating the seasonal variation in electricity demand of future electric vehicle fleets,"Large-scale uptake of electric vehicles will contribute to emission reductions but may also challenge future highly-renewable electricity grids. Daily variation in charging demand can be synchronized with renewable supply and moved out of grid congestion periods using a range of storage and demand shifting technologies. However, seasonal variation in charging demand, which could add to increasingly-electrified building space-heating demand, is potentially much more difficult to resolve. We develop a statistical model of monthly vehicle energy intensity (Wh/km) based on a citizen-science sourced dataset of multi-year charging data from >1000 vehicles. The model depends on electric vehicle model type, heating and cooling degree day, and location, and can be used to predict seasonal variation in vehicle energy intensity in any climate zone given a distribution of vehicle models. We use the model to explore the seasonal variation in electricity demand from future large scale electric vehicle uptake in New Zealand. We find that electricity consumption for vehicle charging can vary seasonally by up to 16% in some regions and increase winter monthly consumption by up to 30%. These results have implications for future electricity infrastructure planning. The major uncertainties in these projections stem from the difficulty in estimating the energy intensity of the electric vehicle models that will make up the future fleet. © 2025",10.1016/j.energy.2025.137089,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2025.137089,16,high
maybe,,A novel hybrid Salp Swarm Kepler optimization for optimal sizing and energy management of renewable microgrids with EV integration,"The rapid proliferation of renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) has introduced significant challenges in the optimal design and energy management of modern microgrids. This study presents a novel hybrid metaheuristic, the Salp Swarm–Kepler Optimization Algorithm (SSAKOA), which synergistically combines the global exploration capability of the Salp Swarm Algorithm with the orbital-based exploitation efficiency of the Kepler Optimization Algorithm. The proposed algorithm is first rigorously evaluated on a suite of 23 standard benchmark functions to validate its convergence behavior, robustness, and solution quality relative to established metaheuristics. Subsequently, SSAKOA is applied to a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system comprising photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, battery storage, hydrogen subsystems (electrolyzers, hydrogen tanks, and PEM fuel cells), and bidirectional EV charging capabilities. The microgrid model incorporates realistic meteorological, demand, and tariff data over an annual cycle to simulate real-world conditions. Comparative results against nine state-of-the-art optimization algorithms demonstrate SSAKOA's superiority in minimizing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), enhancing the renewable energy fraction (REF), reducing grid dependency, and significantly lowering CO<inf>2</inf> emissions.

maybe,,Assessment of vehicle-grid integration profitability subject to real-world driver behavior and electricity tariff,"The growing adoption of battery electric vehicles creates a need for optimized charging strategies that manage energy demand and charging costs. This study uses a dataset of 49,693 parking events and 11,271 charging sessions, which are collected from 50 vehicles, to investigate the impact of potential charging sessions on optimal VGI charging strategies within different utility territories in the United States, each with distinct pricing mechanisms. Our cost-benefit analysis shows that drivers can save between $3000 and $5000 annually in high-electricity price territories, while in low-price territories, savings can reach up to $400. However, if drivers keep their current charging behavior, they can save between $1500 and $3000 annually in high-price territories and around $200 in low-price territories. Beyond financial benefits, optimal strategies reduce emissions by shifting charging sessions to hours with more renewable generation, which reduces CO<inf>2eq</inf> by up to 2 tonnes per vehicle each year on average. These results demonstrate the importance of potential charging behavior and pricing structures to maximize economic benefits. Our findings suggest that policy measures are necessary to support such programs.

maybe,,"Strategic optimization of electric vehicles' battery swapping stations for developing countries: Balancing demand, cost dynamics, and sustainability in electric mobility","This study presents a stochastic planning framework for battery swapping station (BSS) networks tailored to developing countries. The mixed-integer model co-optimizes siting and operations for interconnected stations while capturing uncertainties in electric vehicle (EV) arrivals, energy prices, electrical load, and degradation cost. A 24-h scenario study on the IEEE 33-bus feeder uses a normalized probability distribution function (NPDF) and retains the 10 most-probable scenarios. Location matters: placing a single station near the source (Bus 1) yields a total network cost $11,886.61, whereas installing at Bus 33 increases the cost to $12,065.92 but raises operator profit from $8111.82 to $8753.89 via fewer discharge cycles. With one station (Bus 2), energy arbitrage injects 7.5 MW and 5.3 MW at peak hours 15–16. Splitting capacity across two stations (Buses 2 and 10) improves service: Station 10 charged 700 batteries and served 222 EVs, while Station 2 exchanged 9.975 MW with the grid. Under uncertainty, purchased power rises modestly; total network cost increases from $11,894.13 to $11,912.09, while profit grows to $8156.62.

maybe,,Pathways to decarbonise the power sector in Mauritius,"An electricity modelling study is presented to support the decarbonisation of the power sector in Mauritius. The gaps in literature that this study aims to address are the insufficient evidence of systematic modelling in the country’s electricity transition strategies, outdated targets in existing modelling studies, limited long-term climate ambitions and the under-representation of the impact of vehicle electrification on electricity planning. Hence, a techno-economic optimisation model is developed to explore three long-term (2025–2050) scenarios in the power sector of Mauritius. Scenario A reflects the current policy ambition, aligning with the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets of achieving 60 % of renewable energy in the electricity by 2030. Scenario B models a pathway to achieve net-zero emissions in the power sector by 2050 and scenario C builds on Scenario B by incorporating widespread electrification of the transport sector. The potential of switching heavy fuel oils with alternative liquid fuels is also explored in all scenarios. The modelling is conducted using a mixed-integer linear programming optimisation tool, the DECarbonisation Options Optimisation (DECO2). Results indicate that carbon emissions drop by almost 50 % if coal is replaced with biomass. Furthermore, a 100 % renewable energy grid is achievable with alternative liquid fuels generating around 1200 to 1500 GWh of electricity. In the case of net-zero emissions, 28 % of electricity can still be produced using fuel oils only if negative emission technologies (NETs) are deployed. Additionally, the electrification of transport is found to have significantly affected the electricity generation capacity. While the modelled system can meet a demand from electric vehicles of up to 400 GWh per year by the year 2050, the flexibility of choosing between the technologies reduces and expensive generation options need to be deployed.

maybe,,Technical and economic sizing of custom electric vehicles with mobile electricity storage facilities for the provision of energy services in urban areas,"Nowadays, one of the most popular trends in the energy transition is the use of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in order to improve the energy efficiency and reliability of renewable energy sources (RES), while increasing energy security. However, it should be remembered that in highly urbanized environments, it is not always possible to install them in sites, mainly for fire safety reasons. As an alternative solution, the supply of electricity through mobile electricity storage facilities (MESF) can be used. Therefore, this article proposes the concept of custom electric vehicles (CEV) carrying additional battery packs with specified capacities. CEVs were divided into three categories, depending on the size of such a vehicle. In the main part of the research, optimization of the capacity of batteries acting as MESF was performed, taking into account constraints related to the vehicle's payload, the cost of batteries and the feasibility of energy services. These services were provided for a designated urban area, in which CEVs provided backup power supply services and optimization of the self-consumption rate. The results indicate that CEVs with a battery capacity of about 100 kWh should be built for vehicles with a payload of up to 700 kg. For vehicles with a payload of up to 1000 kg and a gross vehicle weight of no more than 3.5 t, mobile energy storage facilities will have a capacity of about 150 kWh, while for heavy-duty vehicles the results indicate the installation of MESFs with a capacity of 800 kWh. A major limitation, however, proved to be the cost of batteries for MESFs, which is assumed not to exceed the cost of purchasing a vehicle. Taking into account the aforementioned capacities, it is possible to provide enough electricity to partially balance urban consumers using CEVs with additional battery packs. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.est.2024.114909,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2024.114909,16,high
maybe,,Low-carbon routing and charging planning for electric freight trucks utilizing local surplus solar power,"The decarbonization of freight transport via electric vehicles (EVs) is hampered not only by operational constraints but also by the CO<inf>2</inf> emission factor of charging electricity. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a novel Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) framework that strategically absorbs local, spatiotemporally variable surplus photovoltaic (PV) power, based on transport-side access to surplus information. Unlike prior studies that passively assume the availability of renewable energy, our approach enables delivery operators to proactively adjust both the timing and location of charging in response to surplus forecasts, thereby optimizing charging behavior accordingly. Our primary innovation is a mixed-integer programming model with an objective function that directly minimizes CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by distinguishing between carbon-intensive grid power and low-carbon surplus PV based on smart metering data. The model optimizes delivery routes and en-route charging schedules by integrating day-ahead forecasts of regional surplus power. Through a data-driven case study in Utsunomiya, Japan, our method demonstrated a 16.6 % average reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from charging compared to conventional depot-only charging strategies. In high-surplus scenarios, reductions exceeded 60 %. Crucially, these reductions were achieved while satisfying delivery time window constraints and maintaining efficient routing in terms of total delivery time and travel distance. Our findings illustrate that commercial EV fleets can be leveraged as mobile assets to support local energy sustainability, providing a viable pathway to simultaneously decarbonize logistics and enhance grid stability. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.est.2025.117626,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2025.117626,16,high

Achieving accurate LTLF is not only crucial for grid planning and operation but also provides a scientific foundation for power dispatch, ensuring efficient energy use and maintaining supply–demand balance. However, the nonlinearity, periodicity, and temporality of load pose multiple challenges to LTLF. In this paper, a long-term load forecasting model based on a decomposable multi-period mixing algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the features that may affect load are analyzed and selected. Secondly, by combining load decomposition methods with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) structure, a long-term point forecasting approach based on a decomposable multi-period mixing algorithm is proposed. Thirdly, a probabilistic forecasting method is proposed on the basis of this model.

maybe,,Sizing of energy storage systems for connection power reduction and power smoothing of electric vehicle charging plazas,"The increasing number and charging power of electric vehicles might cause severe troubles for electrical grids motivating a need for investments in grid upgrades. The issues caused by high and intermittent energy demand of electric vehicle charging plazas can be solved with energy storage systems. This article covers sizing of stationary energy storage systems for electric vehicle charging plazas. Energy storage systems are sized to constrain the highest amount of power that the charging plaza takes from the grid below a particular power limit and restrict the rate of change in the grid power draw below a particular ramp rate limit. This is the first study concerning sizing of energy storage systems to smooth variations in the power that the charging plazas take from the grid. The power limit was altered from 10% to 100% and the ramp rate limit from 1 to 25 %/min in relation to the rated charging power of the charging plaza. This study was based on two years of measurement data compiled from eight direct current fast charging stations located in southern California, USA. The results show that the power and energy capacity requirements for an energy storage system used solely for reducing grid connection power below 50% increase only a little if the same energy storage system is used simultaneously also for reducing the rate of change in the grid power draw to comply with a ramp rate limit of 5 %/min or higher. However, use of the energy storage system for both purposes simultaneously increased the share of total electric vehicle charging energy that ran through the energy storage system increasing the degradation of the energy storage system. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.ijepes.2025.111347,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2025.111347,16,high

To this purpose, the electrification of delivery fleets and the adoption of smart warehouses equipped with Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) represent the main solutions. Current research often treats the logistics and warehouse task scheduling aspects and the energy management of warehouses and charging infrastructres for Electric Vehicles (EVs) as separate challenges, leaving a gap in solutions that capture the interdependence of logistics and energy flows. To fill this gap, the present paper proposes a comprehensive Energy Management System (EMS) that couples logistic task planning with energy optimization through a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The proposed EMS coordinates a warehouse equipped with a Photovoltaic (PV) power plant, a BESS, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)-enabled EVs and a fleet of Automated Forklifts (AFs) minimizing, on the energy side, the electricity costs of the warehouse and, on the logistics side, the penalties related to unexecuted tasks. Dedicated task scheduling constraints are included in the EMS. Three operational scenarios are analyzed: (I) both the BESS and V2G-enabled EVs are in operation, (II) BESS is out of service but EVs still provide V2G support, and (III) BESS is unavailable and EVs cannot operate in V2G mode. The results demonstrate a 75% reduction in operating costs in Scenario I compared to Scenario III, while a 42% reduction in operating costs is observed when compared to Scenario II. Also, self-consumption increases by 15% in Scenario I with respect to Scenario III, while it increases by 6% in Scenario I with respect to Scenario II.

Specifically, it focuses on optimizing charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles while managing constrained grid capacity. Businesses’ increasing adoption of mid-size to heavy EV fleets has created a significant surge in electricity demand, often exceeding the local grid’s ability to support charging at vehicles’ base locations.

Further, the e-TMS activates the platooning process where CAVs in the EV’s lane shift to the adjacent lanes and dynamically form platoons to create a dedicated lane for the EV. To further optimize the platooning process, an adaptive smart leader selection (ASLS) algorithm is employed to select a leader vehicle spontaneously among the AVs based on the proximity to the EV, communication reliability, and lane position. Radio Detection and Ranging devices aid this platooning process by providing distance and target velocity, which are needed to maintain the required distance between the AVs and ensure safe platoon formation.

Maintaining the PQ parameters of the SGS within the threshold limits is challenging due to the stochastic nature of building LPD and the dynamic behaviors of chiller operations. Furthermore, reactive power compensation with capacitor banks and robust control of DGs with BESs might not be a straightforward solution to improve the PQ parameters due to the nonlinearity of building LPD, the intermittent nature of DG power, and the limited capacity of BESs. In this context, an artificial neural network approach is used to predict the future values of building LPD, DG power, and cooling power demand. The SGS energy sources, converters, and grid connections are modeled at the system level. PQ index models are developed based on PQ parameter threshold limits. A fuzzy-based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy-sharing strategy is developed based on a unique identification index, an energy-sharing index, and DGs' energy supplying, sharing, or buying to and/or from the neighborhood building. The BESs' charging and discharging control strategy is implemented based on the available energy in BESs. Furthermore, a cooling energy demand (CED) reduction strategy is implemented based on the predicted mean voltage and building CED index. Finally, an EMS is implemented for the SGS, which consists of existing and proposed EMS. The existing EMS is the baseline strategy, which provides available DG energy to the building, and deficit energy is supplied from the grid. The proposed EMS is the PQ parameter mitigation strategy, which maintains the PQ parameters within the threshold limits through the fuzzy-based P2P energy-sharing strategy.

maybe,,Optimizing Hydrogen Systems and Demand Response for Enhanced Integration of RES and EVs in Smart Grids,"Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment, DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs.

Meanwhile, wireless charging lanes (WCLs) and solar-powered EVs (SEVs) offer a promising solution by providing wireless and solar charging power while driving. Under this circumstance, addressing the optimal planning of WCLs while considering SEV operations is crucial for facilitating the widespread adoption of EVs. Considering the uncertain solar power harvesting of SEVs, we propose a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for this integrated planning and operation problem. In the first stage, we optimize the deployment of WCLs with budget constraints, and the second stage determines the optimal operation schedules of SEVs under uncertain solar charging power characterized by a moment-based ambiguity set. To address the computational challenges (due to the discrete variables in both stages and the infinite-dimensional optimization in the second stage), we develop two approximation models and an integrated distributed method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real transportation networks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed models and algorithms.

maybe,,Renewable Energy Following Strategy via Quantified Aggregated Heterogeneous Electric Vehicle Flexibility,"The rapid expansion of renewable energy (RE) generation brings environmental and economic benefits. However, the mismatch of the RE generation pattern and load profile introduces the imbalance between energy supply and demand, posing challenges to modern smart grids. While RE generation is inherently less controllable, the emergence of controllable loads, particularly electric vehicles (EVs) with their flexible charging and discharging capabilities, offers a promising solution to dynamically adjust energy consumption to match RE availability. To this end, this paper proposes a RE following mechanism for EV aggregator (EVA), enabling coordinated charging and discharging of EVs. First, we mathematically quantify the aggregated flexibility of EVs using an affine transformation of convex polytopes. This approach improves computational efficiency and accuracy in aggregating individual heterogeneous EV flexibility with different parameters. Then, a RE following mechanism for the EVA is formulated, treating the quantified EV flexibility set as an operating envelope. Two RE following evaluation methods, namely, Euclidean norm and cosine similarity, are used to assess the RE following effectiveness. Finally, we propose a pricing strategy accommodating various charging and parking decisions of EVs based on a combined framework of time-of-use (TOU) pricing and intraday-block pricing (IBP), incentivizing EV participation in RE following. The numerical results show that the proposed RE following mechanism significantly improves RE utilization, leading to an average increase of 62.04% in the RE consumption ratio and a 13.35% boost in average profits compared to the other two cases without RE following strategies.",10.1109/TSG.2025.3580386,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2025.3580386,16,high

To address this gap, this study proposes a novel spatiotemporal path-based traffic assignment model incorporating a time-expanded user equilibrium (UE) mechanism. The model captures the interdependencies between charging and routing modes by accounting for EV users’ decisions on departure times, route selection, and charging options. Furthermore, a robust optimization framework is developed for the planning of highway charging networks, with the objective of maximizing the profits of private investors acting as policy takers.

maybe,,Electric Vehicle Scheduling Model With Strategic Siting and Incentive Pricing Considering Participation Willingness,"This paper investigates the dispatch process of electric vehicles (EVs) when virtual power plants (VPPs) respond to electricity market demand and proposes an EV dispatch model that considers willingness to participate. The model considers the range anxiety and battery aging anxiety of EVs in the response scheduling process, which effectively improves the willingness of EVs to respond to scheduling. The model mainly involves three aspects: charging station siting, determination of EV incentive electricity price and realization of distributed dispatching. First, this paper proposes a three-step weighted mean clustering method to plan charging station siting, which reduces the driving distance of EVs when responding to grid dispatching, thus reducing range anxiety. At the same time, we studied the effect of different modifications in practical applications. Subsequently, we established an incentive price model for EVs to achieve reasonable quantitative compensation for the battery aging problem that occurs during the dispatch process. Finally, we propose a distributed scheduling strategy to improve the willingness of EVs to respond. This study is validated using real-world data from the city of Chicago. The proposed method reduces the average response distance of EVs in Chicago by 0.188 km and increases the participation willingness of EVs by 0.3243.

The construction of fast charging stations (FCSs) is considered as an indispensable part in facilitating the wider adoption of EVs. In this context, this article, for the first time, proposes a planning strategy for FCSs based on an improved dynamic user equilibrium (IDUE) model, with the objective of minimizing the travel cost of the traffic network (TN), operation cost of the electricity network (EN), construction cost of newly built FCSs, and travel failure cost. In contrast to the conventional DUE model, the proposed IDUE model not only considers drivers’ travel cost but also incorporates the carbon emission flow (CEF) model to account for the carbon emission cost of EVs, thereby achieving the environmental benefits of EVs. Additionally, a novel feasible path screening method for EVs is developed in this work to search the feasible path and identify the practical charging behavior of EVs drivers.

In this paper, we propose and construct a three-layer optimization model for determining the size of airport electric infrastructure, which is solved collaboratively at the three levels of strategic, tactical, and operational layers, in order to construct an optimization algorithm to minimize the construction and operation costs of electric infrastructure, and at the same time to ensure that flights are not delayed by the influence of electric power supply.

maybe,,Empirically Informed Multi-Agent Simulation of Distributed Energy Resource Adoption and Grid Overload Dynamics in Energy Communities,"The rapid proliferation of residential electric vehicles (EVs), rooftop photovoltaics (PVs), and behind-the-meter batteries is transforming energy communities while introducing new operational stresses to local distribution grids. Short-duration transformer overloads, often overlooked in conventional hourly or optimization-based planning models, can accelerate asset aging before voltage limits are reached. This study introduces a second-by-second, multi-agent-based simulation (MABS) framework that couples empirically calibrated Distributed Energy Resource (DER) adoption trajectories with real-time-price (RTP)–driven household charging decisions. Using a real 160-household feeder in Denmark (2024–2025), five progressively integrated DER scenarios are evaluated, ranging from EV-only adoption to fully synchronized EV–PV–battery coupling. Results reveal that uncoordinated EV charging under RTP shifts demand to early-morning hours, causing the first transformer overload within four months. PV deployment alone offers limited relief, while adding batteries delays overload onset by 55 days. Only fully coordinated EV–PV–battery adoption postponed the first overload by three months and reduced total overload hours in 2025 by 39%. The core novelty of this work lies in combining empirically grounded adoption behavior, second-level temporal fidelity, and agent-based grid dynamics to expose transient overload mechanisms invisible to coarser models.

maybe,,Techno-Economic Design Analysis of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Powered by Photovoltaic Technology on the Highways of Saudi Arabia,"The globalization of electric vehicle development and production is a significant goal. The availability of charging stations helps to encourage the global transition to electric vehicles, which may lead to a decrease in traditional fuel consumption. Nevertheless, the rise in the number of electric vehicles is accompanied by sustainability issues, such as managing the grid’s electrical demand, building more charging stations, and providing electricity from renewable resources in an efficient and sustainable manner, especially in Saudi Arabia. This work focused on three challenges regarding the installation of fast charging stations (FCSs) for electric vehicles (EVs) on highways. The first challenge is choosing optimal locations on highways to address the range of anxiety of EV drivers. The second challenge is to fuel these FCSs using renewable resources, such as photovoltaic (PV) panels, to make FCSs sustainable. The last challenge is to design FCSs by considering both highway driving behavior and the available renewable energy resources in order to cover charging demand. All of these challenges should be considered while planning the EV charging infrastructure of Saudi highways from both technical and economic perspectives. Thus, using the HOMER® Grid software (version 1.10.1 June 2023), locations on Saudi Arabian highways were selected based on the renewable resources of several roads that support a large number of vehicles traveling on them. These roads were the Makkah to Riyadh, Makkah to Abha, Riyadh to Dammam, Riyadh to NEOM, and Jeddah to NEOM roads. Electric vehicle charging stations with a capacity of 200 kW, 300 kW, and 500 kW were designed on these roads based on their natural renewable resources, which is PV energy. These roads are the most important roads in the Kingdom and witness heavy traffic. An economic study of these stations was carried out in addition to considering their efficiency. This study revealed that the 500 kW station is ideal for charging electric vehicles, with an annual energy production of 3,212,000 kWh. The 300 kW station had better efficiency but higher capital expenses. The 200 kW station could charge 6100 vehicles annually. The three stations on the Makkah to Riyadh, Makkah to Abha, and Riyadh to Dammam roads can charge 65,758 vehicles annually. The total cost of the project was USD 2,786,621, with the 300 kW plant having the highest initial investment, which can be potentially justified due to its higher power output.

The combined forecasting outputs are passed through a data-driven weighting mechanism to generate probabilistic recommendations that identify optimal charging periods, aiming to alleviate grid stress and ensure efficient operation of local charging infrastructure.

The proposed framework integrates a hybrid optimisation engine—combining genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning—with a real-time analytics module to enable adaptive scheduling under uncertainty. It accounts for dynamic electricity pricing, EV mobility patterns, and grid load fluctuations, dynamically reallocating charging demand in response to evolving grid conditions. Unlike existing GA/RL schedulers, this framework uniquely integrates adaptive optimisation with resilient forecasting under incomplete data and lightweight blockchain-inspired cyber-defence, thereby addressing efficiency, accuracy, and security simultaneously. To ensure secure and trustworthy EV–grid communication, a lightweight blockchain-inspired protocol is incorporated, supported by an intrusion detection system (IDS) for cyber-attack mitigation. Empirical evaluation using European smart grid datasets demonstrates a daily peak demand reduction of 9.6% (from 33 kWh to 29.8 kWh), with a 27% decrease in energy delivered at the original peak hour and a redistribution of demand that increases delivery at 19:00 h by nearly 25%. Station utilisation became more balanced, with weekly peak normalised utilisation falling from 1.0 to 0.7. The forecasting module achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.25 kWh and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) below 20% even with up to 25% missing data. Among tested models, CatBoost outperformed LightGBM and XGBoost with an RMSE of 0.853 kWh and (Formula presented.) of 0.416. The IDS achieved 94.1% accuracy, an AUC of 0.97, and detected attacks within 50–300 ms, maintaining over 74% detection accuracy under 50% novel attack scenarios. The optimisation runtime remained below 0.4 s even at five times the nominal dataset scale. Additionally, the study outlines a conceptual extension to support location-based planning of charging infrastructure. This proposes the alignment of infrastructure roll-out with forecasted demand to enhance spatial deployment efficiency. While not implemented in the current framework, this forward-looking integration highlights opportunities for synchronising infrastructure development with dynamic usage patterns.

maybe,,A Framework for Optimal Sizing of Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Considering Uncertainty,"The adoption of heavy-duty electric vehicles (HDEVs) is key to achieving transportation decarbonization. A major component of this transition is the need for new supporting infrastructure: electric charging stations (CSs). HDEV CSs must be planned considering charging requirements, economic constraints, the rollout plan for HDEVs, and local utility grid conditions. Together, these considerations highly differentiate HDEV CS planning from light-duty CS planning. This paper addresses the challenges of HDEV CS planning by presenting a framework for determining the optimal sizing of multiple HDEV CSs using a multi-period expansion model. The framework uses historical data from depots and applies a mixed-approach optimization solver to determine the optimal sizes of two types of CSs: one that relies entirely on power generated by a PV system with local battery storage, and another that relies entirely on utility grid power supply. A two-layer uncertainty model is proposed to account for variations in PV power generation, HDEV arrival/departure times, and charger failures. The multi-period expansion strategy achieves up to a 78% reduction in total annual costs during the first deployment period, compared to fully expanded CSs. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/wevj16060318,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/wevj16060318,16,high
maybe,,Trigger-Based PDCA Framework for Sustainable Grid Integration of Second-Life EV Batteries,"Second-life electric vehicle batteries (SLBs) represent a promising asset for enhancing grid flexibility and advancing circular economy objectives in the power sector. This paper proposes a conceptual trigger-based PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Act) framework for the sustainable grid integration of SLBs, enabling adaptive operational control across diverse application scenarios. The framework combines lifecycle KPI monitoring, degradation and performance tracking, and economic feasibility assessment with trigger-driven dispatch logic. Technical, financial, and environmental indicators are systematically integrated into the four PDCA phases, providing a structured basis for adaptive management. To illustrate applicability, indicative KPI calculations are presented for three representative scenarios (HV Backup, RES Smoothing, and Frequency Regulation). These examples demonstrate how the framework supports scenario-based planning, performance evaluation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches, which typically analyse technical or economic aspects in isolation, the proposed framework introduces a modular, multi-model architecture that aligns operational triggers with long-term sustainability goals. By embedding reuse-oriented strategies into an adaptive PDCA cycle, the study offers a clear and practical methodology for maximising SLB value while minimising degradation and environmental impacts. The framework provides a valuable reference framework for structured SLB deployment, supporting more resilient, cost-effective, and low-carbon energy systems. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/wevj16100584,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/wevj16100584,16,high

This study assesses the readiness of Chiang Mai, Thailand, for EV deployment by integrating qualita-tive interviews with 10 key organizations and quantitative survey data from 400 participants (200 EV users and 200 potential users). Findings indicate that 82% of respondents identified environmental concerns – particularly reducing PM2.5 air pollution – as their top motivation for EV adoption. This was followed by expectations of long-term cost savings (78%) and confidence in EV performance standards (74%). In contrast, 67% of non-users indicated high upfront costs as the primary barrier, 62% reported inadequate access to charging infrastructure in suburban and rural areas, and 58% exhibited limited awareness of EV incentives and policies. Policy evaluation re-vealed critical gaps in the implementation of Thailand’s “30@30” target, including delays in financial incentives and insufficient regional infrastructure planning. To address these challenges, the study recommends targeted financial support for middle-income households, strategic expansion of charging networks in underserved areas, and increased public-private collaboration. The integration of smart grid technologies and renewable energy sources is also proposed to enhance grid efficiency and reduce long-term operational costs. By linking EV adoption to measurable environmental and economic outcomes, this research provides actionable insights for policymakers and a replicable framework for secondary cities in Thailand and comparable global contexts. © 2025, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

This paper presents a data-driven planning framework applied to Cairo, integrating. K-Means spatial clustering, district-level demographic projections (2020–2025), and national electricity load analysis to optimize the siting of vehicle charging stations. A total of 85 public EV stations comprising 209 sockets were georeferenced and analyzed. Two novel indices were introduced to assess infrastructure equity: the socket per density index and the socket travel burden index. Results show that while central business districts are over-served, high-density residential areas such as Ain Shams and Dar Al Salam suffer from significant under-provision. Type 2 connectors dominate the network (77.5 %), leading to functional exclusion for users of CHAdeMO, CCS2, and GB/T vehicles.

Therefore, the adoption of sustainable charging solutions is becoming essential. This study investigates the integration of solar energy into EV charging infrastructure as a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 and 13. Focused on a 7 kW Level 2 charger, the analysis addresses optimal solar system sizing, energy output, economic feasibility, environmental impact, and sensitivity considerations. The proposed system including a 34 kW photovoltaic (PV) array, a 192-unit battery storage system, and an 8 kW inverter delivers consistent performance under real-world conditions, factoring in system losses, seasonal solar variations, and battery efficiency. The PV system generates 62,294 kWh annually, meeting an EV demand of 38,325 kWh/year and yielding a surplus of 31.54 %. The battery storage provides 66.4 hours of autonomy, ensuring energy availability during low solar generation periods. Economically, the system’s net present cost (NPC) is $192,420, with an initial capital cost of $94,800, 60.76 % of which is attributed to battery investments. Battery replacements constitute 97.34 % of total replacement costs, while operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses total $38,567. A salvage value of $12,638 helps reduces overall lifecycle costs. Environmentally, the solar-powered system achieves an 87.5 % reduction in GHG emissions, emitting only 1917 kg CO2/year compared to 15,330 kg CO2/year for grid-based charging.

Thousands of EV constraints are consolidated through a polytope-based approach, and reinforcement costs are captured using a piece-wise linear model tailored to feeder capacity increments. Application to the Tuwaiq Smart City network, covering 3780 households, employs one-minute resolution data for 2024 to benchmark five operational schemes: No Flexibility, Demand Response, Smart Charging, Vehicle-to-Grid, and Integrated Decentralised Energy Management (IDEM).

This study presents a novel hybrid metaheuristic, the Salp Swarm–Kepler Optimization Algorithm (SSAKOA), which synergistically combines the global exploration capability of the Salp Swarm Algorithm with the orbital-based exploitation efficiency of the Kepler Optimization Algorithm. The proposed algorithm is first rigorously evaluated on a suite of 23 standard benchmark functions to validate its convergence behavior, robustness, and solution quality relative to established metaheuristics. Subsequently, SSAKOA is applied to a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system comprising photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, battery storage, hydrogen subsystems (electrolyzers, hydrogen tanks, and PEM fuel cells), and bidirectional EV charging capabilities. The microgrid model incorporates realistic meteorological, demand, and tariff data over an annual cycle to simulate real-world conditions. Comparative results against nine state-of-the-art optimization algorithms demonstrate SSAKOA's superiority in minimizing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), enhancing the renewable energy fraction (REF), reducing grid dependency, and significantly lowering CO2 emissions.

maybe,,Technical and economic sizing of custom electric vehicles with mobile electricity storage facilities for the provision of energy services in urban areas,"Nowadays, one of the most popular trends in the energy transition is the use of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in order to improve the energy efficiency and reliability of renewable energy sources (RES), while increasing energy security. However, it should be remembered that in highly urbanized environments, it is not always possible to install them in sites, mainly for fire safety reasons. As an alternative solution, the supply of electricity through mobile electricity storage facilities (MESF) can be used. Therefore, this article proposes the concept of custom electric vehicles (CEV) carrying additional battery packs with specified capacities. CEVs were divided into three categories, depending on the size of such a vehicle. In the main part of the research, optimization of the capacity of batteries acting as MESF was performed, taking into account constraints related to the vehicle's payload, the cost of batteries and the feasibility of energy services. These services were provided for a designated urban area, in which CEVs provided backup power supply services and optimization of the self-consumption rate. The results indicate that CEVs with a battery capacity of about 100 kWh should be built for vehicles with a payload of up to 700 kg. For vehicles with a payload of up to 1000 kg and a gross vehicle weight of no more than 3.5 t, mobile energy storage facilities will have a capacity of about 150 kWh, while for heavy-duty vehicles the results indicate the installation of MESFs with a capacity of 800 kWh. A major limitation, however, proved to be the cost of batteries for MESFs, which is assumed not to exceed the cost of purchasing a vehicle. Taking into account the aforementioned capacities, it is possible to provide enough electricity to partially balance urban consumers using CEVs with additional battery packs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2024.114909,2025,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2024.114909,16,high

Achieving accurate LTLF is not only crucial for grid planning and operation but also provides a scientific foundation for power dispatch, ensuring efficient energy use and maintaining supply–demand balance. However, the nonlinearity, periodicity, and temporality of load pose multiple challenges to LTLF. In this paper, a long-term load forecasting model based on a decomposable multi-period mixing algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the features that may affect load are analyzed and selected. Secondly, by combining load decomposition methods with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) structure, a long-term point forecasting approach based on a decomposable multi-period mixing algorithm is proposed. Thirdly, a probabilistic forecasting method is proposed on the basis of this model. This method utilizes a residual simulation technique to quantify the uncertainty of LTLF, effectively complementing the point forecasting results.

This exacerbates the difficulty of congestion management of microgrids in comparison with conventional power systems. In addition to intermittent generation of renewable resources, some other factors such as load forecasting errors and forced outage of generating units can lead to real-time congestion (RTC) in a microgrid. To implement real-time congestion management (RTCM), some approaches can be employed by the microgrid central controller (MGCC) including network reconfiguration using remote control switches, generation and up-grid power rescheduling and load shedding. In this paper, a two-stage programming model is proposed to find the optimal solution of RCTM under different temperature conditions. Therefore, following an unexpected condition and the occurrence of congestion, at the first stage, MGCC implements reconfiguration as the lowest-cost approach to mitigate RTC. Soccer league algorithm is employed in first stage to find the optimal network topology. Subsequently, based on the obtained results from the first stage, a programming model is applied at the second stage to completely eliminate the RTC. The proposed model minimizes a weighted objective function which includes the generation and up-grid rescheduling cost, load shedding cost and congestion clearing time. To improve the operational planning in unexpected conditions, the allowable congestion clearing time is determined based on multi-level thermal rate due to temperature conditions.

The solar electric vehicle is the modern trend technology and enhance the reliability of transportation system. The battery electric vehicle suffers from limited drive range and longer charging duration. The solar cells used in this vehicle not only propel the vehicle but also recharge the onboard batteries. Moreover, the use of solar cells reduces the sizing of batteries hence, the weight and cost of the vehicle also reduced. In this research work the solar-battery hybrid energy source is used and controlled with a microcontroller. The proposed system increases the effective utilization of solar cells and reduces the battery power. Hence, the battery only provides electric power when the motor demand is greater than the solar panel capacity.

maybe,,Grid Scheduling Strategy Considering Electric Vehicles Participating in Multi-microgrid Interaction,"With the expansion of the scale of power grid and the increase of the number of microgrids, the energy interaction between microgrids using contact lines will greatly increase the computation of the superior dispatching center. Therefore, the contact lines between microgrids are cancelled, so that the microgrids can realize energy interaction through the distribution network. However, this method may lead to overload of distribution network connections while reducing the computation. Due to its good transfer characteristics, the addition of electric vehicles (EVs) can alleviate the contact line pressure and realize the load transfer of microgrids. On this basis, a grid dispatching model based on the participation of EVs in microgrid interaction is proposed. Contact lines between microgrids are replaced by EVs and 100\% transmission through the distribution network. The grid load is optimized with the goal of minimizing total cost, maximizing renewable energy utilization, and maximizing profit of each integrator. In the process of model optimization, aiming at the problem that the speed factor in the particle swarm optimization algorithm cannot take into account the optimal direction and the optimal step size, the adaptive time factor is added to establish a two-layer improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, which realizes the cooperative optimization of load and electricity price.

maybe,,e-Carsharing siting and sizing DLMP-based under demand uncertainty,"Electric vehicle (EV) sales and shared mobility are increasing worldwide. Despite its challenges, e-carsharing has an opportunity to still profit in periods of low rental demand compared to traditional carsharing. The purpose of this paper is to assess the profitability of an e–carsharing company based on distribution local marginal price (DLMP) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) that cooperates with the distribution system operator (DSO) through a two-stage stochastic model. The AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) is modeled using second-order cone programming (SOCP) linearized by the global polyhedral approximation. The IEEE 33 bus test system and a real Kernel distribution for the EV rental demands are used in four planning cases in the GAMS environment. The results indicate that the proposed methodology does not affect EV user satisfaction. Moreover, the planning disregarding the power grid perspective is the most profitable, but the operation may not be possible in real applications due to the high-power flows via V2G. Finally, the e–carsharing planning considering the DSO perspective increased the charging cost by 1.66 % but also reduced the DLMP peak, losses, and peak demand by 2.5 %, 1.5 %, and 5.1 %, respectively. One important conclusion is that the technical benefits brought to the DSO by the e–carsharing company could be turned into services and advantages for both agents, increasing profit and mitigating negative impacts, such as higher operational costs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120347,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120347,16,high

Operating a mobile charging service system involves scheduling mobile charging vehicles (MCVs) and batteries owned by the mobile charging service operator (MCSO), which is important to improve its economic efficiency and has a nonnegligible impact on the power system. In this paper, a bilevel optimization framework for logistics and electricity is developed for MCSOs to achieve joint optimization of planning and operation of the mobile charging service system. For transportation logistics, the upper level plans the size of the MCV fleet and routes MCVs in the dynamic traffic network, which can accommodate dynamic changes in the traffic network and make a reasonable route arrangement. For battery energy management, the lower level plans the battery number and optimizes battery charging and discharging at energy service stations, which can track the electric quantity and the state of each battery during the whole process and accurately describe the matching relationship between batteries in a battery swapping scenario. The upper and lower levels are coupled through the battery swapping behavior between MCVs and energy service stations. Through the iteration and adjustment of the two levels, the results optimize the MCSO's total net profit as much as possible and provide assistance to the power system using service capacity margins.

maybe,,Stochastic user equilibrium based spatial-temporal distribution prediction of electric vehicle charging load,"As the number of electric vehicles (EVs) connected to the grid increases, the EV electricity demand rises dramatically, affecting the grid's planning and operation and deepening the coupling of the power and transportation systems. Therefore, accurate spatial–temporal distribution prediction of EV charging load is vital for both power system and coupled power-transportation system studies. This paper proposes a novel method based on stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) for predicting the accurate spatial–temporal distribution of EV charging load synchronized with traffic states. A prediction framework of EV charging load based on SUE and trip chain is proposed, which can effectively reflect the actual behavior of EVs in synchronous traffic states. Then, the extended logit-based SUE and equivalent mathematical model are proposed to obtain more detailed traffic states with intersection turning flows and delays. Meanwhile, the unified reachability and charging models are established to ensure that the trip chain is reachable and the charging characteristics are suitable for different EV types. Finally, the method of the successive averages (MSA) and the Dijkstra-based K-shortest paths algorithms are integrated to solve the proposed framework iteratively with stable convergence. Test results on a realistic traffic network show that the proposed method can effectively reflect the charging and trip characteristics of different EV types while ensuring reachability. And it can also accurately predict the overall and individual EV travel costs and total charging loads in detailed synchronous traffic states. In particular, even in the case of high EV penetration with higher peak-to-valley differences and charging demand, the convergence of the prediction is still stable with even more remarkable prediction effectiveness, especially during peak load hours. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis based on proposed criticality indexes reveals that traffic network failures will affect the network-wide traffic states and EV charging loads with different node-level impact characteristics, which should be considered in joint power-transportation restoration scheduling. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120943,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120943,16,high

Furthermore, exploiting emerging data from distribution networks to provide decision support for adapting planning and operational strategies with system transitions presents a challenge. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel application of digital twins based reinforcement learning to improve decision making by a distribution system operator, with key metrics of predictability, responsiveness, interoperability, and automation. The power system states, i.e., network configurations, technological combinations, and load patterns, are captured via a convolutional neural network, chosen for its pattern recognition capability with high-dimensional inputs. The convolutional neural networks are iteratively trained through the fitted Q-iteration algorithm, as a batch mode reinforcement learning, to adapt the planning and operational decisions with the dynamic system transitions. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by reducing 50% of the investment cost when the system transitions towards the winter and maintaining the power loss and loss of load within 5% compared to the benchmark optimisation. Doubled power consumption was observed in winter under future energy scenarios due to the electrification of heat. The trained model can accurately adapt optimal decisions according to the system changes while reducing the computational time of solving optimisation problems, for a range of scales of distribution systems, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment by a system operator. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121128,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121128,16,high

However, integrating the XFCS with a high-capacity power converter into the power distribution network (PDN) is difficult and uneconomical due to the restrictions regarding urban planning and high investment in PDN expansion. Considering the fluctuation in the EV charging demand and the limited capacity of the power converter, a collaborative policy for real-time EV charging power allocation and BES discharging power control is proposed based on Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is solved by the constraint deep deterministic policy gradient (CDDPG). The proposed model makes it possible to integrate the XFCS with reduced capacity power converter into the PDN with a minimal negative impact on the quality of service (QoS) of EV owners. Finally, the experimental evaluation with real-word data sets demonstrates that the proposed approach is more effective than benchmark methods in dynamically allocating charging power for XFCS. © 2023",10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121497,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121497,16,high

However, a continuous increase in the penetration of such elements would bring more complexities to the distribution network. Accordingly, this paper presents a unified planning model comprising renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG), ESS, and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). In this regard, a Latin Hypercube Sampling method is utilized to generate multi-scenario for describing the uncertainty of renewable energy and load demand. The stochastic EV charging behaviors are represented by various probability density functions (PDF). In addition, an exploitable capacity loss of ESS and EV batteries is calculated by the battery degradation model based on the depth of discharge (DOD). Furthermore, the battery degradation cost is incorporated into the objective of the planning model to identify the optimal decision for candidate assets. A piecewise linearization approach is introduced to convert the problem into a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Numerical results demonstrate that the exploitable capacity loss of batteries plays a key role in asset planning and provides potential contributions to the optimal decisions of the distribution network.

Hence, this article introduces a tri-stage mechanism for the joint management of the energy and ancillary services markets in coordinated TN and DN, taking into account wind and solar renewable resources, SHs and EVs. In the first stage of this mechanism, SHs do their daily planning with the possibility of participating in the regulation market and send it to the DN operator. In the second stage, DN operator determines its strategy for participation in the energy and ancillary services markets according to the programs received from SHs and sends it to the TN operator. Finally, in the third stage, the TN operator settles the markets according to the plans received from the DN operators. This model is designed in the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) format and simulated using CPLEX solver in GAMS. The simulation outputs illustrate that SHs by controlling their internet-of-things (IoT)-based appliances and EVs have provided cheap services in the regulation market and subsequently reduced the costs of this market by 10.4%.

Our analysis is based on developing: (a) multiple demand scenarios produced from a bottom-up forecasting model with high temporal resolution that capture structural changes in electricity consumption resulting from (AC) and electric vehicle (EV) adoption, and (b) a multi-period power system capacity expansion model with high temporal resolution of grid operations to model supply-side evolution in response to changes in demand and technology and policy factors. Such a framework allows us to, for example, quantify the impacts of improving appliance efficiency standards for AC systems or shifts in EV charging patterns on power system decarbonization prospects. Under projected renewables and Li-ion storage cost declines, our modeling points to solar and wind generation contributing substantially (46–67%) to meet annual electricity demand in India by 2030. However, without appropriate policy measures to phase out existing coal generation, even such rapid adoption of variable renewable energy coupled with one or more technological levers such as low-cost energy storage and demand-side measures such as setting aggressive AC efficiency standards and deploying distribution level storage, are insufficient to reduce annual CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in 2050 vs. 2020 because of the relatively higher growth rate of projected electricity demand over this period. This suggests that deep decarbonization of India's power sector will require policy measures beyond efforts related to accelerating renewables deployment. © 2023",10.1016/j.egycc.2023.100098,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egycc.2023.100098,16,high

Different factors affecting EV user, distribution network and CS operation must be taken into account when selecting CS locations and capacity. The purpose of this study is to design a FCS location and capacity planning framework that considers EV user travel time and waiting time, distribution network power loss, and station utilization aspects. Besides, a prior utilization rate-based queuing algorithm is proposed to determine the CS capacity, which simultaneously reduce user waiting time and affirms adequate station utilization.

The impact of EVs cannot be decoupled from the power generation. Therefore, in this study, New Zealand's energy system (transport and national power generation) is modelled in LEAP and the impacts of a 40% transition to EVs assessed with a multiple-scenario 2019-based retro-analysis. Two charging scenarios are simulated, modelling “Optimistic” and “Concentrated” charging. Two methods of generation expansion are modelled: “Mixed Renewables” and “Non-Renewables”. Results show existing generation can support a 16% EV transition with Concentrated charging, and a 43% transition with Optimistic charging, without decreasing the reserve margin. It is expected a 40% EV transition with a Non-Renewable power system expansion will reduce energy sector GHG emissions by 2% and costs by 7%, and a Mixed Renewables expansion will reduce emissions by 17%–18% and costs by 4%–5%. These results suggest an EV transition is an effective method for New Zealand to meet GHG emission targets, particularly with renewable generation expansion.

At its core, electrification relies on integrating insights that span the supply and demand side of power systems, resolving operational characteristics and long-term climate change, and the integration of previously independent engineered systems. However, our modeling landscape consists of a suite of models that focus on distinct sectors (power, buildings, transport) and spatial–temporal scales (municipal, provincial, federal). This paper probes whether the existing suite of energy system models, which span sectors, disciplines, and jurisdictions, is up to the task of charting net-zero pathways, specifically in the Canadian context. To do so, we analyze an inventory of energy system models that are being used in practice using a recently assembled model database. Next, we supplement our analysis with a web-based search and literature review. For each model category, we describe the key modeling approaches, strengths and weaknesses, and typical ways and areas in which these models are applied. We find that by focusing on a specific scale and sector, these models by their very definition, omit out-of-scope interactions leaving critical information gaps. Many of the most imperative areas for future research straddle multiple sectors or multiple scales—electric vehicle charging, carbon policy coordination, regional electricity trading, to name a few. Future research should focus on identifying ways in which different models could be used together to produce policy-related conclusions that are as detailed but more holistic than conclusions that can be gleaned from an individual model. © 2023 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.egyr.2023.02.090,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2023.02.090,16,high
maybe,,Optimal deployment of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles considering the sizing of the electrical distribution network and traffic condition,"The conventional vehicle fleet worldwide has contributed to the degradation of air quality due to CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Consequently, it has migrated from internal combustion to electric vehicles (EVs). However, it is essential to ensure the deployment of electric vehicle charging station infrastructures (EVCSI) to guarantee their interoperability for the development of electric mobility. Moreover, the sustainability of EVCSI depends not only on the capacity to meet demand but also on the adequate number of terminals in the different public charging stations (CS) to reduce waiting times for battery recharging. Then to achieve an optimal sizing of charging stations, it is crucial to foresee the maximum number of vehicles that could use the different CS during a time interval. The sizing of CS must respond to real mobility constraints and technical conditions, such as the capacity of vehicular flow, the capacity of the roads according to their geometry, the trajectories marked by the users, and the possible exit of operation of some CS. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem considering four fundamental axes, which are: stochastic analysis of heterogeneous vehicular flow, a solution to the transportation problem with the capacitated multicommodity flow problem and Hungarian algorithm, analysis of the optimal number of terminals considering loading times, and finally the proposed EVCSI will be validated using the CymDist software for electrical engineering. Consequently, the computational complexity of the model is of a combinatorial type and is defined as NP-hard given the multiple variables and constraints within the transportation problem. © 2023 The Authors",10.1016/j.egyr.2023.04.355,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2023.04.355,16,high
maybe,,The impact of electric vehicle charging infrastructure on the energy demand of a city,"With the increased market penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), energy consumption is growing at a quicker rate. Electric vehicles are slowly but surely gaining a foothold in India's rapidly expanding market. With more EVs on the road, there will be more demand for charging and more energy use in some places, which can put a lot of stress on the power grid. In the absence of sufficient planning, there is a risk of power system interruption and failure. Therefore, the need for energy in cities will shift in light of the advent of EVs in the next decade or two. Accordingly, Surat has been chosen as the research region for the planning of charging infrastructure in the current study. After reviewing the literature, primary data was acquired to estimate citizen travel demands. Vehicle registration statistics were compiled from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for the purpose of EV forecasting. After collecting data, the EV population and demand for public charging stations by 2025 and 2030 were calculated. This study aims to meet the public charging demand in the city of Surat by analyzing the electric vehicle growth rate and vehicle forecast. This anticipated data was then utilized to compute the energy demand consumption for Surat city by calculating vehicle kilometers traveled. The demand for public charging comes out to be 42.4 MWh/day in 2025 and 358.05 MWh/day in 2030, respectively.

maybe,,Minimizing the electric vehicle charging stations impact in the distribution networks by simultaneous allocation of DG and DSTATCOM with considering uncertainty in load,"The rise in popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) is attributable to their economical maintenance, excellent performance, and environmentally-friendly nature due to zero carbon emissions. Nevertheless, the increased utilization of EVs poses challenges for the distribution system's efficiency. The strategic placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) is crucial in maintaining the reliability of the radial distribution system (RDS). The improper allocation of EVCS can result in degradation and affect the distribution system. To overcome this issue, a potential solution involves integrating the charging stations with the RDS by utilizing distribution static compensators (DSTATCOMs) and distributed generation (DG) to mitigate the adverse effects of EVCS on the RDS. The appropriate sizing of DG/DSTATCOM depends on variations in load stages, as it impacts the stability of the RDS. Additionally, the uncertainty of distribution loads can lead to an underestimation of power within the system, posing a primary challenge. In this proposed work, two studies were examined: (i) DG and DSTATCOM allocation considering load uncertainty without EVCS impact, and (ii) DG and DSTATCOM allocation considering load uncertainty with EVCS impact. To address this multi-objective problem, an objective function was developed to reduce real power loss while adhering to system equality and inequality constraints. To tackle the challenge, the researchers used the bald eagle search algorithm (BESA), a revolutionary metaheuristic optimization methodology. The efficacy of the proposed approach was validated using two test systems: a 34-bus system and a 118-bus system. The results obtained from these test cases demonstrate that the BESA-based solution is highly exact in reducing real power loss, increasing bus voltage, and enhancing system stability with a significantly high convergence rate. Hence, the proposed approach presents a promising solution for optimizing RDS with multiple objectives. © 2023 The Authors",10.1016/j.egyr.2023.08.035,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2023.08.035,16,high

The battery swapping station (BSS) is transferred seasonally and integrated to different buses in various seasons in order to defer the investment on the new lines. The BSS is as well integrated with rooftop solar panels. The uncertainties of loads and renewable energies are taken into account and handled by stochastic programming. The charging scheduling is optimized for all the batteries inside the BSS. A comparative study is presented for 3 cases including expansion planning without BSS, planning with a fixed location of BSS, and the proposed method (i.e., planning with seasonally transferred BSS). The numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed model transfers the BSS every six months, where, it is installed on bus 25 in seasons 1 and 2, and on bus 17 in seasons 3 and 4. The congested lines such as lines 2 to 19, 16 to 17, and 6 to 7 are expanded by installing new lines in years 2, 4, and 5, respectively. The BSS sends power to the external grid in on-peak loading times such as hours 12 to 15 and 18 to 21.

maybe,,Identifying charging zones to allocate public charging stations for electric vehicles,"In recent years, several techniques have been presented in the specialized literature to identify the best location for installing public charging stations, considering the demand for charging the batteries of electric vehicles that travel along the main roads in urban areas. However, in cities with different travel patterns for electric vehicle drivers, such consideration may result in charging equipment serving few electric vehicles during high recharging demand. Thus, planning by zone can determine more chargers per station with greater utilization during the operation of charging stations. For this, this work presents a methodology that uses the concept of a charging zone, defined as a circular geographic space with charging equipment that will satisfy the charging demand of electric vehicles in their surroundings. Identifying the centroids of these zones is formulated as a p-median problem, solved by the Teitz-Bart algorithm to provide more coverage to the demands for electric charging in large urban areas. The proposed methodology was applied in a Brazilian city with approximately 3 million inhabitants to find the spatial distribution of public charging zones, considering six scenarios of the global penetration of electric vehicles. Furthermore, we compared the allocation of the centroids in these zones with the solution determined by commercial geoprocessing software. This comparison shows that the proposal determines a spatial distribution of 10% more of these zones with a load factor closer to 0.5 than the results of the commercial geoprocessing software. More zones with this load factor value contribute to better use of the power distribution network installations. In addition, the proposed methodology finds an average reduction of 319 kW of peak demand in regions with a low flow of electric vehicles to meet their charging needs in each analyzed scenario. This peak-demand reduction may allow less investment in connecting future charging stations to the power distribution network. Therefore, the proposed methodology can help public and private agents to disseminate electric mobility, finding public charging areas with greater utilization of chargers per station during the operation of charging stations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2023.128436,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2023.128436,16,high

Renewable fluctuations in the supply side and EV charging burden in the demand side propose higher requirements for the system flexibility. Optimized station layout and charging schedule could coordinate the load curve, provide system flexibility and accommodate the variable renewables. However, previous work only focuses on maximizing the profit of station holders and vehicle owners, lacking the consideration of the broader impact on power system. Here, we propose an EV charging station layout optimization methodology considering not only the EV charging behavior, sequential charging demand, but also its further impact on power system. The station layout and charging schedule are co-optimized with an integrated power system model. Applying the proposed methodology to Jiangxi in 2025, a cumulative charging station capacity of 1412, 1092, and 1415 MW is recommended in workplaces, residences, and shopping centers, respectively.

In view of the coordinated charging of EVs under the photovoltaic (PV) energy connected to the power grid, a collaborative charging control strategy is proposed based on a double deep q-network with Prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER). Specifically, Long–Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is utilized to capture the uncertainties caused by power requirement, PV power, and real-time electricity price. Then, a modified DDQN approach and the corresponding reward function are applied to solve the cooperative charging problem. In addition, the introduction of a PER mechanism based on TD bias sampling in reinforcement learning alleviates the problem of reward sparsity in learning scenarios and improves the training stability and efficiency. The proposed approach can achieve collaborative scheduling of EVs, which helps reduce the charging cost, promote the consumption of PV energy and avoid transformer overload. Simulation case studies based on real data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the charging cost by 30% and increase the PV power utilization by 10% compared to the DDQN algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105642,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105642,16,high

More specifically, the optimal vehicle speed is optimized by a model predictive control algorithm.

Finally, three learning-based energy optimization control strategies, namely Q-learning, deep Q network (DQN), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, are designed under the hierarchical energy optimization control architecture. It is shown that the Q-learning algorithm is able to optimize energy control; however, the agent will meet the ”dimension disaster” once it faces a high-dimensional state space issue. Then, a DQN control strategy is introduced to address the problem. Due to the limitation of the discrete output of DQN, the DDPG algorithm is put forward to achieve continuous action control.

Reducing pollution can be realized through optimal planning of charging and discharging of electric vehicles as consumers and storage of electric energy. Also, vehicles connected to the network increase the reliability of the network during power outages. However, the connection of electric vehicles to the grid can also bring limitations.

Therefore, a new reliability-oriented analysis-based two-stage planning framework for optimal deployment of solar photovoltaic (SPV) powered FCEVS and battery energy storage systems (BESS) in coupled transportation and distribution networks is proposed in this article, while encapsulating the complex interactions between EVs, SPVs, and BESS. A novel composite metric, the average voltage deviation reliability index (AVDRI), has been developed for the deployment of FCEVS infrastructure considering the goals and limitations of both distribution and transportation networks. Models such as the demand for charging electric vehicles, the reliability evaluation system, and the economic analysis model are offered to provide essential inputs for the study of distribution network reliability and profitability. In the first stage, AVDRI, active power loss, captured EV flow, and capital, along with operating and maintenance costs of the FEVCS and SPV system, are all taken into consideration as objectives when optimizing the placement and sizing of SPV assisted FCEVS using Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and a fuzzy satisfaction-based hybrid technique. Then, the optimal resource sizing, such as the count of charging spaces, the capacity of the SPV system at each optimal FCEVS, and captured EV flow, are estimated. In the second step, a bi-section approach is used to compute the capacity of the BESS and the extra SPV rating necessary to power it at each optimal FCEVS location, taking into account the irradiance profile for all conceivable seasons within a planning year. A 25-node transportation network coupled to an IEEE 33 bus distribution system is used to validate the proposed methodology under a range of seasonal scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.est.2023.108814,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2023.108814,16,high
maybe,,Infrastructure planning for airport microgrid integrated with electric aircraft and parking lot electric vehicles,"To achieve net-zero emissions in aviation industry with defined CO<inf>2</inf> mitigation objectives in “Flightpath 2050″, electric propulsion system becomes an attractive technology. Many electric aircraft (EA) prototypes with a fully electrically powered propulsion system for short-haul commuting air transport have been designed in recent years. Planning and designing the ground power systems and associated electric aircraft charging facilities are also essential for realising aviation electrification. In this work, a bi-objective infrastructure planning framework for airport microgrid to accommodate parking lot electric vehicles (EVs) and EA is developed, and the impact of V2G on the airport microgrid is assessed. The dispatching problem of the airport microgrid is formulated as a heuristic optimisation problem, and the NSGA-II algorithm is adopted to find the Pareto Fronts and optimal solutions. There are two different scheduling strategies for charging EA: plug-in charge and battery swap. The economic and technological assessments for both strategies are conducted and compared. The results show that adopting V2G strategy can improve the airport microgrid economic performance. In general, the EA plug-in charge strategy performs better than the EA battery strategy in terms of microgrid resilience, while the EA battery swap strategy can reduce the operation costs of the airport microgrid. © 2023 The Authors",10.1016/j.etran.2023.100257,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.etran.2023.100257,16,high

maybe,,An optimal coordinated planning strategy for distributed energy station based on characteristics of electric vehicle charging behavior under carbon trading mechanism,"Under the dual-carbon goal, the number of electric vehicle (EV) has surged, and the uncertainty of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the load has become prominent, which brings the challenge for higher requirements to the equipment composition of distributed energy station (DES) and performance of station-network. This paper proposes a collaborative planning method for low-carbon DES with networks, which is focusing on the characteristics of EV charging behavior. First of all, based on the quantitative analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of charging load of four typical types of EV, including private vehicle, public vehicle, taxi and bus, the Monte Carlo method is used to construct the charging load modeling of EV in the region area. In addition, the low-carbon DES is modeled equipped with photovoltaic (PV) and power to gas (P2G) devices, and the Prim algorithm is adopted to search for the optimal network layout of energy transmission pipelines in the region area. Under carbon trading mechanism, aiming at the lowest annualized total cost of the regional station-network, a station-network collaborative planning modeling strategy for the capacity allocation of low-carbon DES with networks is established. Finally, the case study for a project in Beijing China is implemented on MATLAB, to prove the effectiveness of the method proposed in the paper. The time-of-use electricity price scheme changes the temporal and spatial characteristics of EV load. For example, more than 2 MW the EV load can be brought into the valley price range, which reduces the carbon transaction cost and energy purchase cost of DES by 50 thousand yuan almost when peak-valley electricity price difference is close to 1.2 yuan. At the same time, the growth of EV charging load(the penetration rate of EV can reach up to 20%) in the planning area has not increased the investment and operation-maintenance costs of DES equipment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijepes.2022.108884,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2022.108884,16,high
maybe,,Electric vehicle entire-trip navigation and charging reservation method based on a high-speed communication network,"Having a large number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road will lead to vehicle congestion, long waiting times at charging stations (CSs), and even the inability to find an available charging position. Main technical challenges in mobile EVs charging may include charging information exchanges between EVs and CSs, EV traveling route and CS selection, and EV charging planning. To solve the above problems, this study provides an optimization solution for entire-trip charging and navigation of EVs, which balances charging resources, protects the travel time of EV drivers, and prioritizes renewable energy. The communication scheme of an EV charging network is designed, including real-time communication between the CSs, EV drivers, road condition monitoring center, power grid company, and the charging control center distributed in every parking lot. CSs in each road segment sort vehicles arriving at stations, allocate charging time slots, provide charging start times, and adjust those times for EVs with reservations that have not yet arrived. EV drivers can plan vehicle charging on their smart devices. The optimization of electric navigation can reduce the travel time or cost for drivers, ensure safe electricity usage, calculate vehicle routes, select CSs, and provide charging time intervals. The effectiveness of the method is verified on a regional road network in China, and the results show that it can balance the charging resource distribution of a CS, guarantee EV state of charge level, greatly reduce travel cost or travel time, provide precise waiting time, and prioritize renewable energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijepes.2023.109070,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2023.109070,16,high
maybe,,Wind curtailment mitigation in presence of battery energy storage and electric vehicle: A comprehensive multi-objective decision-support framework,"Concern to maintain exploitation of power system in secure mode, the wind curtailment (WR) caused by the perpetual fluctuating of wind power (WP) can menace the operational power system schedule. The mentioned phenomenon will intensify by high WP penetration into the power system. In addition, incorporating plugged-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the power system along with the WP intermittent will increase the vagueness rating of the problem. Due to the expansion and development of battery energy storage (BES), the possibility of power shortage compensating and accumulating additional power produced by wind farms (WFs) has been engendered. Providing a stochastic scenario-based structure with different correlation levels can increase the robustness of the model. Here, a two-stage model has been proposed to overcome such a high-dimensioned problem. The first stage determined the scheduled power output of thermal generators (TGs) as the unit commitment (UC) problem to minimize operational costs. Next, by reckoning the supplementary constraints, the scheduled WP, which is re-optimized, will be obtained. The second stage has employed to detect the BES capacity. In this stage, the intelligent parking lots (IPLs) assign price-based signal impetus to the PHEVs to participate in economic dispatch. Due to the prominence of being equipped with the supreme decision-making facility for the intelligent decision-maker operator (IDMO), the augmented epsilon-constraint method has been employed to capture the Pareto sets of some multi-objective functions. The optimum solution has been selected by the decision-making method (DMM) according to the operator's preferences. The results of proposed Multi-Objective Decision-Support (MODS) model show that the total operation cost and BES sizing have dropped by 68 and 6.1 percent, respectively.

maybe,,Optimal sizing and feasibility analysis of second-life battery energy storage systems for community microgrids considering carbon reduction,"The rapid development of distributed renewable energy has made energy storage essential for efficient operation. However, energy storage is challenging for prosumers due to high investment costs and long payback periods. The second use of batteries has been evaluated as an alternative energy storage after the first service in electric vehicles with the remaining 80% capacity. This study investigates the feasibility of using secondary-use batteries as shared storage for prosumers. Financial and technical break-even points regarding the gradually increasing carbon limit on the way to 100% renewable have been determined. The proposed method's performance has been verified by conducting sensitivity analyses regarding various environmental and economic characteristics. The self-consumption rates have been achieved by 65.9% in Spain (Madrid) and 49.9% in England (London), and 48.5% in Türkiye (Antalya) without incentive. Increasing the carbon tax by 1 $/t for high and low energy tariffs can reduce carbon emissions by 181.3 and 1607 kg/yr. The optimum sizes remain until the carbon tax threshold is 60 $/tCO<inf>2</inf>eq for high energy tariffs. After 60 $/tCO<inf>2</inf>eq, it is tended to enlarge the hybrid power system. However, severe carbon emission restriction for zero carbon targets prevents the optimum system design since the carbon reduction cost increases to 232.7–304.8 $/kg.

maybe,,Optimal planning and design of integrated energy systems in a microgrid incorporating electric vehicles and fuel cell system,"In recent decades, as a result of diminishing fossil fuel reserves and rising social concern, electric power systems as one of the largest sectors for environmental emissions, have had no choice but to search for alternatives to alleviate the environmental problems due to conventional generation system. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can cause difficulties in the electrical grid and system operation. To circumvent this issue, an efficacious stochastic optimization model is developed in this paper to enable the control entity to manage generation and storage assets by controlling the charging behavior of PEVs. To achieve the lowest total cost, a new strategy for reducing reliability costs is proposed. In this regard, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) tool is used to reduce the overall system cost. The presented energy management model for the MG in the grid-connected mode takes into consideration the uncertainty of output power of the wind turbine (WT) and the photovoltaic (PV), as well as the PEVs’ charging and discharging. In this study, an innovative and effective optimization algorithm known as the modified fluid search optimization algorithm (MFSO) is utilized to optimize the MG operation problem. The results show that the suggested model incorporating electric vehicles (EVs) can enable MG operation at the minimum cost and reliability. As can be observed, the amount of time required by the presented method to solve the first case problem is 6.64s, which is significantly less than the amount of time required by the other methods. In a similar vein, the MFSO method is noticeably quicker than both GA and PSO when applied to case studies 2 and 3. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.232694,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.232694,16,high
maybe,,Technology balancing for reliable EV uptake in distribution grids: An Australian case study,"The emergence of new technologies, such as photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, household Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and electric vehicles (EVs), has introduced challenges for the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) in the operation of power distribution networks. Uncontrolled renewable energy generation and storage, and EV charging can cause over/under voltage problems. Recently, there has been much effort, from control and scheduling of BESSs and EVs to PV curtailment, to address these issues. However, the knowledge about how much penetration of these technologies can be well-tolerated by the grid when all charging/discharging are uncontrolled, would still be of interest to DNOs. There are many depending factors such as customer consumption profiles, grid conditions and network constraints. In this paper, we propose a framework to determine the critical balance between PV, BESS and EV in a distribution grid. Using real data from 4000 customers in Victoria, Australia, we find that in the absence of advanced control and scheduling algorithms, the best approach to prevent voltage violation in the grid is to keep the installation of PV and BESS balanced with the EV penetration. We also show that power export to the grid by EVs using the vehicle-to-home (V2H) technology may contribute to keeping the grid voltage in the standard range if 40%–80% of EVs are in the discharge mode in critical peak times. While complete coordination of PV, EV and BESS has not yet been fully realized in many networks, our methodology provides a framework for DNOs to perform optimised planning. © 2023",10.1016/j.renene.2023.02.056,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2023.02.056,16,high

According to the presence of uncertain parameters and in order to simulate realistic conditions, a scenario generation/reduction approach is also performed to model the fluctuations of wind speed, solar radiation, electrical loads, incoming vehicles and market price. As well, a time-of-use strategy is implemented to show the impact of flexible loads on objective functions. It is noteworthy that simulations are implemented on a real distribution network with actual geographical data. The results for the proposed model in the deterministic state show an improvement equal to 283.33% for the voltage deviation, while a profit equal to 2.2 million dollars per model lifetime is achieved. The uncertainties deteriorate the voltage deviation by 12.12%, in return, the profit is increased by 8.63%. It is also concluded that responsive loads increase the profit and enhance the voltage deviation by 7.94% and 6.3%, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.scs.2023.104632,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2023.104632,16,high
maybe,,Charging navigation strategy for electric vehicles considering empty-loading ratio and dynamic electricity price,"While electric vehicle users enjoy the convenience of electrified transportation, their random driving characteristics and disorderly charging will cause traffic congestion and aggravate the peak valley difference of power grid load. An electric vehicle charging navigation strategy that takes into account the idle rate and dynamic tariff is proposed in this paper, which improves the load characteristics and reduce traffic congestion. Firstly, the electric vehicle charging navigation model with the integration of “four networks and four flows” is established. The interaction effect between the charging demand of electric vehicle users and the information network, traffic network, power grid is analyzed. Secondly, the multi-dimensional spatial and temporal characteristics of the empty-loading ratio of the electric taxi are studied. The optimal charging period for electric vehicle users is determined by the intelligent charging navigation terminal based on real-time road condition information. The path planning is carried out with the goal of minimizing the comprehensive cost of charging time and dynamic charging cost, and the electric taxi is guided to the optimal charging station to achieve orderly charging in space. Finally, taking the coupling system of traffic network and power grid in an urban area as an example, the proposed strategy is simulated and analyzed. The results show that this strategy can effectively balance the load of each charging station, improve the load characteristics of distribution network, which can effectively divert traffic flow, alleviate traffic congestion, and improve the operating income of electric taxi. © 2022",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100987,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2022.100987,16,high
maybe,,Optimal location of fast charging stations alongside pricing design from distribution company viewpoint considering renewable energy resource: A modified capacitated flow-capturing location model,"Investigating the optimal location of fast charging stations (FCSs) followed by optimizing the electricity sale prices simultaneously for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are considered as critical challenges in a power grid. This paper proposes the improved flow-capturing location model (FCLM) with mix-integer linear programming (MILP), in which the location of FCSs, alongside the electricity sale price to PEVs, is optimized so that the profit of the distribution company (DISCO) is maximized. Also, it considers renewable energy resources (RESs) to support FCSs. DISCO is assumed to be in charge of the cost of stations, the expansion network, RESs, and the electricity purchase from the network. The goal is to determine with how much price DISCO should sell the electricity to PEVs for the return on investment (ROI) rate to be positive at a specified time. Moreover, the PEV owners' non-utilization function is considered in such a way that the electricity sale price to PEVs in stations has a direct relationship with the PEV owners' non-utilization. In addition, the growth of PEVs, electric load, and electricity purchase from the network are considered. The proposed model has been implemented on a 25-node urban traffic network fed by a 33-bus distribution network. The results demonstrate that the investor provides electricity for PEVs with less price in the proposed model because the investment costs of FCSs are reduced by 34.4\%. Also, by raising the PEVs' charging demand, the electricity sale price in the station is reduced. In this condition, the utilization of PEV owners is maximized. Moreover, considering RESs reduces voltage drop and electricity sales price to PEVs.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

maybe,,Optimal allocation of cloud energy storage system in low-voltage distribution network,"In low-voltage distribution networks, an uncontrolled charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) brings about intensive peak loads in distribution transformers’ daily load curves. Due to insulation degradations, this issue ends in transformers’ loss of life (LOL) and early aging. The notion of cloud energy storage system (CESS) with larger power and energy capacities enables consumers to have access to cheaper energy storage facilities. Thanks to CESS installation, semi-smart, controlled, and low-cost charging of PHEVs could be realized to relieve the transformer's peak loads and reduce the peak-to-average (PAR) ratio of load curve. To do so, this paper develops an optimal planning model for siting and sizing of a CESS to accommodate the charge/discharge requirements of consumers who are willing to collaborate with CESS and hence, implementing a controlled charging of PHEVs. The proposed model considers the investment and operation costs of both CESS and distribution network. It also models the transformer LOL costs. The PHEVs, in private garages, are supposed to be connected to the grid through a smart module whose connection time and status is optimally scheduled and controlled through the operator of the CESS. The CESS charging/discharging is regulated such that the previously determined time targets of PHEV owners are satisfied. To assess performance of the proposed model, extensive numerical studies are carried out in terms of techno-economic indices say as PAR reduction, conducting energy arbitrage, power losses reduction, and etc. Results are discussed in depth. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2023.101053,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2023.101053,16,high

A fair allocation strategy can lead to more efficient use of current transmission lines while providing economic signals to guide future generation planning and load shedding. In this paper, first, using a powerful structural decomposition method, the optimal location of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and wind farms is determined from the flow aspect of grid lines. Then, the transmission fixed cost is assigned to each item placed in the network. The proposed method is implemented on the IEEE 24-bus network, and its results are analyzed.

A careful coordination of the grid operations and charging schedules is needed to alleviate these challenges, and turn them into opportunities. For this purpose, we study the Multi-Period Optimal Power Flow problem (MOPF) with electric vehicles under emission considerations. We integrate three different real-world datasets: household electricity consumption, marginal emission factors, and EV driving profiles. We present a systematic solution approach based on second-order cone programming to find globally optimal solutions for the resulting nonconvex optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose such a comprehensive model integrating multiple real datasets and a promising solution method for the EV-aware MOPF Problem. Our computational experiments on various instances with up to 2000 buses demonstrate that our solution approach leads to high-quality feasible solutions with provably small optimality gaps. In addition, we show the importance of coordinated EV charging to achieve significant emission savings and reductions in cost.

maybe,,Holistic approach for microgrid planning for e-mobility infrastructure under consideration of long-term uncertainty,"Integrating renewable energy sources in sectors such as electricity, heat, and transportation has to be planned economically, technologically, and emission-efficient to address global environmental issues. Microgrids appear to be the solution for large-scale renewable energy integration in these sectors. The microgrid components must be optimally planned and operated to prevent high costs, technical issues, and emissions. Existing approaches for optimal microgrid planning and operation in the literature do not include a solution for e-mobility infrastructure development. Consequently, the authors provide a compact new methodology that considers the placement and the stochastic evolution of e-mobility infrastructure. In this new methodology, a retropolation approach to forecast the rise in the number of electric vehicles, a monte-carlo simulation for electric vehicle (EV) charging behaviors, a method for the definition of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) numbers based on occupancy time, and public EVCS placement based on monte-carlo simulation have been developed. A deterministic optimization strategy for the planning and operation of microgrids is created using the abovementioned methodologies, which additionally consider technical power system issues. As the future development of e-mobility infrastructure has high associated uncertainties, a new stochastic method referred to as the information gap decision method (IGDM) is proposed. This method provides a risk-averse strategy for microgrid planning and operation by including long-term uncertainty related to e-mobility. Finally, the deterministic and stochastic methodologies are combined in a novel holistic approach for microgrid design and operation in terms of cost, emission, and robustness. The proposed method has been tested in a new settlement area in Magdeburg, Germany, under three different EV development scenarios (negative, trend, and positive). EVs are expected to reach 31 percent of the total number of cars in the investigated settlement area. Due to this, three public electric vehicle charging stations will be required in the 2031 trend scenario. Thus, the investigated settlement area requires a total cost of 127,029 €. In association with possible uncertainties, the cost of the microgrid must be raised by 80 percent to gain complete robustness against long-term risks in the development of EVCS. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2023.101073,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2023.101073,16,high
maybe,,Active distribution system planning considering non-utility-owned electric vehicle charging stations and network reconfiguration,"This paper introduces a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for planning active distribution networks and non-utility-owned electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS), using network reconfiguration as a planning option. The method employs multi-objective optimization to address the commercial interests of the utility and the EVCS owner separately. In this manner, the utility makes investment decisions for network assets, such as replacing overloaded conductors and installing capacitor banks and voltage regulators, whereas the EVCS owner decides on the purchase of land and infrastructure for the EVCS installation. Furthermore, as an outstanding feature, the proposed formulation incorporates network reconfiguration within the planning options. The proposed model aims to minimize the total expected cost for both owners. A travel simulation algorithm provides the EVCS load profiles. At the same time, scenario-based optimization addresses uncertainties related to substation energy prices, wind speed, solar irradiance, electricity demand, adoption rate, and loading profile of plug-in electric vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been demonstrated in a 69-node network. The findings show that when deciding where to install the EVCS (network node), the objectives of both owner's clash. This discrepancy, however, can be reduced through network reconfiguration. Finally, the scalability of the proposed method was evaluated using a real 134-node system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2023.101101,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2023.101101,16,high
maybe,,An open-data based framework to estimate EV demand and attainable flexibility and application to the case of Singapore,"The electrification of the transport sector will have consequences that go beyond the transportation system itself, for example by also impacting power distribution networks and their operation. This both comes with potential threats and opportunities, such as sharp stochastic load changes that further burden already stressed power transmission and distribution systems. But opportunities arise from the flexibility that the vehicles batteries charging process could provide, eventually helping in better managing such infrastructures. This paper presents a framework that leverages openly available vehicles mobility-related data sources to define and simulate scenarios of electric mobility adoption, quantifying load and available demand flexibility in such scenarios. In particular, demand flexibility potential is assessed according to different charging strategies, including vehicle to grid, and different vehicles stationing behaviours. The goal is to provide a framework that is potentially of use to a set of different stakeholders, from city planners to grid operators and aggregators, to assess flexibility sources towards several applications.

maybe,,Strategic planning of distribution network integrated with EV charging stations using fuzzy pareto optimality for performance improvement and grid-side emission reduction benefits,"The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution systems requires efficient charging load management techniques for delivering high-quality power to consumers. In this paper, we proposed a strategic planning approach for distribution systems integrated with EV charging stations, employing fuzzy Pareto optimality to enhance system performance and minimize carbon emissions. Our approach involves a fuzzy Pareto heuristic network reconfiguration to minimize real power loss and improve voltage profiles. Additionally, Time of Use (ToU) pricing-based EV charging load scheduling is developed to minimize the annual energy cost. These objectives aim to improve minimum node voltage, reduce power losses, and maintain branch current constraints. To simulate the impact of EV charging loads, we aggregate residential, commercial, and industrial loads, along with EV charging loads at charging stations based on customer choice time and ToU pricing methods. The proposed reconfiguration approach is tested on 33 and 69-bus distribution systems with integrated EV charging stations, distributed generations (DGs), and shunt capacitors (SCs). The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the reconfiguration algorithm in enhancing the performance of the distribution network in the presence of EV loads. Furthermore, we compare ToU pricing-based EV charging time zones with customer comfort-based EV charging, showcasing the advantages of the former in reducing emissions through real power loss reduction. Overall, our strategic planning approach not only improves distribution system performance but also offers economic benefits while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2023.101199,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2023.101199,16,high

Congestion gradually violates the physical, operational and policy constraints of the present electricity market. Congestion management in huge power system remains a challenging and tough task, which can be achieved by introducing one or more Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as Distributed Generation (DG), electric vehicles, modern micro grid, Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) etc. over congested lines. Consequently, this work proposes the hourly congestion management by optimal allocation of DG in `24 hours' time frame. Further, Transmission Congestion Rent is used to determine the optimal and sub optimal locations for DG, whereas Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization based hybrid optimization technique is exploited to identify optimal DG size. In this work, solar based DG along with battery based ESS is considered to act as Distributed Energy Storage System `DESS. Subsequently, Interval computation method is introduced in this work to consider the intermittency of solar DG. Battery Energy Storage System `BESS' is integrated with DGs due to its excess energy storage capability during off-load period and make it available at peak load conditions, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the network. The `24 hours' solar irradiance and temperature data of Delhi, India is taken into account to mathematically model the power generated from Solar DG. The proposed methodology is tested on IEEE 30-bus system and `24 hours' demand data is generated from the original IEEE load data.

In the proposed methodology, a realistic and stochastic charging demand distribution was obtained with the travel chain of an EV and the associated probability density function. Based on the charging demand of EV owners and a multi-operator scenario, a two-stage effective and practical charging station planning model was established. The first stage of the planning model optimized the location of charging stations to decrease the total deadhead mileage of the EVs with the cooperation of the charging station operators. In the second stage, the operators were committed to increasing their economic benefits by developing a charging station capacity strategy in the framework of the non-cooperative game. Furthermore, the combination of an adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization algorithm (AMPSO) and approximate Nash equilibrium had a better effect in reducing the difficulty of solving the game model and obtaining an optimal planning strategy.

This paper proposes a two-stage EV coordination framework for MPDN smart restoration. The first stage is to introduce a novel proactive EV prepositioning model to optimize planning prior to a rare event, and thereby enhance the MPDN survivability in its immediate aftermath. The second stage involves creating an advanced spatial–temporal EV dispatch model to maximize the number of available EVs for discharging, thereby improving the MPDN recovery after a rare event. The proposed framework also includes an information system to further enhance MPDN resilience by effectively organizing data exchange among intelligent transportation system and smart charging system, and EV users.

However, the transitions cause new concerns in the grid including technical challenges and financial viability. This study examines the RES-based MG under realistic conditions considering the uncertainty in fleet size of EVs, emergency generator capacity, solar irradiation, and wind speed in island mode.

maybe,,Stochastic MILP Model for Merging EV Charging Stations with Active Distribution System Expansion Planning by considering Uncertainties,"Radial Power Distribution Networks (PDNs) often suffer from limited reliability, flexibility, and efficiency, leading to service interruptions. Planning for radial PDNs is essential to enhance redundancy resilience, reduce disruptions, and improve overall efficiency. However, traditional PDN planning methods have become obsolete due to the proliferation of Distributed Generation (DG) resources and energy storage systems. Additionally, the rise of Electric Vehicles (EVs) demands sophisticated charging infrastructure planning. This article presents a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for joint expansion planning of PDN and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs). The model takes into account the construction or reinforcement of substations and circuits, along with the integration of EVs, the installation of DGs, and the placement of capacitor banks, all regarded as traditional conventional expansion options alternatives. To address uncertainties associated with DG generation, conventional loads, and EV demand, our model identifies optimal installation and asset locations. We formulate this as a stochastic scenario-based program with chance constraints for Power Distribution Network Expansion Planning (PDNEP), minimizing investment, operational, and energy loss cost costs over a planning horizon. Through two deterministic and stochastic approaches, encompassing six case studies on an 18-node test system, we evaluate the effectiveness of our model. Results are further validated on a 54-node system, confirming the model’s robustness. Notably, the numerical findings underscore the substantial cost reduction achieved by including EVCSs in the stochastic expansion planning approach, demonstrating its cost-effectiveness. In case study I, where all EVs charge at home during peak hours, it’s the worst case for the PDN. The 54-node system, more complex, demands longer computational time. In the 18-node system, costs improve from 9.97% (case study II) to 3.96% (case study VI) versus the worst-case (case I). In the 54-node system, improvements range from 10.47% (case study II) to 1.40% (case study VI). As a result, In comparative analyses against deterministic and stochastic approaches, our model consistently outperforms in diverse test case studies.

The method is tested on a “modified IEEE 33 bus radial active distribution system”. Two different system conditions in which congestion can occur are analyzed and congestion is successfully removed by this proposed method. Power Loss reduction of more than 75% is achieved in each case after the implementation of the proposed methodology. Minimization of voltage deviation and maximization of voltage stability is achieved. The generation cost is minimized by almost 70%. The results obtained show better performance of HFPSO-TOPSIS as compared with other existing techniques.

As the share of power generated from wind energy continues to increase due to environmental concerns and to reduce carbon footprints, the case study proposed is designing an effective wind energy system for a smart building environment to reduce the burden on the grid. Incorporating wind energy systems into grid-connected buildings increases the reliability of the microgrid system for smart building environments. Applying smart techniques with integrated automation in the built environment can play a key role in decreasing peak demand for load development in smart cities. This can also enhance the overall efficiency of power grids, reduce waste, and enable the effective use of energy resources. Furthermore, researchers are finding new ways to collect energy from renewable sources and power-built environments due to dwindling fossil fuel resources and increased environmental awareness. The analysis of wind-connected power systems has been initiated to satisfy the increasing demand for reliable supply systems by consumers. This has prompted the use of wind energy systems with controlled techniques to enhance the reliability of power systems and reduce carbon footprints generated by fossil fuel-based power systems. Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to understand the economic prospects of wind energy sources for smart building environments, reliability analysis of wind energy sources-based power systems, reduce carbon footprints, and balance power demand through wind energy systems. The Progressive Wind Model Taylor-Sequence Proliferation (PWMTSP) and Innovative Six Parameters Based Progressive Beta Creative Model (ISPBPBCM) approaches are proposed to understand the reliability of wind energy-based power systems in smart building environments. The work also provides an economic analysis of the proposed low-cost wind power system with different capacities for residential consumers in selected geographic location. Eight cases are considered for the proposed effective wind energy system for smart building environments ranging from 2 MW to 32 MW. Hence, the economic analysis of the proposed systems is discussed for residential users. All eight cases are eco-friendly and reduce carbon emissions as these generated units from wind energy sources need not be purchased from fossil fuel-based plants, which increases the reliability of the proposed system. The expected energy not supplied (EENS) in the planned work increases as wind power capacity increases. Loss of load expectation (LOLE), loss of load probability (LOLP), and failure rate all decrease with the installation of more wind power systems.

Europe takes initiatives to achieve this goal by developing a super smart grid (SSG) based on renewable energy resources (RERs) by 2050. The SSG is based on two exclusive alternatives: wide area and decentralized power generation using large number of RERs. Before developing such SSG, there is a need to address the critical issues associated with RERs, i.e., load flow balancing and transients stability. Considering a reliability issue involved with RERs and the random deviations between demand response and generation response patterns, load flow balancing and transient stability become challenging research issues in SSGs. These technical issues are also considered to be more challenging, if an unexpected outage in the form of an occurrence of three phase (L-L-L) faults (TPF) arises in SSGs, due to power quality disturbances. To address this problem, load flow balancing probabilistic modeling is performed in this research paper in order to formulate the complexity of randomness between generation and demand response patterns through transmission network planning (TNP) in the form of a super smart node (SSN) transmission network infrastructure. Moreover, a further optimization in SSN transmission network has been done with the addition of a cooperative control strategies in terms of an integrating vehicle to grid (V2G) technology in SSN transmission network in order to achieve further enhancement in load flow balancing and transient stability in SSGs. Furthermore, as SSGs power infrastructure is based on different clusters, therefore in order to accommodate various clusters for load flow balancing, a continuous spinning reserve (CSRs) probabilistic modeling has also been performed in this paper in terms of its integration in SSN transmission network. Considering above probabilistic analysis, future contingencies are easily predictable, before any kind of disruptive changes arises in a SSGs due an occurrence of a TPF. Moreover, from simulation results as performed in this paper, we can easily verified that our proposed probabilistic algorithm of load flow balancing and transients stability outperforms existing literature work and can also achieved near optimal performance, even for a broad range of variations in load and also in case of an arising of significant power quality disturbances in SSGs due to an occurrence of TPF.",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3296152,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2023.3296152,16,high

These scenarios include peak, off-peak, electric power research institute (EPRI), and stochastic scenarios. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the cost of charging scenarios while providing policymakers with a tool to create financial budgets for forthcoming electric vehicle loads. This is achieved through the use of a fuzzy model that has the ability to predict costs. The ANFIS exhibits robust predictive capabilities owing to its aptitude for acquiring and representing intricate non-linear associations between input and output variables. The incorporation of ANFIS into a SAR algorithm results in improved predictive capacity through the optimization of the learning process, enhancement of model accuracy, and facilitation of efficient parameter tuning. The integration of ANFIS and SAR algorithms enhances predictive accuracy and robustness by leveraging the former’s adaptive and learning capabilities and the latter’s global search and optimization capabilities. The model considers various charging strategies and dispatch constraints within an energy hub. The attainment of the 24-hour pricing scheme is achieved by solving a minimum-cost optimization problem, which serves as the initial training data for the development of the proposed model using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy approach. The proposed approach effectively coordinates the various charging behaviours of electric vehicles, including those identified by the EPRI, as well as stochastic, peak, and off-peak charging, at the system level. The proposed methodology offers several advantages, including the facilitation of coordination among various charging scenarios for EVs and the creation of a cost prediction model that can assist policymakers in devising budgetary plans for future EV loads. One of the benefits of this technology is its capacity for autonomy, which enables vehicle owners to charge their electric vehicles in a cost-effective manner, regardless of the specific scenario they find themselves in. Furthermore, the suggested plan has the potential to mitigate the release of greenhouse gases from the power generation sector, thereby facilitating the establishment of a viable charging network that is environmentally sustainable.

This places significant strain on distribution networks (DNs). To address this issue, this paper proposes a promising method that harnesses the untapped potential of electric railway systems (ERSs) and wasted regenerative braking energy (RBE) of trains in combination with a battery energy storage system (BESS) to supply EV charging station and participate in the FCS energy supply chain (FCS-ESCH). The proposed integrated approach, as the intermodal sustainable electric transportation system (SETS), aims to reduce the peak power demand of FCSs especially at strategic locations, such as parking areas close to electric railway stations and park-And-ride areas. To achieve this goal, an operation-Aware optimization model is developed that determines the optimal sizes of the interfacing converter and the BESS, while also proceeding with optimal energy exchange planning. A generic model for trains' RBE production is proposed, as well, and adapted to the operation-Aware optimization model to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting simulations of a real case study that accurately replicates system behavior with the desired level of precision. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are performed to explore the impact of varying the power rating of the interfacing converter responsible for transmitting RBE to the FCS-ESCH, as well as the per-unit price of BESS energy capacity.

The suggested methodology was used to answer the problem of optimal dynamic generation scheduling for the thermal generation unit along with thermal unit integrated with renewable sources such as wind, solar, and electric vehicles. The problem is solved using a unique hybrid CSMA-SCA optimizer in three steps: first, the units are prioritized based on the average full load cost, and the unit scheduling solution is used without consideration of the many constraints that have an impact on the solutions. The second step is the establishment of a heuristic constraints repair mechanism, which forces previous solutions to comply with inescapable constraints. The third step is the implementation of an optimal power generation share allocation for all participating units. To model the stochastic behavior of wind speed and solar radiation, the Weibull probability distribution and Beta PDF functions are used. To avoid the algorithm from slipping into local minima and achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation, a novel chaotic position updating method called Singer map-based position updating is proposed. The suggested method has proven effective in small-, medium-, and large-scale thermal power systems as well as thermal systems that integrate wind power. The extensive studies demonstrate that the CSMA-SCA methodology presented in this research outperforms most current methods in terms of producing high-quality solutions around global minima.

maybe,,Operational Planning for Emerging Distribution Systems: A Unique Perspective on Grid Expansion,"The electrical grid has undergone significant transformations, which have had a profound impact on its distribution system development and expansion. These changes have been primarily driven by changing load profiles, distributed generation sources, and increasingly extreme weather events. Advancements in sensor and communication technologies have played a pivotal role in addressing and adapting to these changes. These changes have also led to an increased focus on reliability and resilience in planning, with priority placed on ensuring robust grid connectivity and flexibility. Three decades ago, power distribution systems were primarily radial with unidirectional power flow. Today’s electrical distribution systems have distributed energy resources, leading to bidirectional power flow. The utility’s geographic information system network, advanced metering infrastructure, and other technologies are leveraged to allow feeders and distributed energy resources to be interconnected. This has facilitated the integration of the electric grid with networked microgrids, which has improved the overall resilience and efficiency of the distribution system. While there have been notable improvements in grid planning, the power grid remains vulnerable to high-impact, low-frequency events caused by climate change, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. This monograph outlines potential solutions for addressing future electric grid issues, including transformer overloading due to electric vehicles, optimization challenges, advanced feeder reconfiguration, and contingency planning for extreme events. The proposed approaches focus on the implementation and operation of new technologies, such as renewable energy sources, batteries, flexible loads, and advanced sensors, that have the potential to transform distribution network planning and operation. From traditional methods to innovative networked microgrids within existing infrastructure and non-wire alternative strategies, this monograph provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art strategies for future problems. ©2023 A.

First, a sequential capacitated flow-capturing location-allocation model (SCFCLM) is proposed at the lower level to optimize the allocation of FCSs on the transportation network. Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) is utilized to estimate daily charging load requirements. Then, we propose an economic model for DNEP at the upper level, and the chance constrained method is employed to relax power flow constraints to address the uncertainties of loads.

Traditional AC power systems can scarcely meet the development demand of new DC trends, especially since both the generation side and load side are comprised of DC-based electronic power components. With this background, low voltage direct current supply and utilization system (LVDCSUS) has attracted more and more attention for its great advantages over an AC grid to overcome challenges in operation, reliability, and energy loss in renewable energy connection, DC load power utilization and a number of other aspects.

maybe,,The Optimal Parking Lot for Electrical Vehicle: An Assessment Based on Artificial Immune System Algorithm,"The optimum location of electric vehicle (EV) parking lots is critical in distribution network design for lowering costs, boosting revenues, and enhancing dependability. However, conventional distribution network schedulers were not designed with these variables in mind. Furthermore, the increased use of EVs for environmental reasons mandates the planning of EV parking spaces. As a result, distribution network designers must examine network technical difficulties, design approaches, and changing consumer needs. The placement of dispersed manufacturing resources and EV parking without sufficient planning and ideal location leads in economic challenges for investors and technical concerns for the network. As a result, future distribution networks should prioritize the ideal placement of EV parking lots and distributed production resources in order to maximize network capabilities and meet the needs of companies and power applications in the digital society. According to the findings, the rate of EV parking installations is very high. When power consumers remain connected to the grid during peak hours, distribution businesses benefit significantly, and the overall voltage profile improves. Variations in electric vehicle (EV) battery capacity, power cost, EV adoption, and the weighting coefficients required for optimization will all have different outcomes. It is critical to precisely determine the battery capacity of electric vehicles (EVs) as well as the efficiency of inverters in order to produce more accurate results. According to the findings, increasing the number of parking lot for EVs in a network enhances the benefit from minimizing losses, and providing peak load significantly.

EVs can participate as a manufacturer in the electricity market through Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technology. This greatly improves the reliability of distribution systems. Therefore, it is necessary to plan the charging and discharging processes in the parking lot. This paper investigated di erent strategies for planning the charging and discharging processes of EVs considering the random and unpredictable nature of various parameters, as well as the limitation of the power exchange between the distribution system and parking, to evaluate the impact of V2G-equipped parking lots on reliability. An appropriate strategy is the strategy that increases the owner's interest in the parking. Therefore, the strategies are designed independent of the duration of EVs presence in the parking and considering the limitations of power exchange with the distribution system.

In other words, reasonably planning the location and capacity of charging stations is important for development of the EV industry and the safe and stable operation of the power system. Considering the construction and maintenance of the charging station, the distribution network loss of the charging station, and the economic loss on the user side of the EV, this paper takes the node and capacity of charging station planning as control variables and the minimum cost of system comprehensive planning as objective function, and thus proposes a location and capacity planning model for the EV charging station. Based on the problems of low efficiency and insufficient global optimization ability of the current algorithm, the simulated annealing immune particle swarm optimization algorithm (SA-IPSO) is adopted in this paper. The simulated annealing algorithm is used in the global update of the particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the immune mechanism is introduced to participate in the iterative update of the particles, so as to improve the speed and efficiency of PSO. Voronoi diagram is used to divide service area of the charging station, and a joint solution process of Voronoi diagram and SA-IPSO is proposed. By example analysis, the results show that the optimal solution corresponding to the optimisation method proposed in this paper has a low overall cost, while the average charging waiting time is only 1.8 min and the charging pile utilisation rate is 75.5%.

Accurate EV charging load prediction is essential for the efficiency of electric system planning and economic operation of electric system. This paper proposes an electric vehicle charging load predicting method based on variational mode decomposition and Prophet-LSTM. Firstly, the variational mode decomposition algorithm is used to decompose the charging load into several intrinsic mode functions in order to explore the characteristics of EV charging load data. Secondly, in order to make full use of the advantages of various forecasting methods, the intrinsic mode functions are classified into low and high frequency sequences based on their over-zero rates. The high and low frequency sequences are reconstructed to obtain two frequency sequences. Then the LSTM neural network and Prophet model are used to predict the high and low frequency sequences, respectively. Finally, the prediction results obtained from the prediction of high frequency and low frequency sequences are combined to obtain the final prediction result. The assessment of the prediction results shows that the prediction accuracy of the prediction method proposed in this paper is improved compared to the traditional prediction methods, and the average absolute error is lower than that of ARIMA, LSTM and Prophet respectively by 7.57%, 8.73%, and 46.02%.

The lack of widespread public charging infrastructure hinders this electric vehicle (EV) transition. Extreme fast charging along interstates and highway corridors is a potential solution. However, the legacy power grid based on alternating current (AC) beckons for costly upgrades that will be necessary to sustain sporadic fast charging loads. The primary goal of this paper is to propose a sustainable, low-loss, extremely fast charging infrastructure based on photovoltaics (PV) and co-located lithium-ion battery storage (BESS). Lithium-ion BESS plays a pivotal role in our proposed design by mitigating demand charges and operating as an independent 16–18 h power source. An end-to-end direct current power network with high voltage direct current interconnection is also incorporated. The design methodology focuses on comprehensive hourly EV-load models generated for different types of passenger vehicles and heavy-duty fleet charging. Appropriate PV-BESS sizing, optimum tilt, and temperature compensation techniques based on 15 years of irradiation data were utilized in the design.

maybe,,How Can EVs Support High RES Penetration in Islands,"The electrification of the transportation sector contributes to a cleaner environment in non-interconnected island (NII) systems or standalone islands. Moreover, e-mobility can significantly contribute to achieving very high renewable energy source (RES) penetration levels in islands, allowing a reduction both in the emissions due to the conventional generation and the system’s cost. Ιncreased RES penetration, however, can pose technical challenges for an island’s system. In order to overcome these challenges, new technologies like grid-forming converters are important. Moreover, the provision of new ancillary services in relation to battery storage systems might be considered, while novel control and protection schemes are needed to ensure secure operation. E-mobility can also contribute to solving technical problems that arise from very high RES penetration by providing frequency containment reserves or reactive power compensation. Since EV charging demand introduces modifications in the system’s load curve, e-mobility may affect the power grid for long-term planning and short-term operation, i.e., line loading and voltages. The application of specifically developed smart charging methodologies can mitigate the relevant grid impact, while effective exploitation of EV–RES synergies can achieve higher RES penetration levels. This paper examines how e-mobility can contribute to increasing RES penetration in islands while considering the technical issues caused. In particular, this paper takes into account the distinct characteristics of NIIs towards the identification of solutions that will achieve very high RES penetration while also addressing the relevant technical challenges (voltage control, frequency control, short circuit protection, etc.). The effect of e-mobility in the power grid of NII systems is evaluated, while smart charging methodologies to mitigate the relevant impact and further increase RES penetration are identified. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/en16010558,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en16010558,16,high

The appropriate sizing and positioning of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) are concurrently determined to curtail the negative impact of their placement on the distribution network’s operational parameters. The charging station location problem is presented in a multi-objective context comprising voltage stability, reliability, the power loss (VRP) index and cost as objective functions. RES and EVCS location and capacity are chosen as the objective variables. The objective functions are tested on modified IEEE 33 and 123-bus radial distribution systems. The minimum value of cost obtained is USD 2.0250 × 106 for the proposed case. The minimum value of the VRP index is obtained by innovative scheme 6, i.e., 9.6985 and 17.34 on 33-bus and 123-bus test systems, respectively.

maybe,,Electric Vehicle Charging Hub Power Forecasting: A Statistical and Machine Learning Based Approach,"Electric vehicles (EVs) penetration growth is essential to reduce transportation-related local pollutants. Most countries are witnessing a rapid development of the necessary charging infrastructure and a consequent increase in EV energy demand. In this context, power demand forecasting is an essential tool for planning and integrating EV charging as much as possible with the electric grid, renewable sources, storage systems, and their management systems. However, this forecasting is still challenging due to several reasons: the still not statistically significant number of circulating EVs, the different users’ behavior based on the car parking scenario, the strong heterogeneity of both charging infrastructure and EV population, and the uncertainty about the initial state of charge (SOC) distribution at the beginning of the charge. This paper aims to provide a forecasting method that considers all the main factors that may affect each charging event. The users’ behavior in different urban scenarios is predicted through their statistical pattern. A similar approach is used to forecast the EV’s initial SOC. A machine learning approach is adopted to develop a battery-charging behavioral model that takes into account the different EV model charging profiles. The final algorithm combines the different approaches providing a forecasting of the power absorbed by each single charging session and the total power absorbed by charging hubs.

This study aimed to assess the energy transition of an island towards a 100% renewable energy system for power generation, inland transport, and potable water provision. Linking various fossil-fuel-consuming sectors, such as transport and potable water supply systems, may strongly assist in reducing the possible mismatch between renewable energy source production and demand and contribute to fulfilling other system requirements. The use of energy storage technologies is vital and unlike traditional power systems; as the number of components in the system increases, their proper capacity needs to be accurately determined. This work employs a multi-objective optimization assessment using a modified NSGA-II algorithm to depict the energy transition for Porto Santo Island. To evaluate the solutions, we considered the main criteria of energy cost, avoided environmental impacts (CO<inf>2</inf>-equivalent emissions) of the proposed system, and loss of power supply. The Pareto front contains various solutions under different system configurations. Results indicate that full inland transport electrification (introducing 3000 EVs) can account for 18% of the avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the island while sharing 28–40% of the up-front cost of the system, depending on the proposed system’s components. The EV’s costs incorporate subsidies and their battery replacement. Another interesting finding from the optimization process is that the solution with the highest avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions involves keeping a diesel generator for supplying 4% of the island’s total demand and using an underwater compressed air energy storage with a capacity of 280 MWh. This suggests that adding more installed wind turbines or PV panels may not necessarily contribute to reducing the emissions of the entire system. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/en16104146,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en16104146,16,high

maybe,,"Non-Iterative, Unique, and Logical Formula-Based Technique to Determine Maximum Load Multiplier and Practical Load Multiplier for Both Transmission and Distribution Systems","In recent days, due to the increasing number of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and additional power consumption by domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers, the overall power system performance suffers, which further degrades voltage profile, reduces stability, increases losses, and may also create a voltage collapse problem. Therefore, it is crucial to predetermine a maximum loadability limit for voltage collapse analysis and a practical allowable extra load for safe and secure operation, keeping the bus voltage within the security limits. To mitigate the problems, unique and innovative formulae such as the maximum load multiplier (MLM) and practical load multiplier (PLM) have been developed to consider line resistance. The determination of actual permissible extra load for a bus enables quick assessment of bus-wise suitable capacities and the number of EVs that can be charged simultaneously in the charging station.

maybe,,Two-Stage Optimal Active-Reactive Power Coordination for Microgrids with High Renewable Sources Penetration and Electrical Vehicles Based on Improved Sine−Cosine Algorithm,"As current global trends aim at the large-scale insertion of electric vehicles as a replacement for conventional vehicles, new challenges occur in terms of the stable operation of electric distribution networks. Microgrids have become reliable solutions for integrating renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, and are considered a suitable alternative for accommodating the growing fleet of electrical vehicles. However, efficient management of all equipment within a microgrid requires complex solving algorithms. In this article, a novel two-stage scheme is proposed for the optimal coordination of both active and reactive power flows in a microgrid, considering the high penetration of renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and electric mobility. An improved sine-cosine algorithm is introduced to ensure the day-ahead optimal planning of the microgrid’s components aiming at minimizing the total active energy losses of the system. In this regard, both local and centralized control strategies are investigated for multiple generations and consumption scenarios. The latter proved itself a promising control scheme for the microgrid operation, as important energy loss reduction is encountered when applied. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/math11010045,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/math11010045,16,high
maybe,,Control and Optimisation of Power Grids Using Smart Meter Data: A Review,"This paper provides a comprehensive review of the applications of smart meters in the control and optimisation of power grids to support a smooth energy transition towards the renewable energy future. The smart grids become more complicated due to the presence of small-scale low inertia generators and the implementation of electric vehicles (EVs), which are mainly based on intermittent and variable renewable energy resources. Optimal and reliable operation of this environment using conventional model-based approaches is very difficult. Advancements in measurement and communication technologies have brought the opportunity of collecting temporal or real-time data from prosumers through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Smart metering brings the potential of applying data-driven algorithms for different power system operations and planning services, such as infrastructure sizing and upgrade and generation forecasting. It can also be used for demand-side management, especially in the presence of new technologies such as EVs, 5G/6G networks and cloud computing. These algorithms face privacy-preserving and cybersecurity challenges that need to be well addressed. This article surveys the state-of-the-art of each of these topics, reviewing applications, challenges and opportunities of using smart meters to address them.

maybe,,Optimal Dispatch Strategy for Electric Vehicles in V2G Applications,"The overutilization of electric vehicles (EVs) has the potential to result in significant challenges regarding the reliability, contingency, and standby capabilities of traditional power systems. The utilization of renewable energy distributed generator (REDG) presents a potential solution to address these issues. By incorporating REDG, the reliance of EV charging power on conventional energy sources can be diminished, resulting in significant reductions in transmission losses and enhanced capacity within the traditional power system. The effective management of the REDG necessitates intelligent coordination between the available generation capacity of the REDG and the charging and discharging power of EVs. Furthermore, the utilization of EVs as a means of energy storage is facilitated through the integration of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Despite the importance of the V2G technology for EV owners and electric utility, it still has a slow progress due to the distrust of the revenue model that can encourage the EV owners and the electric utility as well to participate in V2G programs. This study presents a new wear model that aims to precisely assess the wear cost of EV batteries, resulting from their involvement in V2G activities. The proposed model seeks to provide EV owners with a precise understanding of the potential revenue they might obtain from participating in V2G programs, hence encouraging their active engagement in such initiatives. Various EV battery wear models are employed and compared. Additionally, this study introduces a novel method for optimal charging scheduling, which aims to effectively manage the charging and discharging patterns of EVs by utilizing a day-ahead pricing technique.

maybe,,A Multi-Objective Planning Strategy for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations towards Low Carbon-Oriented Modern Power Systems,"This paper proposes a multi-objective planning framework for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in emerging power networks that move towards green transportation electrification. Four cases are investigated to study the impacts of EV integration on environmental and economic requirements. In order to facilitate the installation of EV charging stations, the proposed model is formulated to combine the planning models of renewable energy systems, energy storage systems (ESSs), thyristor-controlled series compensators, and transmission lines into the EV-based planning problem. The first objective function aims to maximize EVs’ penetration by increasing the networks’ capacity to supply charging stations throughout the day, whereas the second objective, on the other hand, emphasizes lowering the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-based generation units in order to benefit the environment. The third objective is to meet the financial requirements by lowering the initial investment and operating costs of the installed devices. The proposed model is written as a multi-objective optimization problem that is solved using the multi-objective version of the Gazelle optimization algorithm (MGOA). The efficiency of the MGOA was tested by solving a set of four benchmark test functions and the proposed problem. The obtained results demonstrated the MGOA’s superiority in solving multi-objective optimization problems when compared to some well-known optimization algorithms in terms of robustness and solution quality. The MGOA’s robustness was between 20% and 30% and outperformed other algorithms by 5%. The MGO was successful in outperforming the other algorithms in providing a better solution. The Egyptian West Delta Network simulations revealed a 250 MWh increase in the energy supplied to EVs when energy storage was not used. However, storage systems were necessary for shifting EV charging periods away from high solar radiation scenarios. The use of ESS increased greenhouse gas emissions. When ESS was installed with a capacity of 1116.4 MWh, the carbon emissions increased by approximately 208.29 million metric tons. ESS’s role in improving the EV’s hosting capacity grows as more renewables are added to the network.

maybe,,Effective Deterministic Methodology for Enhanced Distribution Network Performance and Plug-in Electric Vehicles,"The rapid depletion of fossil fuel motivates researchers and policymakers to switch from the internal combustion engine (ICE) to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). However, the electric power distribution networks are congested, which lowers the accommodation of PEVs and produces higher power losses. Therefore, the study proposes an effective deterministic methodology to maximize the accommodation of PEVs and percentage power loss reduction (%PLR) in radial distribution networks (RDNs). In the first stage, the PEVs are allocated to the best bus, which is chosen based on the loading capacity to power loss index (LCPLI), and the accommodation profile of PEVs is developed based on varying states of charge (SoC) and battery capacities (BCs). In the second stage, the power losses are minimized in PEV integrated networks with the allocation of DG units using a recently developed parallel-operated arithmetic optimization algorithm salp swarm algorithm (AOASSA). In the third stage, the charging and discharging ratios of PEVs are optimized analytically to minimize power losses after planning PEVs and DGs. The outcomes reveal that bus-2 is the most optimal bus for accommodation of PEVs, as it has the highest level of LCPLI, which is 9.81 in the 33-bus system and 28.24 in the 69-bus system. The optimal bus can safely accommodate the largest number of electric vehicles, with a capacity of 31,988 units in the 33-bus system and 92,519 units in the 69-bus system. Additionally, the parallel-operated AOASSA mechanism leads to a reduction in power losses of at least 0.09% and 0.25% compared with other algorithms that have been previously applied to the 33-bus and 69-bus systems, respectively. Moreover, with an optimal charging and discharging ratio of PEVs in the IEEE-33-bus radial distribution network (RDN), the %PLR further improved by 3.08%, 4.19%, and 2.29% in the presence of the optimal allocation of one, two and three DG units, respectively. In the IEEE-69-bus RDN, the %PLR further improved by 0.09%, 0.09%, and 0.08% with optimal charge and discharge ratios in the presence of one, two, and three DG units, respectively. The proposed study intends to help the local power distribution companies to maximize accommodation of PEV units and minimize power losses in RDNs. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/su15097078,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/su15097078,16,high

Apart from the power sector, the growth of electric vehicles (EVs) is leading to a rising power demand. These problems can potentially lead to blackouts. This paper presents three meta-heuristic techniques: grey wolf optimization (GWO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and dandelion optimizer (DO) for optimal allocation (sitting and sizing) of solar photovoltaic (SPV), wind turbine generation (WTG), and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The aim of implementing these techniques is to optimize allocation of renewable energy distributed generation (RE-DG) for reducing active power losses, reactive power losses, and total voltage deviation, and to improve the voltage stability index in radial distribution networks (RDNs). MATLAB 2022a was used for the simulation of meta-heuristic techniques. The proposed techniques were implemented on IEEE 33-bus RDN for optimal allocation of RE-DGs and EVCSs while considering seasonal variations and uncertainty modeling. The results validate the efficiency of meta-heuristic techniques with a substantial reduction in active power loss, reactive power loss, and an improvement in the voltage profile with optimal allocation across all considered scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/su15097499,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/su15097499,16,high
maybe,,Load Profile and Load Flow Analysis for a Grid System with Electric Vehicles Using a Hybrid Optimization Algorithm,"As they become more widespread, electric vehicles (EVs) will require more electricity to charge. It is expected that a range of grid transportation solutions that complement one another and considerable transmission infrastructure changes will be needed to achieve this goal. Strategic planning and control, including economic models and strategies to engage and reward users, can reduce energy loss on the power network. This would eliminate grid upgrades. Bidirectional charging of EVs can help transmission systems cope with EV allocation. Power loss and voltage instability are the transmission network’s biggest issues. Adding EV units to the transmission network usually solves these problems. Therefore, EVs need the right layout and proportions. This study determined where and how many radial transmission network EVs there should be before and after the adjustment. To discover the best EV position and size before and after the dial network modification, a hybrid genetic algorithm for particle swarm optimization (HGAIPSO) was utilized. Electric vehicles coordinated in an active transmission network reduce power losses, raise voltage profiles, and improve system stability. Electric vehicles are responsible for these benefits. The simulation showed that adding EVs to the testing system reduced power waste. The system’s minimum bus voltage likewise increased. The proposed technology reduced transmission system voltage fluctuations and power losses, according to the comparison analysis. The IEEE-30 bus test system reduced real power loss by 40.70%, 36.24%, and 42.94% for the type A, type B, and type C EV allocations, respectively.

First, based on the load density method and occupancy rate to predict the base electricity load in the community, the Bass model and charging probability are used to predict the community’s electric vehicle charging load. Taking the minimum annual construction and operation costs of the community distribution network as the objective function, the power supply topology of the distribution network for a new community is optimized by using Prim and single-parent genetic algorithms.

maybe,,Optimal Location of Electric Vehicle Charging Station in Reconfigured Radial Distribution Network,"Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular because they are cleaner-burning and more efficient than combustion-engine automobiles. Due to the diminishing availability of fossil fuels and the carbon emissions produced by cars, electric vehicles (EV) have become a need for mobility in the near future. Electric car charging stations were established as a consequence of the increase in EVs. Electric car charging lowers voltage and increases real power loss in the radial distribution network. In order to mitigate real power loss and provide a stable voltage profile, the charging station has to be placed as efficiently as possible. The current research examines and elucidates the influence of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) on the balanced radial distribution network (BRDN) using particle swarm optimization (PSO). There are two steps involved in the planning process. The optimal placement for EVCS [1] in BRDN is identified in the first stage using PSO. The second stage uses reconfiguration to ensure higher EVCS stability. This two-step technique's main goal is to decrease the real power loss due to the placement of charging stations in the radial distribution network (RDN). The correctness of the suggested approach is expounded upon in four different cases. The second, third, and fourth cases use a two-step procedure, which is then compared to the base case. In the base case EVCS is ideally located in BRDN using PSO. The fourth case employs a concurrent two-step optimization approach and demonstrates superior performance compared to other cases. The suggested approach is implemented and evaluated on the IEEE 69 bus BRDN using the MATLAB software. © 2023 by the Dandu Srinivas and Dr. M.

maybe,,Digital twin based reinforcement learning for extracting network structures and load patterns in planning and operation of distribution systems,"Low voltage distribution networks deliver power to the last mile of the network, but are often legacy assets from a time when low carbon technologies, e.g., electrified heat, storage, and electric vehicles, were not envisaged. Furthermore, exploiting emerging data from distribution networks to provide decision support for adapting planning and operational strategies with system transitions presents a challenge. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel application of digital twins based reinforcement learning to improve decision making by a distribution system operator, with key metrics of predictability, responsiveness, interoperability, and automation. The power system states, i.e., network configurations, technological combinations, and load patterns, are captured via a convolutional neural network, chosen for its pattern recognition capability with high-dimensional inputs. The convolutional neural networks are iteratively trained through the fitted Q-iteration algorithm, as a batch mode reinforcement learning, to adapt the planning and operational decisions with the dynamic system transitions. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by reducing 50% of the investment cost when the system transitions towards the winter and maintaining the power loss and loss of load within 5% compared to the benchmark optimisation. Doubled power consumption was observed in winter under future energy scenarios due to the electrification of heat. The trained model can accurately adapt optimal decisions according to the system changes while reducing the computational time of solving optimisation problems, for a range of scales of distribution systems, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment by a system operator.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121128,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121128,16,high
maybe,,Impact of demand growth on decarbonizing India's electricity sector and the role for energy storage,"Global energy sector decarbonization efforts are contingent on technology choices for energy production and end-use in emerging markets such as India, where air conditioning (AC) is expected to be a major driver for electricity demand growth. Here, we assess the impact of demand and supply side-drivers on the long-term evolution of the electricity sector in India under various technology and policy scenarios. Our analysis is based on developing: (a) multiple demand scenarios produced from a bottom-up forecasting model with high temporal resolution that capture structural changes in electricity consumption resulting from (AC) and electric vehicle (EV) adoption, and (b) a multi-period power system capacity expansion model with high temporal resolution of grid operations to model supply-side evolution in response to changes in demand and technology and policy factors. Such a framework allows us to, for example, quantify the impacts of improving appliance efficiency standards for AC systems or shifts in EV charging patterns on power system decarbonization prospects. Under projected renewables and Li-ion storage cost declines, our modeling points to solar and wind generation contributing substantially (46–67%) to meet annual electricity demand in India by 2030. However, without appropriate policy measures to phase out existing coal generation, even such rapid adoption of variable renewable energy coupled with one or more technological levers such as low-cost energy storage and demand-side measures such as setting aggressive AC efficiency standards and deploying distribution level storage, are insufficient to reduce annual CO2 emissions in 2050 vs. 2020 because of the relatively higher growth rate of projected electricity demand over this period. This suggests that deep decarbonization of India's power sector will require policy measures beyond efforts related to accelerating renewables deployment.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egycc.2023.100098,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egycc.2023.100098,16,high

At its core, electrification relies on integrating insights that span the supply and demand side of power systems, resolving operational characteristics and long-term climate change, and the integration of previously independent engineered systems. However, our modeling landscape consists of a suite of models that focus on distinct sectors (power, buildings, transport) and spatial–temporal scales (municipal, provincial, federal). This paper probes whether the existing suite of energy system models, which span sectors, disciplines, and jurisdictions, is up to the task of charting net-zero pathways, specifically in the Canadian context. To do so, we analyze an inventory of energy system models that are being used in practice using a recently assembled model database. Next, we supplement our analysis with a web-based search and literature review. For each model category, we describe the key modeling approaches, strengths and weaknesses, and typical ways and areas in which these models are applied. We find that by focusing on a specific scale and sector, these models by their very definition, omit out-of-scope interactions leaving critical information gaps. Many of the most imperative areas for future research straddle multiple sectors or multiple scales—electric vehicle charging, carbon policy coordination, regional electricity trading, to name a few.

maybe,,Optimal deployment of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles considering the sizing of the electrical distribution network and traffic condition,"The conventional vehicle fleet worldwide has contributed to the degradation of air quality due to CO2 emissions. Consequently, it has migrated from internal combustion to electric vehicles (EVs). However, it is essential to ensure the deployment of electric vehicle charging station infrastructures (EVCSI) to guarantee their interoperability for the development of electric mobility. Moreover, the sustainability of EVCSI depends not only on the capacity to meet demand but also on the adequate number of terminals in the different public charging stations (CS) to reduce waiting times for battery recharging. Then to achieve an optimal sizing of charging stations, it is crucial to foresee the maximum number of vehicles that could use the different CS during a time interval. The sizing of CS must respond to real mobility constraints and technical conditions, such as the capacity of vehicular flow, the capacity of the roads according to their geometry, the trajectories marked by the users, and the possible exit of operation of some CS. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem considering four fundamental axes, which are: stochastic analysis of heterogeneous vehicular flow, a solution to the transportation problem with the capacitated multicommodity flow problem and Hungarian algorithm, analysis of the optimal number of terminals considering loading times, and finally the proposed EVCSI will be validated using the CymDist software for electrical engineering.

Afterward, EV batteries need to remove due to their insufficient power and energy capacity to satisfy the range and speed requirements. Increasing EV sales means numerous second-life batteries (SLB) will be available for second-use applications. Besides the price and capacity differences of SLB, technical properties such as depth of discharge (DOD), temperature, and cycle life will directly affect the performance. This study comprehensively examines SLB feasibility, focusing on the technical and financial uncertainties of SLBs in stationary energy storage applications. In addition, the contribution of SLB to the marginal cost-revenue balance is optimized by considering various operating criteria and four different battery aging sub-models. The remaining capacity and DOD effects were analyzed, and break-even points were determined. Sensitivity analyses also assess the carbon tax and the performance of SLB in different climatic zones. Finally, the accuracy of technical, economic, and environmental performance has been increased with multi-year sensitivity analysis. According to optimal results, SLB could increase energy efficiency up to 14% with 80% capacity and under 80% DOD. It has also been found that if the SLB cost is less than 57% of the fresh battery (FB), the same system will reach the break-even point.

Some systems that can face the challenges of increasing population will help develop the smart city. Today, the relationship between various urban systems, such as transportation, communication and business networks, is very complicated. These complexities have greatly enhanced the importance of intelligent and quick coordination of cities with modern technologies.

The framework consists of a day-ahead (DA) scheduling stage and an intraday adjustment stage. The DA scheduling stage formulates the VPP's internal controllable resource scheduling strategy and the energy market's bidding plan. The intraday adjustment stage provides flexibility to adjust the scheduling strategy of controllable resources in the VPP to enhance power generation stability. To address profit distribution issues, the paper proposes a profit distribution strategy based on scheduling costs of each component unit of the VPP. The VPP considers various factors, such as battery capacity degradation, carbon credit trading, flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs), and novel demand response (DR) strategies. The case study demonstrates that accounting for battery capacity degradation reduces the utilization of energy storage systems (ESSs) and EVs, while considering controllable load and EVs increases the VPP's flexibility and decreases carbon emissions.

maybe,,A cooperative EV charging scheduling strategy based on double deep Q-network and Prioritized experience replay,"The rapid growth of the number of electric vehicles (EVs) has significantly increased the demand for electricity of residents, which may lead to transformer overload of distribution networks if there is no reasonable power consumption planning. In view of the coordinated charging of EVs under the photovoltaic (PV) energy connected to the power grid, a collaborative charging control strategy is proposed based on a double deep q-network with Prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER). Specifically, Long–Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is utilized to capture the uncertainties caused by power requirement, PV power, and real-time electricity price. Then, a modified DDQN approach and the corresponding reward function are applied to solve the cooperative charging problem. In addition, the introduction of a PER mechanism based on TD bias sampling in reinforcement learning alleviates the problem of reward sparsity in learning scenarios and improves the training stability and efficiency. The proposed approach can achieve collaborative scheduling of EVs, which helps reduce the charging cost, promote the consumption of PV energy and avoid transformer overload. Simulation case studies based on real data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the charging cost by 30% and increase the PV power utilization by 10% compared to the DDQN algorithm.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105642,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105642,16,high
maybe,,Charging and discharging of PHEVs in smart grids with ICA and TLBO algorithms with the approach of simultaneously reducing network peak load and distribution costs,"The widespread use of electric vehicles is a suitable solution to deal with the reduction of fossil fuel reserves and the increase in air pollution. Reducing pollution can be realized through optimal planning of charging and discharging of electric vehicles as consumers and storage of electric energy. Also, vehicles connected to the network increase the reliability of the network during power outages. However, the connection of electric vehicles to the grid can also bring limitations. The uncoordinated and unmanaged presence of electric vehicles as an additional load in the network can aggravate problems such as voltage drop, voltage stability and increase in network losses. Consequently, these problems will have economic costs. In this way, the management of charging and discharging of electric vehicles will be of special importance in the future of control and operation of distribution networks. In this article, electric vehicle charging and discharging management has been done in order to minimize the amount of active power loss, bus voltage deviation, increase the stability of the network voltage, and as a result, reduce the costs of the distribution company. For this purpose, a 33-bus distribution network that absorbed its required energy only through the connection point to the network was studied with different scenarios in which the objective function of the problem was different. The proposed algorithm was implemented to calculate the best state of charging and discharging of cars. In choosing these vehicles, it has been tried to examine all charging modes.

maybe,,Wind curtailment mitigation in presence of battery energy storage and electric vehicle: A comprehensive multi-objective decision-support framework,"Concern to maintain exploitation of power system in secure mode, the wind curtailment (WR) caused by the perpetual fluctuating of wind power (WP) can menace the operational power system schedule. The mentioned phenomenon will intensify by high WP penetration into the power system. In addition, incorporating plugged-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the power system along with the WP intermittent will increase the vagueness rating of the problem. Due to the expansion and development of battery energy storage (BES), the possibility of power shortage compensating and accumulating additional power produced by wind farms (WFs) has been engendered. Providing a stochastic scenario-based structure with different correlation levels can increase the robustness of the model. Here, a two-stage model has been proposed to overcome such a high-dimensioned problem. The first stage determined the scheduled power output of thermal generators (TGs) as the unit commitment (UC) problem to minimize operational costs. Next, by reckoning the supplementary constraints, the scheduled WP, which is re-optimized, will be obtained. The second stage has employed to detect the BES capacity. In this stage, the intelligent parking lots (IPLs) assign price-based signal impetus to the PHEVs to participate in economic dispatch. Due to the prominence of being equipped with the supreme decision-making facility for the intelligent decision-maker operator (IDMO), the augmented epsilon-constraint method has been employed to capture the Pareto sets of some multi-objective functions. The optimum solution has been selected by the decision-making method (DMM) according to the operator's preferences. The results of proposed Multi-Objective Decision-Support (MODS) model show that the total operation cost and BES sizing have dropped by 68 and 6.1 percent, respectively. The performance of the proposed model has been testified through the IEEE-30 bus system via GAMS software.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137215,2023,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137215,16,high

However, energy storage is challenging for prosumers due to high investment costs and long payback periods. The second use of batteries has been evaluated as an alternative energy storage after the first service in electric vehicles with the remaining 80% capacity. This study investigates the feasibility of using secondary-use batteries as shared storage for prosumers. Financial and technical break-even points regarding the gradually increasing carbon limit on the way to 100% renewable have been determined. The proposed method's performance has been verified by conducting sensitivity analyses regarding various environmental and economic characteristics. The self-consumption rates have been achieved by 65.9% in Spain (Madrid) and 49.9% in England (London), and 48.5% in Türkiye (Antalya) without incentive. Increasing the carbon tax by 1 $/t for high and low energy tariffs can reduce carbon emissions by 181.3 and 1607 kg/yr. The optimum sizes remain until the carbon tax threshold is 60 $/tCO2eq for high energy tariffs. After 60 $/tCO2eq, it is tended to enlarge the hybrid power system. However, severe carbon emission restriction for zero carbon targets prevents the optimum system design since the carbon reduction cost increases to 232.7–304.8 $/kg.

Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can cause difficulties in the electrical grid and system operation. To circumvent this issue, an efficacious stochastic optimization model is developed in this paper to enable the control entity to manage generation and storage assets by controlling the charging behavior of PEVs. To achieve the lowest total cost, a new strategy for reducing reliability costs is proposed. In this regard, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) tool is used to reduce the overall system cost. The presented energy management model for the MG in the grid-connected mode takes into consideration the uncertainty of output power of the wind turbine (WT) and the photovoltaic (PV), as well as the PEVs’ charging and discharging. In this study, an innovative and effective optimization algorithm known as the modified fluid search optimization algorithm (MFSO) is utilized to optimize the MG operation problem. The results show that the suggested model incorporating electric vehicles (EVs) can enable MG operation at the minimum cost and reliability. As can be observed, the amount of time required by the presented method to solve the first case problem is 6.64s, which is significantly less than the amount of time required by the other methods.

Current operations and maintenance models lack the flexibility to accommodate this increased variability and its effects on degradation, leading to more frequent start/stop cycles that significantly impact asset lifespans. In this paper, we propose a robust optimization framework designed to optimize generation maintenance schedules and unit commitment decisions in power systems. Our approach explicitly models the impact of start/stop cycling on remaining useful lifetime distributions, providing accurate failure risk assessments. By incorporating sensor-informed and decision-dependent degradation models within an operations and maintenance optimization model, our framework effectively balances lifetime utilization, failure risks, and operational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through computational experiments using real-world degradation signals, demonstrating its advantages over the benchmark models. © 2025",10.1016/j.ress.2025.111776,2026,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ress.2025.111776,15,high

The paper incorporates an improved Harris Hawks Optimizer combined with Particle Swarm Optimization, termed HHO-PSO. Uncertain parameters of the problem, such as energy prices, spinning reserve, non-spinning reserve prices, and renewable output, are also considered. Additionally, the lattice Monte Carlo simulation and roulette wheel mechanism are utilized. By adopting an objective function that optimizes multiple goals, the paper proposes an approach to assist generation companies (GenCos) in maximizing profit (PFM) and minimizing emissions (EMM). However, to make the modeling of the multi/single-objective day-ahead hydro-thermal self-scheduling problem with WP, PV, PSH, and LS-EVs practical, additional factors must be considered in the problem formulation.

However, the subjectivity and unpredictability of users' trip plans in special circumstances significantly impact the dispatching results of EV clusters. To address this issue, this paper establishes a real-time trip chain correction model that integrates power and traffic networks to simulate the distribution of EV charging loads under spatiotemporal reconfiguration. Furthermore, considering the dispatchable potential of EVs after trip completion, a user behavior decision-making method is proposed. This method utilizes fuzzy control to analyze EV charging demand and quantifies the degree of user responsiveness to the dispatching strategy. Then, based on the charging urgency index, a coordinated dispatching strategy is introduced to mitigate grid fluctuations, reduce peak loads, and lower user charging costs. Finally, experiments analyze the effects of spatiotemporal reconstruction and decision-making behavior on the EV dispatching process. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in reducing users' charging costs while achieving peak load reduction and valley filling in the power grid.

maybe,,State of the art for moth-flame optimization applied electric vehicles–solar–wind–hydro–thermal power system,"The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has a significant impact on the safe and reliable operation of the power system, and the widespread integration of wind power also possesses serious problems with predictability. In contrast, solar power is less efficient than wind power in terms of converting sunlight into electricity. Moreover, combination of wind power and solar power is most popular green energy alternatives among the various renewable energy sources because solar energy cannot be harnessed at night while wind energy can be harnessed even at night. So, it is getting harder to use renewable energy sources (RESs). However, fossil fuels are the main reasons for toxic and most dangerous pollution. In this research, hydro–thermal scheduling (HTS) problem integrating wind, solar, and EVs is examined using a novel method called the moth-flame optimization algorithm (MFO). The suggested HTS problem’s main goal is to reduce the cost of power generation while satisfying several kinds of constraints, including losses occurring in the transmission, the effect of valve point on the thermal unit, and the unpredictability of RESs. Many electric vehicles (EVs), often referred to as cloud-based distributed power plants, are being developed as virtual power plants (VPPs), which are combined with clean energy sources to efficiently manage energy control. The objective of this presentation is to meet every constraint while reducing fuel costs. This is accomplished by balancing load demand and losses occurring in the transmission line while meeting every condition. By analyzing the generation cost using MFO, the effectiveness of the system is carried out and being compared with the others newly developed existing optimization methods to show the higher efficacy, usefulness, as well as robustness of proposed optimization technique.

maybe,,Resiliency-constrained placement and sizing of virtual power plants in the distribution network considering extreme weather events,"The placement and scale of virtual power plants (VPPs) in distribution networks are the only topics covered in this article that pertain to the resilience of the grid to severe weather. This problem is framed as a two-objective optimization, where the expected energy that the network would not deliver in the case of an earthquake or flood (expected energy not-supplied), and the annual planning cost of the VPP, are the two objective functions to be minimized. Noted that the expected energy not-supplied in the earthquake or flood condition is considered as the resiliency index. The constraints include the formula for VPP planning, limitations on network operation and resilience, and equations for AC power flow. Uncertainties about demand, renewable power, energy prices, and the supply of network hardware and VPP components are all taken into account in stochastic programming. The proposed technique achieves a single-objective formulation in the subsequent stage by the use of a Pareto optimization strategy based on the epsilon-constraint method. This article uses a solver based on a hybrid of Crow search algorithm (CSA) and sine cosine algorithm (SCA) to achieve the trustworthy optimal solution with lowest dispersion in the final response. In order to tackle the problem, the proposed system looks at how the VPP affects network resilience, scales it, and combines it with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm. In the end, with the implementation of the proposed design on the distribution network of 69 buses, the obtained numerical results confirm the ability of optimal placement and dimensions of VPPs in improving the economic status, utilization and resilience of the distribution network.",10.1007/s00202-024-02583-6,2025,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s00202-024-02583-6,15,high
maybe,,Economic planning of EV charging stations and renewable DGs in a coupled transportation-reconfigurable distribution network considering EV range anxiety,"To support the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) in the transportation network (TN), one significant obstacle has to be addressed: range anxiety, i.e. concern about running out of energy before finding another charging station. This study proposes a two-stage strategy for optimal placement and sizing of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and renewable distributed generators (DGs) in a coupled TN and distribution network (DN) by considering EV range anxiety. In the first stage, an integer particle swarm optimization algorithm and M1/M2/S queueing theory are used to find the best locations and sizes of EVCS while ensuring possible origin–destination round trips in a TN can be completed with a waiting time constraint. The objective function considered in this stage is maximizing EVCS operator profit. In the second stage, DN integrated with EVCS is used to obtain the ideal sites and sizes of renewable DGs. Modified Newton–Raphson load flow with a Q-PQV bus pair determines the ideal sites and sizes of renewable DGs while improving DN performance. A cost–benefit analysis is carried out to check whether DG planning is profitable. Hong’s 2 M+1 point estimate method incorporates the uncertainties related to EV behaviour and renewable sources. The validity of the proposed strategy is investigated using a coupled 33-bus DN with a 25-node TN system. The results reveal that considering EV range anxiety, the suggested approach effectively identifies the best locations and sizes for EVCS and renewable DGs beneficial for both EVCS and DN operators. Additionally, network reconfiguration increases the DN operator’s profit. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s00202-024-02823-9,2025,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s00202-024-02823-9,15,high
maybe,,Active and Reactive Power Joint Optimization of Active Distribution Network with Charging-Swapping-Storage Integrated Station Participating,"With the proposal of China's ``carbon peak{''} strategy, the large-scale promotion of electric vehicles has become a trend.

The outer layer optimization emphasizes the overall active/reactive power output plan of CSSIS from the global perspective of AND, in order to improve the safety and economy of ADN operation and reduce charging cost of electric vehicles. The internal optimization focuses on the specific output plan within CSSIS, achieving complementarity between regulatory resources, and suppressing fluctuations in load power and node voltage. In order to reduce the adjustment pressure of dynamic power supply in real-time optimization, a robust optimization method was adopted in the day-ahead optimization, which improved the system's ability to handle uncertain factors and achieved the ``friendliness{''} of CSSIS connecting to ADN.

This forecasting model was validated through a comparison of the original 2022 historical data with the model-generated data for 2022. Next, the model-generated data for 2030 demand was used to increase the long-term forecasting accuracy by effectively capturing complex periodic seasonality and non-decreasing trends. An operating-reserve demand curve was generated based on the long-term forecast data, and the practical use of long-term forecasted demand in reserve planning for future power systems was demonstrated.

maybe,,Centralised rehearsal of decentralised cooperation: Multi-agent reinforcement learning for the scalable coordination of residential energy flexibility,"This paper investigates the use of deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for the coordination of residential energy flexibility. Particularly, we focus on achieving cooperation between homes in a way that is fully privacy-preserving, scalable, and that allows for the management of distribution network voltage constraints. Previous work demonstrated that MARL-based distributed control can be achieved with no sharing of personal data required during execution. However, previous cooperative MARL-based approaches impose an ever greater training computational burden as the size of the system increases, limiting scalability. Moreover, they do not manage their impact on distribution network constraints. We therefore adopt a deep multi-agent actor–critic method that uses a centralised but factored critic to rehearse coordination ahead of execution, such that homes can successfully cooperate at scale, with only first-order growth in computational time as the system size increases. Training times are thus 34 times shorter than with a previous state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach without the factored critic for 30 homes. Moreover, experiments show that the cooperation of agents allows for a decrease of 47.2% in the likelihood of under-voltages. The results indicate that there is significant potential value for management of energy user bills, battery depreciation, and distribution network voltage management, with minimal information and communication infrastructure requirements, no interference with daily activities, and no sharing of personal data. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124406,2025,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124406,15,high
maybe,,Stackelberg-equilibrium-based collaborative charging management strategy for renewable fuel vehicles in regional integrated electricity‑hydrogen system,"This paper presents a Stackelberg-equilibrium-based optimization approach for solving the collaborative charging management problem of electrical vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles (HVs). A transaction framework for electricity‑hydrogen exchange among the vehicle fleet aggregator (VFA), the electrical power system operator (EPSO) and the hydrogen system operator (H2SO) is proposed. The optimization model, based on a bi-layer Stackelberg game, aims to minimize the electricity‑hydrogen costs for the VFA in the upper layer, and maximize the economic benefits for the EPSO and the H2SO in the lower layer. A Stackelberg-game model is formulated and solved using the DEA-MILP approach. The proposed optimization strategy is evaluated using a regional integrated electricity‑hydrogen system (RIEHS), which consists of an IEEE 33-bus distribution power system and a 6-node hydrogen system. The evaluation considers the impacts of distribution locational marginal price (DLMP) profile of electricity and hydrogen, as well as the penetration of EV-HV and electrolysis. The simulation results show that: 1) the proposed Stackelberg-equilibrium-based bidding mechanism can determine the electricity‑hydrogen DLMP based on the data from VFA and RIEHS; 2) the optimization strategy enables collaborative charging management of EVs and HVs, as well as electricity‑hydrogen dispatch within RIEHS; and 3) implementing the proposed strategy leads to a reduction in the energy cost for the VFA and alleviates operating power congestion for the RIEHS. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124617,2025,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124617,15,high
maybe,,Eco-power management system with operation and voltage security objectives of distribution system operator considering networked virtual power plants with electric vehicles parking lot and price-based demand response,"In the energy management of a network, it is expected that by extracting the optimal performance for the power sources, storage equipment, and responsive demand, a favorable economic and technology situation is achievable for the network and the mentioned elements. Virtual power plants, as a unit aggregating resources, storage, and responsive loads, can create more favorable conditions in network energy management. So, it is expected that the positive effect of the virtual power plant format on the economic and technical situation of the distribution system is far more than those of managing individual elements mentioned in the network. Consequently, the distribution network operator's economic, environmental, and technical goals are met through the concurrent administration of reactive and active power in the smart distribution network that is equipped with a flexible-sustainable virtual power plant. The system operator is accountable for reducing the weighted sum of the voltage security index, energy loss, and energy cost of the distribution network. This problem is associated with the optimal power flow formulation, which considers the environmental limits and security of voltage in the distribution network, the renewable resource operation model and flexibility in the form of a virtual power plant, and the system's flexibility constraints. Flexibility resources considered in the present study are pricebased demand response and electric vehicle parking lots. Stochastic optimization relying on the Unscented Transform assists in providing a suitable model for uncertain quantities resulting from the amount of load, electric vehicles, renewable power, and price of energy and eventually shortens the computing time and accurately computes the flexibility index. The optimal compromise solution amongst various objective functions can be found through fuzzy decisionmaking. Some innovations of this research include concurrent administration of active and reactive power in virtual power plant, concurrent modeling of economic, operational, environmental, voltage security, and flexibility indicators in the distribution network, utilization of electric vehicles, and demand response as a source of flexibility, use of Unscented transform for modeling the uncertainties corresponding to the exact calculation of flexibility. The suggested method was simulated in the IEEE 69-bus radial smart distribution system. Regarding the numerical report obtained, the optimal performance of each of the renewable generation, demand response, and parking of electric vehicles can significantly impact the economic and technical condition of the distribution network. However, the best condition was obtained when the mentioned elements were placed in the form of a virtual power plant. So, in such a situation, the energy cost is around \$1862 for the said network. The lowest value for the worst security index in this network is around 0.933 p.u. Energy loss, maximum voltage drop, and peak load carrying capability are equal to 1.902 MWh, 0.047 p.u., and 5.624 MW, respectively. As a result, and based on numerical findings, the method can attain sustainable social welfare. The optimal power scheduling of sustainable systems can enhance the economic, security of voltage, and operational, conditions of the network by roughly 43 \%, 26.9 \%, and 47 \%-62 \%, respectively, compared to power flow studies. Furthermore, the ideal administration of virtual power plants enables the proposed plan to achieve 100 \% flexibility. Additionally, it can substantially diminish the degree of contamination within the distribution network.",10.1016/j.compeleceng.2024.109895,2025,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.compeleceng.2024.109895,15,high

To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a two-stage collaborative optimization strategy for EV charging scheduling with photovoltaic (PV) system. In the upper-stage optimization, a Variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is presented to learn the real EV charging event distribution, and the generated charging events are used to achieve the optimization of the on-site PV system scale. In the lower-stage optimization, using the optimal PV system scale obtained from the upper-stage optimization to calibrate the output power, a collaborative optimization of EV charging scheduling and PV system using the Lagrange multiplier method is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is analyzed and validated using real-world, full-day charging data collected from charging facilities at the parking lots of Caltech campus.

maybe,,Unlocking peak shaving: How EV driver heterogeneity shapes V2G potential,"As electric vehicles (EVs) and variable renewable energy sources rapidly expand, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services have emerged as a promising strategy to enhance grid flexibility. However, their effectiveness critically depends on EV drivers’ willingness to participate, which is shaped by behavioral heterogeneity and operational constraints. While previous studies have explored participation preferences, they have largely overlooked time-specific availability and its implications for system-level flexibility. This study addresses this gap by integrating a discrete choice experiment with latent class modeling to analyze both user preferences and the peak shaving potential of V2G. To capture temporal availability more accurately, “weekday connection time” is introduced as a novel contract attribute, enabling realistic estimates of time-specific charging and discharging flexibility. The analysis identifies three distinct driver segments, each characterized by unique preferences for monetary incentives, minimum connection days, charger accessibility, weekday connection frequency, and state-of-charge guarantees. Scenario-based simulations incorporating these heterogeneous profiles indicate that tailored V2G program designs could reduce peak net load by up to 22.9 % by 2030. These findings underscore the importance of differentiated policy instruments and aggregator strategies that reflect user diversity. The study provides a behaviorally grounded framework for designing inclusive and effective V2G programs that contribute to a more flexible and sustainable power system. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2025.136773,2025,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2025.136773,15,high

Previous research has established useful modeling approaches. However, limitations to expressing macro and local characteristics simultaneously remain. To address this deficiency, this study developed a data-driven workflow to extract vehicle usage profiles from human mobility big data collected from mobile devices to quantify vehicle usage, EV charging demand, and flexibility on a large scale at a high spatiotemporal resolution. The application to entire Japan showed that if all the private vehicles are electric, uncontrolled home charging would reach a maximum of 25 GW. EVs have significant flexibility potential through smart charging and vehicle-to-grid operations. The 1 km-mesh-resolution data showed that activity patterns, demand, and flexibility vary considerably depending on the accessibility to public transportation.

According to the characteristics of the various adjustable resources in the network, they are divided into day-ahead and intraday optimizations. The optimization process in the day-ahead stage uses the NSDBO to create a discrete equipment scheduling plan. The optimization process in the intraday stage combines the discrete equipment scheduling plan with the MPC to create the scheduling plan for photovoltaics, energy storage, and vehicle charging stations. Two-stage optimization scheduling is achieved with the lowest discrete equipment regulation cost and minimization of network loss and node voltage deviation penalty cost as the optimization goal. The feasibility of this method for coordinating various resources in the network, processing discrete and continuous variables, and coping with the volatility and uncertainty of high-proportion distributed resources is verified through case analysis. The effectiveness of this method in improving the security and economy of distribution networks is demonstrated.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing optimal allocation of wind power-based Distributed Generation (DG) resources in a 240-bus power distribution network with residential EV charging. As EV charging peaks in the evening, wind power-based DGs are more effective than solar-PV alternatives.

DTBO balances exploration and exploitation effectively, offering a novel, intelligent optimization approach. Its performance is validated through benchmark tests and comparisons with algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO). For case studies, wind speed data and turbine parameters are sourced from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) and manufacturer datasheets, while EV charging demand is modelled using National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) 2017 data.

In the context of exponential EV growth and the provision of charging facilities from low-voltage distribution networks, the distribution network may require frequent upgrades to meet the rising charging demands. To avoid network congestion problems and minimize operational expenses (OE) by integrating energy storage systems (ESS) into ultra-fast charging stations (UFCS). This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of a UFCS equipped with a battery ESS (BESS). To reduce reliance on the electric grid and minimize OE, a dual-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved via grid search and dual- simplex algorithms. Analytical energy and physical BESS models are employed to evaluate the optimization matrices. The intricacies of BESS aging are examined to ensure an optimal BESS size with a more extensive lifespan than the corresponding payback period. The integrated BESS significantly reduced reliance on the grid to tackle network congestion while fulfilling charging demands. The dynamic pricing (DP) structure has proven more favorable, as the average per unit cost remains lower than the static tariff (ST). Results illustrate that integrating BESS reduces the OE and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) by 5-to-49\% and 16-to-73\%, respectively.

Despite the potential of EV loads offering emergency demand response (DR) for addressing such challenges, the willingness of EVs to respond to DR and the actual response quantity are uncertain. Furthermore, the uncertainty level in EV response varies along with DR incentive decisions, which further aggravates operation challenges. This paper proposes a resilient unit commitment (UC) model for EV-integrated power systems against extreme cold events. Specifically, first, we model how the temperature-sensitive EV charging loads change under extreme cold events considering the actual driving range and air conditioning load in EVs. Then, the inter-coupling relationship between uncertainties in EV response quantity and the DR incentive decisions is modeled. To overcome the limitations of conventional modeling approaches for decision-independent uncertainty, an affine function-based tractable model reformulation is presented addressing decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) in EV response. Subsequently, we establish the resilient UC model within a two-stage stochastic framework considering temperature-sensitive EV loads and DDU in EVs’ response behaviors.

maybe,,Optimum Resource Sizing and Operation in Virtual Power Plant Framework: VPP optimization and operation,"The optimum size and operation of virtual power plants (VPPs) are essential for sustainable green power systems in modern society. Renewable energy (mainly wind and solar) is intermittent and non-dispatchable. The aggregator of available energy storage systems and controllable loads, including heating, cooling, EV charging/discharging, etc., can mitigate those issues in the VPP framework and maintain system balance. The VVP platform's wind speed, solar radiation, and load demand are highly dynamic. Without intelligent coordination, it is impossible to determine the optimal size of the resources with minimum operation cost. An overestimate of resources suffers from unnecessary excess capital cost, which might not be feasible. On the other hand, an underestimate of resources builds an unreliable VPP. It is a multi-objective complex problem considering the minimization of capital and operation costs as objectives, subject to many constraints, including net zero emission. Moreover, an intelligent energy management system (EMS) is deployed considering present and near future dynamic forecasted demand profile, state of charge (SoC) of storage, and power availability from renewables for reliability, and maintains net zero energy and emission. All the dispatch and transaction communications in VPP are committed to using blockchain. This paper uses an intelligent multi-objective strategy to design and optimize a generalized VPP model. Historical wind speed, solar radiation, and load profiles over a long period are used as inputs for the model. An intelligent energy management system for the dispatch of resources is carried out.

EVs can serve either as a load or storage, presenting a dual-faceted challenge to power system planning and operation. As a result, there is a growing need for comprehensive reliability assessment in the presence of EVs. This paper proposes improved reliability assessment frameworks for systems with large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) operating in battery exchange (BE) and plug-in modes. Initially, a reliability model for BE electric vehicles (BEVs) is formulated using a time-series aggregated EV user load profile, BE station operation strategy, and off-peak battery exchange mode of BEVs. Additionally, a random-sampling-based operational algorithm is developed for plug-in EVs (PEVs), considering their charging, discharging, and grid support modes. A composite reliability assessment framework is then developed, incorporating an optimization model that accounts for the aggregated operations of BEVs and PEVs. The effect of EVs on the system reliability is assessed using the mixed-timing sequential Monte Carlo simulation on the IEEE RTS-79 and the RTS-GMLC systems. Simulation results show that up to 18% improvement in reliability indices is achieved with a 15% penetration of BEVs operating in off-peak mode. Also, the same penetration of PEVs with grid-support modes yields up to 14% improvement in system reliability. Finally, the impacts of BEV and PEV integration on the loading and reliability of transmission lines and power transformers are analyzed.",10.1109/TIA.2025.3544559,2025,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tia.2025.3544559,15,high

Electric vehicle chargers integrate with distribution networks via power electronic interfaces, offering significant control and operational flexibility. The industry is quickly adapting to this rapidly emerging load type, and now requires a robust means for understanding their impact on power system operations. This paper presents a modeling approach to capture the aggregate dynamic impact of these chargers on the power system in response to a range of network fault conditions. Six commonly available electric vehicles were empirically tested under various supply disturbances using a grid simulator, and their fault ride-through performances have been characterised. The undervoltage withstand capability of the six vehicles varied considerably, with fault voltage thresholds ranging between 0.3 and 0.7 pu leading to electric vehicles either ceasing charging for between ∼2 and 10 seconds, or locking out completely. A composite dynamic load model for electric vehicles was developed and validated, employing the collected empirical data. The validation process demonstrated the aggregate load model's capability to accurately capture the resulting load deficit owing to electric vehicle fault ride-through in response to transmission-level faults.

First, a mathematical model of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles and their power systems is constructed, and convolutional neural networks are used to classify road surfaces. Next, a Markov decision process that matches the obstacle avoidance decision scenarios is systematically established, and a deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to design the decision threshold for obstacle avoidance decisions.

These charging stations serve as intermediaries that connect supply and demand, drawing power from the grid and renewable energy sources to provide electricity to electric vehicles. Maintaining a delicate balance between supply and demand has emerged as a significant challenge for the charging system. On a macroscopic level, it impacts the power grid’s peak load and reliability, while locally, it influences electric vehicle detour events. To comprehensively model the spatio-temporal characteristics in the charging system, we partition the charging system by adopting a supply-demand-aware approach and propose OPS, an online power scheduling algorithm based on the regularization technique. OPS aims to achieve a bi-level balance between supply and demand while constraining the power output of the charging system. We substantiate the efficacy of OPS through rigorous theoretical proofs, demonstrating its comparability to the optimal solution. Furthermore, we conduct extensive evaluation experiments with real-world data sets to establish the feasibility of the proposed methodology in alleviating the supply-demand imbalance.

A comprehensive investigation of the operating theory and steady-state parameters of the proposed family of bidirectional converters highlights the features of wide voltage gain in both forward and backward modes. Furthermore, the continuous nature of currents at the input and output sides of the proposed converters enhances the battery’s lifetime and reduces the size of the dc-link capacitor.

In this work, we aim to uncover spatiotemporal characteristics of LAAs that can lead to serious impact. The problem is challenging since existing protection measures, such as $N-1$ security designed to make the power system resilient to single component failures, also provide resilience to load changes to a large extent. Thus, strategically injected load perturbations that lead to network failure can be regarded as rare events. To this end, we adopt a rare-event sampling approach to uncover LAAs distributed temporally and spatially across the power network. The key advantage of this sampling method is the ability to sample efficiently from multi-modal conditional distributions with disconnected support. Furthermore, we systematically compare the impacts of static (one-time manipulation of demand) and dynamic (attack over multiple time periods) LAAs. We perform extensive simulations using benchmark IEEE test bus systems. The results show (i) the superiority and the need for rare-event sampling in the context of uncovering LAAs as compared to other sampling methodologies, (ii) statistical analysis of attack characteristics and impacts of static and dynamic LAAs, and (iii) cascade sizes (due to LAA) for different network sizes and load conditions.",10.1109/TPWRS.2024.3419725,2025,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpwrs.2024.3419725,15,high

In practice, the co-optimization problem for power-transportation systems can be overly complicated due to a great deal of uncertainty and many decision variables rooted in the EV population and mobile energy storage. Another challenge is the heterogeneity in terms of size and supporting capability due to various types of such mobile entities. This work aims to facilitate power-transportation co-optimization by proposing and formalizing the concept of Circulating Loads (CirLoads) to generalize these spatial-temporal dispatchable entities. With the new concept, the stochastic process of CirLoads’ movement is introduced using Brownian particles for the first time. Such novel particle motion-based modeling for EVs can reflect their stochastic behaviors over time without requiring exact data of EVs.

maybe,,Grid-Aware Scheduling and Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Dispatching Active Distribution Networks: Theory and Experimental Validation,"This paper proposes and experimentally validates a grid-aware scheduling and control framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) for dispatching the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs). The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage (day-ahead), we determine an optimal 24-hour power schedule at the grid connection point (GCP), referred to as the dispatch plan. Then, in the second stage, a real-time model predictive control (RT-MPC) is proposed to track the day-ahead dispatch plan using flexibility from EVCSs and other controllable resources (e.g., batteries). The dispatch plan accounts for the uncertainties of vehicles connected to the EVCS along with other uncontrollable power injections, by day-ahead predicted scenarios. The RT-MPC accounts for the uncertainty of the power injections of stochastic resources (such as demand and generation from photovoltaic – PV plants) by short-term forecasts. The framework ensures that the grid is operated within its nodal voltage and branches power-flow operational bounds, modeled by a linearized optimal power-flow model, maintaining the tractability of the problem formulation.

maybe,,Promote Data Sharing in Integrated Power-Traffic Networks: A Coalition Game Approach,"Accurately estimating spatial-temporal electric vehicles' (EVs) charging demands is crucial for the secure and economic operation of power systems. At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO.

However, the joint modeling and optimal scheduling for multiple BSSs is complex and rarely researched, especially when the idle state of charging bays (CBs) is non-negligible. In this article, for the distribution network (DN) with multiple BSSs, a joint optimal charging scheduling strategy considering the idle state of CB is developed to ensure the system’s safe operation and BSSs’ economic charging. In particular, a three-layered coupled model for multiple BSSs is constructed by modeling on the CB, BSS, and DN layers, which is used to visualize each BSS’s state quantity changes and their charging behaviors’ impacts on DN. To further improve the accuracy of this model, the CB’s idle state is given special consideration by developing a three-stage modeling method, which can detailedly describe the finite state transfer of CBs. In addition, to deal with the joint scheduling of multiple BSSs (JS-MBSS) problem upon the constructed model, a bi-level solving algorithm is proposed to convert the complex JS-MBSS into a solvable mixed integer quadratic constraint program (MIQCP).

On the transportation side, EV tracks also have a significant impact on traffic congestion. Moreover, the division of carbon responsibilities for EVs is unclear, which seriously affects the long-term healthy development of carbon reduction strategies. Therefore, this article comprehensively considers EV charging scheduling and traffic trajectories and proposes a new joint optimization method for PDNs and EV tracks. Additionally, the method also takes into account the allocation of carbon emission responsibilities. Specifically, a three-layer iterative optimization framework is established. In the first layer, a carbon emission flow model is established based on the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) framework, and price signals reflecting the carbon responsibility of each node are obtained. Then, using these price signals, the second layer employs evolutionary game theory to determine the charging prices at different nodes. In the third layer, a two-objective track optimization model is proposed to minimize operation cost and maximize traffic flow, and the charging demand of each node is fed back to the first layer until the iteration converges. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is designed, driven by the Lagrangian function, the Bellman-Ford augmented path algorithm, and the Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow algorithm, to efficiently solve this problem.

maybe,,Design of Joint Cyber-Attacks on Electric Vehicle Charging via Pricing and Traffic Manipulation to Threaten Secure Operation of Power Systems,"The rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) has strengthened the coupling between transportation and power systems. Meanwhile, the continuous growth in demand for EV charging would significantly impact the secure operation of power systems. Considering the vulnerability of vehicle navigation communication networks, this paper proposes a novel and practical joint cyber-attack scheme to manipulate the charging and route planning results of EV charging navigation. This cyber-attack can minimize both the charging price at the target EV charging station (EVCS) and the driving time required to reach the target EVCS, thus threatening the secure operation of power systems by attracting excessive EVs to charge at the target EVCS. Firstly, a two-level optimization model is proposed to identify the target EVCS based on the partially observable distribution network. This model identifies the EVCS that pose the greatest threat to the secure operation of power systems. Subsequently, a cyber-attack model is developed to manipulate the driving time of EVs to the target EVCS. The attack vector is designed to be stealthy to evade detection and sparse to minimize attack cost.

To deal with high renewable energy penetration, it is important to improve the energy efficiency and stability of the distribution network. In this paper, the optimal configuration of a distribution network with a high proportion of new energy and electric vehicles is investigated.

maybe,,"Real-Time Power System Optimization Under Typhoon Weather Using the Smart “Predict, Then Optimize” Framework","With the increase of extreme weather events caused by global climate change, the issue of power system resilience has become more and more important. Traditional power system management methods cannot cope with dynamic real-time changes, and it is difficult to effectively predict and respond to potential failures caused by extreme weather. To this end, this paper proposes a real-time power system optimization method based on the Smart “Predict, then Optimize” (SPO) framework. The SPO method first uses the Transformer model to predict, in real time, the future line damage states and then dynamically adjusts the optimization strategy based on the prediction results. This method can efficaciously enhance the prediction accuracy of faulty lines under extreme weather conditions and optimize generation scheduling, load management, as well as EV battery scheduling to minimize the system cost. This study proposes a solution based on the SPO loss function, artificial intelligence prediction model, and bi-level optimization model to address the dynamic optimization of power systems under extreme conditions, significantly enhancing the system’s response to extreme weather events. The experimental results demonstrate that the SPO method can optimize system operation in real time, significantly reducing load shedding and total system cost during typhoon weather, which not only improves the system’s economic efficiency but also effectively enhances power system resilience. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18030615,2025,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18030615,15,high
maybe,,Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Optimization for Solar-Powered EV Charging Under Spatiotemporal Uncertainty in Urban Distribution Networks,"The rapid electrification of transportation and the proliferation of rooftop solar photovoltaics (PVs) in urban environments are reshaping the operational dynamics of power distribution networks. However, the inherent uncertainty in electric vehicle (EV) behavior—including arrival times, charging preferences, and state-of-charge—as well as spatially and temporally variable solar generation, presents a profound challenge to existing scheduling frameworks. This paper proposes a novel data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DDRO) framework for solar-powered EV charging coordination under spatiotemporal uncertainty. Leveraging empirical datasets of EV usage and solar irradiance from a smart city deployment, the framework constructs Wasserstein ambiguity sets around historical distributions, enabling worst-case-aware decision-making without requiring the assumption of probability laws. The problem is formulated as a two-stage optimization model. The first stage determines day-ahead charging schedules, solar utilization levels, and grid allocations across an urban-scale distribution feeder. The second stage models real-time recourse actions—such as dynamic curtailment or demand reshaping—after uncertainties are realized. Physical grid constraints are modeled using convexified LinDistFlow equations, while EV behavior is segmented into user classes with individualized uncertainty structures. The model is evaluated on a modified IEEE 123-bus feeder with 52 EV-PV nodes, using 15 min resolution over a 24 h horizon and 12 months of real-world data. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed DDRO method reduces total operational costs by up to 15%, eliminates voltage violations entirely, and improves EV service satisfaction by more than 30% relative to deterministic and stochastic baselines. This work makes three primary contributions: it introduces a robust, tractable optimization architecture that captures spatiotemporal uncertainty using empirical Wasserstein sets; it integrates behavioral and physical modeling within a unified dispatch framework for urban energy-mobility systems; and it demonstrates the value of robust coordination in simultaneously improving grid resilience, renewable utilization, and EV user satisfaction. The results offer practical insights for city-scale planners seeking to enable the reliable and efficient electrification of mobility infrastructure under uncertainty. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/en18154001,2025,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en18154001,15,high
maybe,,A Pricing Strategy for Key Customers: A Method Considering Disaster Outage Compensation and System Stability Penalty,"When power system equipment fails due to disasters, resulting in the isolation of parts of the network, the loads within the isolated system cannot be guaranteed a continuous power supply. However, for critical loads—such as hospitals or data centers—continuous power supply is of utmost importance. While distributed energy resources (DERs) within the network can supply power to some loads, outages may lead to compensation and fairness issues regarding the unsupplied loads. In response, this study proposes a methodology to determine the appropriate power contract price for key customers by estimating the unsupplied power demand for critical loads in isolated networks and incorporating both outage compensation costs and voltage stability penalties. The microgrid under consideration comprises DERs—including electric vehicles (EVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), photovoltaic (PV) plants, and wind turbine (WT) plants—as well as controllable resources such as battery energy storage systems (BESS) and hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS). It serves both residential load clusters and critical loads associated with social infrastructure. The proposed methodology is structured in two stages. In normal operating conditions, optimal scheduling is simulated using second-order conic programming (SOCP). In the event of a fault, mixed-integer SOCP (MISOCP) is employed to determine the optimal load shedding strategy. A case study is conducted using the IEEE 123 bus test node system to simulate the outage compensation cost calculation and voltage penalty assessment processes.

maybe,,Transmission Network Expansion Planning Method Based on Feasible Region Description of Virtual Power Plant,"In response to China’s “Dual Carbon” goals, this paper proposes a Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP) model that explicitly incorporates the operational flexibility of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). Unlike conventional approaches that focus mainly on transmission investment, the proposed method accounts for the aggregated dispatchable capability of VPPs, providing a more accurate representation of distributed resources. The VPP aggregation model is characterized by the inclusion of electric vehicles, which act not only as load-side demand but also as flexible energy storage units through vehicle-to-grid interaction. By coordinating EV charging/discharging with photovoltaics, wind generation, and other distributed resources, the VPP significantly enhances system flexibility and provides essential support for grid operation. The vertex search method is employed to delineate the boundary of the VPP’s dispatchable feasible region, from which an equivalent model is established to capture its charging, discharging, and energy storage characteristics. This model is then integrated into the TNEP framework, which minimizes the comprehensive cost, including annualized line investment and the operational costs of both the VPP and the power grid. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved using the Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm. A case study based on the Garver-6 bus and Garver-18 bus systems demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. The results show that, compared with traditional planning methods, strategically located VPPs can save up to 6.65% in investment costs. This VPP-integrated TNEP scheme enhances system flexibility, improves economic efficiency, and strengthens operational security by smoothing load profiles and optimizing power flows, thereby offering a more reliable and sustainable planning solution. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/wevj16110590,2025,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/wevj16110590,15,high

maybe,,Optimal charging for large-scale heterogeneous electric vehicles: A novel paradigm based on learning and backward clustering,"As the number of electric vehicles (EVs) surges, how to optimally manage the diverse charging behaviors of substantial heterogeneous EVs presents a significant challenge, as random charging activities may cause catastrophic consequences to disrupt power systems. While centralized control methods have garnered attention for their potential to achieve global optimality, they are primarily suitable for small or medium-sized EV fleets due to their high computational demands. In this work, to harness the benefits of centralized control methods while remarkably enhancing computational efficiency, a novel backward clustering scheme is introduced. The scheme is trained using optimal scheduling datasets collected from substantial cases involving small-scale EVs to categorize heterogeneous EVs with similar charging patterns but distinct states during dynamic charging. Subsequently, an online model predictive control is utilized to effectively manage distinct groups of EVs identified by the clustering method, rather than individual EVs. This control paradigm notably reduces the control dimension, alleviating the computational burden of centralized control. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control paradigm shows satisfactory performance, achieving near-optimal performance with only a 3% increase in total charging costs even in the case where 1000 EVs randomly participate in energy and ancillary electricity markets. More importantly, the calculation time can be reduced by 92% when compared to the benchmark methods, making its real-time implementation feasible.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125232,2025,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125232,15,high

However, sector coupling integrating electricity, heating and transportation can play a key role as a source of demand-side flexibility to support the system in managing uncertainty resulting from the integration of renewable and distributed energy resources. In this paper, we proposed an operational framework for vehicle-to-everything operation of electric vehicle fleets with mixed-use buildings acting as charging stations for demand-side flexibility provision. The proposed framework provides aggregators with risk-aware flexibility quantification, robust market bids, and real-time control decisions. It uniquely combines sector coupling with stochastic optimization and predictive control to enhance energy management at site level and unlock new revenue generation from flexibility provision. Our contribution advances the state-of-the-art by enabling coordinated, uncertainty-aware flexibility provision across multiple sites, while integrating both electric and thermal systems into a unified operational framework. The approach was tested on real demonstrators in Switzerland and Spain, highlighting the cost–benefits of demand-side flexibility provision, which resulted in monthly net revenues that far surpassed the energy costs of the charging station.

Irrespective of the charging stations’ internal alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) bus configurations, the main concern is the exponential growth in charging demands, resulting in network congestion issues. In the context of exponential EV growth and the provision of charging facilities from low-voltage distribution networks, the distribution network may require frequent upgrades to meet the rising charging demands. To avoid network congestion problems and minimize operational expenses (OE) by integrating energy storage systems (ESS) into ultra-fast charging stations (UFCS). This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of a UFCS equipped with a battery ESS (BESS). To reduce reliance on the electric grid and minimize OE, a dual-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved via grid search and dual-simplex algorithms. Analytical energy and physical BESS models are employed to evaluate the optimization matrices. The intricacies of BESS aging are examined to ensure an optimal BESS size with a more extensive lifespan than the corresponding payback period. The integrated BESS significantly reduced reliance on the grid to tackle network congestion while fulfilling charging demands. The dynamic pricing (DP) structure has proven more favorable, as the average per unit cost remains lower than the static tariff (ST). Results illustrate that integrating BESS reduces the OE and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) by 5-to-49% and 16-to-73%, respectively.

Specifically, first, we model how the temperature-sensitive EV charging loads change under extreme cold events considering the actual driving range and air conditioning load in EVs. Then, the inter-coupling relationship between uncertainties in EV response quantity and the DR incentive decisions is modeled. To overcome the limitations of conventional modeling approaches for decision-independent uncertainty, an affine function-based tractable model reformulation is presented addressing decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) in EV response. Subsequently, we establish the resilient UC model within a two-stage stochastic framework considering temperature-sensitive EV loads and DDU in EVs’ response behaviors.

This paper proposes a hybrid approach for EV smart charging with network expansion planning. The hybrid technique is the joint execution of the coati optimization algorithm (COA) and cascade-correlation-growing deep learning neural network, commonly known as the COA-CCG-DLNN technique. The objective of the proposed method is to minimize the cost of charging EVs, and it forecasts the best course of action.

As smart grids increasingly incorporate decentralized prosumers, innovative coordination strategies are essential to fully exploit their potential and improve system self-healing capabilities. To address this need, this paper presents a novel bi-level strategy for managing the self-healing process within a smart grid influenced by Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRSs), Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs), and energy hubs. This approach taps into the combined potential of these prosumers to boost system self-healing speed and reliability. In the initial stage, the Smart Grid Operator (SGO) conducts self-healing planning during emergencies, communicating required nodal capacities to prevent forced load shedding and outlining incentives for smart prosumers. Subsequently, prosumers schedule their activities and contribute flexible capacities to the SGO. Bridging the first and second stages, an adaptive Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm ensures convergence between the SGO and prosumer schedules within a decentralized framework. This strategy underwent implementation on a 118-node distribution system using GAMS. Results demonstrate that the proposed concept reduces Forced Load Shedding (FLS) by 32.04% and self-healing costs by 17.48% through effective utilization of smart prosumers' flexible capacities.

Grid-interactive efficient buildings are regarded as a promising approach to advance the role buildings can play in energy system operations and planning. This paper evaluates the demand flexibility in a residential building located in Karlsruhe, Germany, incorporating multiple distributed energy resources, including a photovoltaic and battery system, an electric vehicle, an electric water heater and a heat pump.

However, there is limited understanding of how these systems perform over a range of building stock conditions that will evolve with future efficiency and electrification trends, posing challenges for identifying optimal electric resiliency investments. This study quantifies how residential energy consumption impacts the capability of PVESS to provide home backup power during long-duration power interruptions. We model statistically representative distributions of the residential building stock and estimate storage sizes required to provide backup power as a series of building envelope efficiency, load flexibility, and electrification measures are applied. For the baseline building stock, median storage size requirements range from 10 kWh in temperate weather conditions to 90 kWh in hot climates for a 3-day power interruption. Applying energy efficiency and temperature set-point adjustments reduce storage size requirements by 2–45 kWh (16%–53 %). In hot locations, heat pump retrofits reduce median storage sizing by an additional 10–30 kWh while in cold locations, they drive 10–50 kWh of storage capacity increase. Our results suggest that bi-directional EV charging may be essential to enabling PVESS backup of heating and cooling, given their typically large kWh sizes. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.energy.2024.132180,2024,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2024.132180,15,high

Therefore, it is imperative to accelerate the construction of related facilities for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS). However, the unplanned and random location of EVCS can result in high investment costs, prolonged user queuing times, and a decrease in grid stability.

Considering uncertainties, which are associated with solar irradiance and wind speed, can increase the ability to achieve proper energy management. In addition to that, considering the smart grid's role in the electricity market as a price maker and the unpredictable behavior of EVs, these considerations aim to minimize costs and maximize profits for microgrids. The main contribution of this paper is studying the impact of increasing the charging tariff of EVs in the presence of different types of RERs on charging behavior, maximizing the profit of the microgrid, and reducing the total energy purchased from the wholesale market. For this purpose, a metaheuristic-based optimization problem called Gorilla Troops optimizer (GTO) is employed to optimally allocate the RERs and the EV charging stations. The results demonstrate that increasing the charging tariff without RERs or with only one source of RERs results in the charging of EVs following an uncontrollable strategy. Hence, the cost of purchasing energy from the utility increases. On the other hand, compared to the base case, integrating EV charging stations with multi- type RERs resulted in the profit increasing by 61.92 % and the total energy purchased from the wholesale market decreasing by 24.98 %. Moreover, the waiting time at the charging station will be reduced shortly; the annual installment of multi- type RERs decreased by 31.25 % compared with considering only one source of RERs, and the charging strategy of EVs followed the controllable charging strategy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.est.2024.112908,2024,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2024.112908,15,high

Existing charging stations often encounter issues such as unstable PV power generation and dependence on grid stability, which can interrupt the EV charging process during grid faults. Additionally, PV arrays are typically designed to extract maximum power, leading to over-current or over-voltage situations that compromise the safety of the charging infrastructure and the EV. Furthermore, these systems often require multiple power electronics converters, increasing complexity and costs while reducing overall system efficiency. To overcome these limitations, the proposed algorithm dynamically switches between on-grid and off-grid modes based on real-time weather conditions, grid availability, and the state of charge of the battery electric vehicle (BEV). This approach maximizes PV power utilization, minimizes grid dependency, and enhances BEV charging performance while prioritizing EV safety and ensuring an uninterrupted power supply. It also provides flexibility in BEV power sizing, optimizing the use of power electronics converters to reduce costs and complexity. Two distinct operating modes, adaptive charging and fast charging, are introduced, each integrated with dedicated model predictive controllers (MPC) to achieve specific control objectives. Semi-experimental simulations using a process-in-the-loop (PIL) test approach with the embedded board eZdsp TMS320F28335 demonstrate that the station manager significantly improves performance over conventional methods under various irradiance levels. Moreover, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MPC-based approach over traditional controllers such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) in different charging modes.

maybe,,A hybrid evolutionary and machine learning approach for smart building: Sustainable building energy management design,"Household energy usage can be actively managed by home users through the smart grid, utilizing the Home Energy Management (HEM) system. Within the framework of a demand response program, the HEM system adjusts the ON/OFF states and operations of household devices to minimize energy costs and peak loads. This involves addressing a constrained multi-objective optimization problem that includes integer decision parameters. Two deficiencies exist in current methods for scheduling domestic device operation. Firstly, user satisfaction is often overlooked, and secondly, there is a lack of an effective global optimization algorithm to solve the problem. In this study, the optimization of domestic appliance planning in the HEM system is conceptualized as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, employing the Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA). Ten different case studies are conducted to determine the optimal planning of devices based on various demand response programs. Two smart houses, each with 10 and 11 devices, including electric vehicles as significant domestic loads, are considered. To accurately estimate the total load demand, a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed for predicting smart building load demand. The system's validity and model performance are assessed by applying results to the digital twin of the smart building and later to the real test system. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional algorithms such as WOA, PSO, DEA, and dragonfly algorithms. The paper thoroughly explores the impact of weight factors on houses' optimal energy costs and user satisfaction within the suggested multi-objective approach. © 2024",10.1016/j.seta.2024.103709,2024,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.seta.2024.103709,15,high

In addition, the literature review shows that a research gap exists regarding a clustering-based method to optimize the allocation of DGs and EVCSs, considering the system uncertainties. This article tries to fill such a knowledge gap by proposing a new clustering-based method to optimize the allocation of DGs and EVs simultaneously, considering the uncertainties of EV behaviours and stochastic behaviours of renewable DGs. Developing a new stochastic model for EVs using the clustering algorithm is one of the essential contributions. The uncertain parameters, e.g. EV charging loads based on EV owners’ behaviours (arrival time, departure time, and driving distance) and renewable DGs, would be clustered. The proposed method could solve the execution time challenges of Monte Carlo simulation-based approaches to concern the stochastic behaviours of smart grids. The simultaneously reliability-oriented optimal allocation of EVCSs, DGs, and protection equipment, using the proposed clustering-based algorithm is another main contribution.

maybe,,Collaborative strategy for electric vehicle charging scheduling and route planning,"Due to varying energy demands and supply levels in different regions, the distribution of power load exhibits an imbalanced state. It contributes to increased power loss and poses a threat to the security constraints of the electrical grid. Simultaneously, the global energy transition has led to a continuous increase in the proportion of renewable energy integrated into the grid. Electric vehicles (EVs), serving as representative of renewable energy, further magnify this load imbalance with their charging requirements, which poses a significant challenge to the stable operation of the grid. Therefore, to ensure the smooth operation of the grid under the context of renewable energy integration, the authors investigate the coordinated strategies of EV charging scheduling and route planning. The authors first model the coupling of the transportation network with the smart grid as a cyber-physical system. Subsequently, the authors simulate and analyse the daily charging load curve of the network, capturing the travel characteristics of EVs. Based on this, the authors research the EV charging scheduling in both individual and collective travel scenarios during peak and off-peak hours. For the off-peak travel period of EVs, a charging schedule strategy based on travel plans is proposed, which reduces the time cost of EV owners' travel. Furthermore, for the collective travel of a large number of EVs within the system, a multi-EV charging scheduling strategy based on charging station load balancing is presented. This strategy effectively balances the load levels of various charging stations while reducing the overall system travel time. Ultimately, through experimental results, the authors demonstrate that by deploying appropriate charging scheduling strategies, EVs cease to be a burden on the grid and can be transformed into tools for balancing the loads across different regions. © 2024 The Authors.

However, a major challenge in EV charging is optimal day-ahead charging planning under time-varying conditions, such as fluctuating charging prices and traffic conditions. Additionally, these conditions can lead to uncertain energy consumption while driving an EV. Predicting the energy consumption of an electric vehicle is complicated because it is influenced by more factors than a typical battery, such as driving habits and traffic conditions. This paper proposes an optimal EV charging planning strategy using an artificial intelligence-based energy consumption prediction model to address this problem. The energy consumption prediction model, based on long short-term memory (LSTM), was developed and validated against other artificial intelligence models. The LSTM-based model uses real-time training, making it suitable for uncertain scenarios encountered by EVs. The predicted results and traffic information are considered as weight factors in solving the EV charging planning and routing optimization problem. The optimization problem is formulated as mixed integer linear programming. Simulation studies under various driving and traffic conditions validate the proposed optimal charging planning and routing method.

The global transition towards sustainable transportation indicates an increase in new-generation vehicles, including both fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that will take on roads in the future. This change requires new-generation stations to support electrification. This study introduced a prominent multi-energy system concept with a hydrogen refueling station. The proposed multi-energy system (MES) consists of green hydrogen production, a hydrogen refueling station for FCEVs, hydrogen injection into natural gas (NG), and a charging station for PEVs. An on-site renewable system projected at the station and a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer (PEM) to produce hydrogen for two significant consumers support MES. In addition, the MES offers the ability to conduct two-way trade with the grid if renewable energy systems are insufficient. This study develops a comprehensive multi-energy system with an economically optimized energy management model using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. The determinative datasets of vehicles are generated in a Python environment using Gauss distribution. The fleet of FCEVs and PEVs are currently available on the market. The study includes fleets of the most common models from well-known brands. The results indicate that profits increase when the storage capacity of the hydrogen tank is higher and natural gas injections are limitless. Optimization results for all cases tend to choose higher-priced natural gas injections over hydrogen refueling because of the difference in costs of refueling and injection expenses.

Based on these planning results, in the lower level, an operational planning model is established to optimize the charging power of the EVs in the CSs and the operation strategy of the MESVs. The outputs of the lower-level model are fed back to the upper level to update the planning result. This process iteratively proceeds until convergence. Business models are established for the MESVs in working days and holidays separately to accommodate the CSs in serving the EV charging demand of the highway and support the interaction between the CSs and the grid.

Nowadays, the limited public chargers are commonly occupied by vehicles which have already been fully charged. Such phenomenon, known as overstay, hinders other vehicles’ accessibility to charging resources. In this paper, we analyze a charging facility innovation to tackle the challenge of overstay, leveraging the idea of Robo-chargers - automated chargers that can rotate in a charging station and proactively plug or unplug plug-in electric vehicles. We formalize an operation model for stations incorporating Fixed-chargers and Robo-chargers. Optimal scheduling can be solved with the recognition of the combinatorial nature of vehicle-charger assignments, charging dynamics, and customer waiting behaviors. Then, with operation model nested, we develop a planning model to guide economical investment on both types of chargers so that the total cost of ownership is minimized. In the planning phase, it further considers charging demand variances and service capacity requirements. In this paper, we provide systematic techno-economical methods to evaluate if introducing Robo-chargers is beneficial given a specific application scenario.

The scope of this work is to create a prototype and show a different approach to assessing the number of inlets required on highways. The proposed method estimates the energy requirements for the future electric fleet on highways. It is based on an energy conversion that starts with the fuel sold in the highway network and ends with the number of charging inlets. A proposed benchmark method estimates energy requirements for the electric fleet using consolidated values and statistics about refueling attitudes, with factors for range correction and winter conditions. The results depend on assumptions about future car distribution, with varying numbers of required inlets.

The lack of sufficient numbers of CPs has hindered EV adoption and negatively impacted the progress of sustainable mobility. We propose a CP distribution algorithm that is machine learning-based and leverages population density, points of interest (POIs), and the most used roads as input parameters to determine the best locations for deploying CPs. The objects of the following research are as follows: (1) to allocate weights to the three parameters in a 6 km by 10 km grid size scenario in Dublin in Ireland so that the best CP distribution is obtained; (2) to use a feedforward neural network (FNNs) model to predict the best parameter weight combinations and the corresponding CPs. CP deployment solutions are classified as successful when an EV is located within 100 m of a CP at the end of a trip. We find that (1) integrating the GEECharge and EV Portacharge algorithms with FNNs optimises the distribution of CPs; (2) the normalised optimal weights for the population density, POIs, and most used road parameters determined by this approach result in approximately 109 CPs being allocated in Dublin; (3) resizing the grid from 6 km by 10 km to 10 km by 6 km and rotating it at an angle of (Formula presented.) results in a 5.7% rise in the overall number of CPs in Dublin; (4) reducing the grid cell size from 1 km2 to 500 m2 reduces the mean distance between CPs and the EVs.

Considering uncertainties, which are associated with solar irradiance and wind speed, can increase the ability to achieve proper energy management. In addition to that, considering the smart grid's role in the electricity market as a price maker and the unpredictable behavior of EVs, these considerations aim to minimize costs and maximize profits for microgrids. The main contribution of this paper is studying the impact of increasing the charging tariff of EVs in the presence of different types of RERs on charging behavior, maximizing the profit of the microgrid, and reducing the total energy purchased from the wholesale market.

Two smart houses, each with 10 and 11 devices, including electric vehicles as significant domestic loads, are considered. To accurately estimate the total load demand, a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed for predicting smart building load demand. The system's validity and model performance are assessed by applying results to the digital twin of the smart building and later to the real test system. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional algorithms such as WOA, PSO, DEA, and dragonfly algorithms.

The article presents an innovative technique employing multiple-agent deeper Q-Networking (MADQN) to coordinate electric automobiles and improve the electricity system balance of load. The suggested MADQN simulation rapidly optimizes battery charge plans by utilizing the capabilities of multiple agent networks as well as deeper reinforced learning. The framework adjusts to current network situations utilizing cooperative decision-making between substances, considering variables like a need for power, accessibility to green energy sources, and protection of the arrangement. Beneficial load distribution is made possible when reducing expenses and ecological damage because of the system's capacity to gather data from and modify intricate, changing circumstances.

maybe,,Securing Raw Materials for the Transformation; Rohstoffe für die Transformationen sichern,"Against the backdrop of diverse and overlapping transformations in Germany, such as the energy transition, electromobility, digital-ization, climate change and the green transformation as a whole, secure access to high-tech raw materials is of central importance. It is also important to maintain the innovative strength and com-petitiveness of German industry and to upgrade the infrastructure for the future. In the coming decades, this will require the conver-sion of infrastructure in step with the expansion of energy generation capacities, the expansion of power lines and grids, charging infrastructure, storage, fiber optic and hydrogen networks. By 2045, primary energy and electricity will be generated almost entirely from renewable sources and greenhouse gas neutral-ity will be achieved. By then, coal and gas-fired power stations will have been largely replaced by wind and solar power, petrol and diesel cars will have been replaced by electric vehicles and smart grids and controllable loads will ensure that generation, storage and consumption are optimally coordinated. In short, in two decades’ time the energy system will be made up of very different systems and facilities and will use different forms of energy than today. © 2024, Bergbau-Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH.

maybe,,Optimal electric vehicles charging scheduling for energy and reserve markets considering wind uncertainty and generator contingency,"Decarburization of electrical systems encourage high wind power into electric power systems and the electrification of transport sectors through electric vehicles (EVs). The increasing penetration of uncertain wind power generation and transportation networks via EV charging stations has introduced challenges for system operators to manage power systems and market operations. In this context, this paper presents a stochastic AC security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model to clear day-ahead energy and reserve markets considering transportation–electricity networks through EV charging stations in the presence of uncertain wind power and generator contingency. Pre-contingency ranking is a common strategy for reducing the time of the SCUC problem, but it provides high-impact outages. To address this issue, generator outages ranked first are identified using the post-contingency generator response ranking approach. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a structure with the most effective outages in the presence of uncertain wind power and transportation networks. The stochastic optimization approach is modeled through scenarios with corresponding probabilities to manage the wind uncertainty. The computationally complex proposed model is solved by a prominent bender decomposition approach. Case studies are shown on a modified IEEE 118-bus system with 26 nodes and 74 connected links of the electricity transportation network. The results show that optimal EV travel scheduling can optimize the transportation network and a sufficient energy reserve, confirming the security of the power system with minimum operating cost. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1002/er.7446,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1002/er.7446,15,high
maybe,,Optimal sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems by considering power sharing and electric vehicles,"Currently, the ideal sizing of hybrid technologies is one of the vital aspects of power system design. In this article, the design and optimization of the sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) with power-sharing capabilities in conjunction with electric vehicles (EVs) were proposed in two case studies. Two algorithms, namely, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and multi-objective crow search (MOCS), have been formulated and were used to solve the problem being investigated. In case study 1 (CS1), four different HRESs are designed in the presence of EVs, meaning that for each HRES an EV and the power-sharing capability is employed. And also, the stochastic behavior of the EV using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is modeled. In case study 2 (CS2), four HRESs are designed with power-sharing capabilities, but in this case, for any of the HRESs, EV is not considered. This idea can be considered a novel breakthrough for the potential of power-sharing has been incorporated with the integration of EVs and HRESs. This approach improves the life cycle cost and loss of power supply probability indices. In summary, both cases in the presence and absence of EVs were compared with the simulation results. The results show that the use of the proposed EV significantly reduces the total cost of the engineered system. Furthermore, two meta-heuristic techniques were compared, and it was concluded that MOPSO had performed better than MOCS.

maybe,,Simultaneous allocation of EV charging stations and renewable energy sources: An Elite RERNN-m2MPA approach,"This article proposes a hybrid optimization technique for optimal location and sizing of electric vehicle fast charging stations (EVFCSs) and renewable energy sources (RESs). The proposed hybrid optimization technique is the consolidation of recalling-enhanced recurrent neural network (RERNN) and Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), hence it is called RERNN-m2MPA technique. Here, an enhanced MPA (m2MPA) is proposed. The major objective of this article is to energy loss reduction, voltage deviation of the power system network and minimization of the land cost with maximum weightage to serve maximum EV with minimum installation cost. The lessening of voltage deviation is considered as objective function to maintain a stable voltage profile in every nodes. The land cost is diminished with weightage maximization to serve maximal electric vehicle with minimal installation cost of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS). In this proposal, optimal location with capacity of fast charging stations and RESs are determined concurrently, while determined the deviation paths and uncertainties of RESs. To this intention, RERNN is proposed to cover the charging demand for EVs on the transportation network. Moreover, an m2MPA is proposed to optimal allocation of RESs and fast charging stations with respect to the distribution and transportation networks. Likewise, the proposed technique minimizes the adverse effects of fast charging demand on the grid, particularly during peak periods reducing the need for larger capabilities of energy storage units to absorb fast charging fluctuations and reduces the need for separate FCS installation. By then, the proposed technique is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink platform, its performance is compared with various existing techniques. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1002/er.7780,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1002/er.7780,15,high
maybe,,Prediction of electric vehicle charging duration time using ensemble machine learning algorithm and Shapley additive explanations,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most important components of smart transportation systems. Limited driving range, prolonged charging times, and inadequate charging infrastructure are the key barriers to EV adoption. To address the problem of prolonged charging time, the simple approach of developing a new charging station to enhance the charging capacity may not work due to the limitation of physical space and strain on power grids. Prediction of precise EV charging time can assist the drivers in effective planning of their trips to alleviate range anxiety during trips. Therefore, this study employed four different ensemble machine learning (EML) algorithms: random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), categorical boosting, and light gradient boosting machine, for predicting EVs' charging time. The prediction experiments were based on 2 years of real-world charging event data from 500 EVs in Japan's private and commercial vehicles. The study emphasized predicting charging time for different charging modes, that is, normal and fast charging operations. The results indicate that EML models performed well under various scenarios, with the XGBoost model having the highest accuracy. Moreover, we also employ the newly developed Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) approach to tackle the non-interpretability issues of the ML algorithm by interpreting the XGBoost model outputs. The obtained SHAP value plots demonstrated the nonlinear relationship between explanatory variables and EV charging time. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1002/er.8219,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1002/er.8219,15,high
maybe,,Uncovering travel and charging patterns of private electric vehicles with trajectory data: evidence and policy implications,"The market penetration rate of electric vehicle (EV) is on the rise globally. However, the use behaviors of private EVs have not been well understood, in part due to the lack of proper datasets. This paper used a unique dataset containing trajectories of over 76,000 private EVs (accounting for 68% of the private EV fleet) in Beijing to uncover trip, parking and charging patterns of private EVs, so as to better inform policy making and infrastructure planning for different EV-related stakeholders, including planners, vehicle manufacturers, and power grid and infrastructure companies. We conducted both statistical and spatiotemporal analyses. In terms of statistical patterns, most of the EV trip distances (over 71%) were shorter than 15 km. Also, most of parking events (around 76%) lasted for less than 1 h. From a spatial perspective, the densities of trip Origins and Destinations (ODs), parking events and charging events in the central districts tended to be much higher than those of the other districts. Furthermore, the number of intra-district trips tended to be much higher than the number of inter-district trips. In terms of temporal trip patterns, there were two peak periods on working days: a morning peak period from 7 to 9 AM, and an afternoon peak period from 5 to 7 PM; On non-working days, there was only one peak period from 9 AM to 5 PM; while the temporal charging patterns on working and non-working days had a similar trend: most of EV drivers got their EVs charged overnight. Finally, we demonstrated how to apply the observed statistical and spatiotemporal patterns into policy making (i.e., time-of-use tariff) and infrastructure planning (i.e., deployment of normal charging posts, enroute fast charging stations and vehicle-to-grid enabled infrastructures). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11116-021-10216-1,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s11116-021-10216-1,15,high

The existing grid infrastructure is required to be modified and upgraded as a result of the increasing integration of the renewables and new generation consumers where the availability of the existing networks has to be analyzed for integration as well. In order to keep the grid stable and integrate the renewables to the grid optimally, necessary analyses have to be realized including the investigation of the optimal integration criteria. During the integration phase of the new generation consumers and producers, two ways power flows and variable power production of renewables have to be considered for system design. In this study, analysis for optimal sizing and integration studies are performed for electric vehicle parking lot and solar power plants located on the campus distribution network considering optimal sizing criteria and the aim of stabilization of voltage regulation during day time operation of solar power plant and random charging profile of electric vehicles.

maybe,,Strategic network expansion planning with electric vehicle smart charging concepts as investment options,"The electrification of transport seems inevitable as part of global decarbonization efforts, but power system integration of electric vehicles faces numerous challenges, including a disproportionately high demand peak necessitating expensive infrastructure investments. Moreover, long-term developments in the power sector are characterized by great uncertainty, which increases the risk of making incorrect investment decisions leading to stranded assets. A cost-effective system integration of electrified transport would therefore not be possible without the implementation of smart charging concepts in combination with strategic network expansion planning that considers the impact of uncertainties. This paper proposes investment and operation models of Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V), Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), and Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) for the large-scale and long-term network expansion planning problem under multi-dimensional uncertainty. Additionally, it presents a multi-stage stochastic planning framework that can identify optimal investment strategies such that the expected system cost is minimized and the risk of stranded investments is reduced. The models are demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus test system and applied in a case study of the power system of Great Britain. The results highlight G2V, V2G and V2B as effective non-network alternatives to conventional reinforcement that could generate substantial economic savings and act as hedging instruments against uncertainty. For the case of Great Britain, the Option Values of G2V, V2G, and V2B could amount to £1.2bn, £10.8bn, and £10.1bn, respectively, over a 40-year horizon. Although the quantified values are system-specific, the paper presents key observations on the role of smart charging concepts as investment options that can be generalized for any low-carbon power system. © 2021",10.1016/j.adapen.2021.100077,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.adapen.2021.100077,15,high
maybe,,Optimal PV-EV sizing at solar powered workplace charging stations with smart charging schemes considering self-consumption and self-sufficiency balance,"The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems and electric vehicles (EVs) in the built environment, including at workplaces, has increased significantly in the recent decade and has posed new technical challenges for the power system, such as increased peak loads and component overloading. Several studies show that improved matching between PV generation and EV load through both optimal sizing and operation of PV-EV systems can minimize these challenges. This paper presents an optimal PV-EV sizing framework for workplace solar powered charging stations considering load matching performances. The proposed optimal sizing framework in this study uses a novel score, called self-consumption-sufficiency balance (SCSB), which conveys the balance between self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS), based on a similar principle as the F1-score in machine learning. A high SCSB score implies that the system is close to being self-sufficient without exporting or curtailing a large share of local production. The results show that the SCSB performance tends to be higher with a larger combined PV-EV size. In addition to presenting PV-EV optimal sizing at the workplace charging station, this study also assesses a potential SC and SS enhancement with optimal operation through smart charging schemes. The results show that smart charging schemes can significantly improve the load matching performances by up to 42.6 and 40.8 percentage points for SC and SS, respectively. The smart charging scheme will also shift the combined optimal PV-EV sizes. Due to its simplicity and universality, the optimal sizing based on SCSB score proposed in this study can be a benchmark for future studies on optimal sizing of PV-EV system, or distributed generation-load in general. © 2021 The Authors",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118139,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118139,15,high
maybe,,3D-PV-Locator: Large-scale detection of rooftop-mounted photovoltaic systems in 3D,"While photovoltaic (PV) systems are being installed at an unprecedented rate, it is challenging to keep track of them due to their decentralized character and large number. In this paper, we present the 3D-PV-Locator for large-scale detection of roof-mounted PV systems in three dimensions (3D). The 3D-PV-Locator combines information extracted from aerial images and 3D building data by means of deep neural networks for image classification and segmentation, as well as 3D spatial data processing techniques. It thereby extends existing approaches for the automated detection of PV systems from aerial images by also providing their azimuth and tilt angles. We evaluate the 3D-PV-Locator using a large dataset gathered from the official German PV registry in a real-world study with more than one million buildings. In terms of azimuth and tilt angles, our evaluation shows that the 3D-PV-Locator and the official registry coincide for about two thirds of the observations and are within neighboring classes for 84 and 99 percent of the observations, respectively. In terms of detected PV system capacity, we show that the 3D-PV-Locator clearly outperforms existing approaches. It performs particularly well for the groups of small and medium-sized PV systems (3.6–33.1 percent error reduction) and PV systems tilted beyond 40° (25.6–38.1 percent error reduction). The 3D PV system data generated by the 3D-PV-Locator can inform several practical applications, such as improved forecasting of solar generation, the optimized planning and operation of distribution networks, improved integration of electric vehicles, and others.

maybe,,Nuclear fleet flexibility: Modeling and impacts on power systems with renewable energy,"This paper identifies the underlying physical mechanisms that frame the flexibility and operation of nuclear technologies, with analysis focused on the effects of two structural characteristics of nuclear fleets, i.e. nuclear schedule optimization and minimal power variations, on simplified French power system simulations. We develop a method to simulate nuclear schedule optimization to reflect how plant managers maximize plant availability during peak-demand periods. Using this schedule optimization, we compute each plant's minimum power level and its variation over time to evaluate the flexibility potential. Three nuclear flexibility hypotheses are considered: one where fleet schedule is considered constant, which is standard practice in the energy systems modeling literature, one with an optimized fleet schedule with constant minimum power, and one with an optimized fleet schedule with physics-induced minimum power variations. Sensitivity analysis highlights the links between the fleet's schedule optimization, minimal power variations, relative share of nuclear and renewables in the capacity mix, and results of simulation models. We find that the nuclear fleet's optimization and associated realistic minimum power variations gain in importance with increasing relative share of nuclear in the capacity mix. The schedule's importance holds as renewables' installed capacities heighten as the residual demand level decreases. This paper highlights the potential benefits of modeling nuclear schedule optimizations and the resulting minimum power evolutions. Both aspects are crucial for evaluating nuclear flexibility characteristics in simplified low-carbon electric systems that use a significant share of renewable energy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118903,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118903,15,high
maybe,,Energy sharing and trading on a novel spatiotemporal energy network in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area,"Spatiotemporal energy network with smart transportations for energy sharing can address regional imbalance distribution of renewable resources, dynamic intermittence and fluctuation of renewable power supply, enhance grid independence, or even provide voltage/power stabilization services to local power grids. Furthermore, difference in regional energy pricing policy can be fully utilised to economically incentivise participation willingness of stakeholders. However, the current literature provides few studies and little knowledge on the topic. In this study, a spatiotemporal energy network in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area was proposed for regional energy balance with different types of buildings in demand-shortage and renewable-abundant regions, and electric vehicles for daily commuting. Roles of electricity-powered vehicles include renewable charging for clean transportation through Building-to-Vehicle (B2V) interaction, spatiotemporal energy sharing through Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) interaction, voltage/power stabilization of local grids through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) interaction. Techno-economic-environmental potentials of the proposed spatiotemporal energy network are evaluated for carbon neutrality transition. Advanced energy pricing policy and energy interaction modes are identified, based on dynamic energy trading and associated cost, among building owners, vehicle owners, and utility companies of power grids. Economic analysis and decision-making on multi-stakeholders are analysed, including external cost with power grids, internal cost, and battery degradation cost. Results showed that the proposed spatiotemporal energy network with the V2G interaction mode can improve the renewable penetration ratio from 0.7 to 0.722, the demand coverage ratio from 0.021 to 0.039, with the decrease in equivalent CO<inf>2</inf> emission from 5.04x106 to 4.78x106 kg by 5.2%, and annual import cost from 8.16x106 to 8.0x106 HK$ by 2.0%. However, compared to the isolated system, the spatiotemporal energy network will lead to the increase of battery degradation cost from 0.594x105 to 0.688x105 HK$, by 15.8%, due to the increase in battery charging/discharging cycles. In order to economically incentivise participation willingness of all stakeholders, advanced energy pricing policy and energy interaction modes are identified as Policy 5 and V2G interaction mode, under which vehicles can increase the internal trading cost from 0 to 1.78x105 HK$, overwhelming its battery depreciation cost at 0.688 x105 HK$.

maybe,,Integrated multi-stage and multi-zone distribution network expansion planning with renewable energy sources and hydrogen refuelling stations for fuel cell vehicles,"In line with the growing pressures on implementing zero-carbon emission policies and the implementation of hydrogen in the transport sector, energy markets are experiencing inevitable transformation and interactions. Since fuel cell electric vehicles have been attracting considerable attention, the production and supply of renewable hydrogen through hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs) are of great importance. The growing energy demand, inappropriate siting and sizing of HRSs, and high penetration of distributed renewable energy sources (RESs) make power distribution network planning very challenging. This paper proposes an integrated multi-stage and multi-zone expansion planning framework to coordinate the investment and scheduling of HRSs, wind and solar energy sources, and the distribution network. To model the green HRSs, water electrolysers powered by renewable electricity and storage tanks to locally produce and store hydrogen are suggested. The objective of the proposed problem is to minimise the investment, operation, emissions, and maintenance costs of network's assets, RESs, and HRSs. The RESs expansion scheme comprises the installation of two different groups; the former pertains to distributed renewable sources installed over the network while the latter is integrated into HRSs. Case studies are conducted on 6-node and real Australian 100-node distribution networks. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of optimal timing, sizing, location, and operational schedules of HRSs, RESs, and distribution network's assets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119242,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119242,15,high
maybe,,Quantifying the real-time energy flexibility of commuter plug-in electric vehicles in an office building considering photovoltaic and load uncertainty,"The widespread use of fluctuating renewable electricity has introduced challenges in balancing power systems. This can be alleviated by using flexible resources on the demand side to provide ancillary services at various timescales (e.g., day-ahead planning or real-time operation). However, practitioners lack a unified framework for measuring energy flexibility in the real-time operation frame. This study considers a control structure for clustered commuter plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in an office building with both day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch and proposes a generic quantification framework for assessing the capability of PEVs to manage the uncertainties of photovoltaic output and inflexible building load. Our evaluation considered the flexibility shortage in terms of power, energy, and control strategy, and the Monte Carlo method was used for probabilistic analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify the key factors determining real-time flexibility. The results suggest that 1.5–2 times the number of PEVs is required to meet the defined level of real-time flexibility rather than planning flexibility. Possible conflicts in flexibility enhancement at different timescales and directions were observed under various day-ahead scheduling strategies; prediction information can be used to mitigate conflicts in scheduling strategies and improve the overall control performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119365,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119365,15,high
maybe,,An optimization planning framework for allocating multiple distributed energy resources and electric vehicle charging stations in distribution networks,"In developing a sustainable and efficient power systems network while reducing carbon footprint, renewable energy (RE)-based Distribution Generation (DG) units are highly recommended. Furthermore, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and other passive electronic units are adopted to improve grid performance and mitigate the effects of high variability from RE power. Hence, planning frameworks are developed to optimally allocate these units to distribution networks. However, current planning mechanisms do not consider the relative effect of different allocated units in planning frameworks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel comprehensive planning framework for allocating DG units, BESS units, and Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) facilities in a distribution network while optimizing its technical, economic, and environmental benefits. The proposed framework uses a recombination technique to generate more solutions by dynamically updating the DG and BESS units’ locations in one iteration. A Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based algorithm is introduced to coordinate EV charging that suggests the optimal EVCS location in relation to other units’ locations. To cope with the complexity ensuing from searching a larger solution space, a multi-stage, hybrid optimization scheme is developed to produce optimal allocation variables. A category-based multiobjective framework is further developed to simultaneously optimize many objective functions — power loss, voltage stability, voltage deviation, installation and operation cost, and emission cost. Through numerical simulations on the IEEE 33- and 118-bus distribution network, it is shown that the proposed optimization scheme achieves higher metric values than the adopted benchmark optimization schemes. A validation process was also carried out on the proposed multiobjective optimization approach, comparing it with other approaches. Using the Spacing metric, the proposed approach proves to be efficient, depicting a good spread of Pareto optimal solutions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119513,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119513,15,high

However, with the increase of the number and scale of EVCS, the economic problems of EVCS operation are becoming more and more prominent, and there are many problems in their operation, all of which affect the economic and social benefits of EVCS. In order to improve the economic operation of EVCS, this paper adopts Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-Interpretative Structural Modeling (DEMATEL-ISM) method to identify and analyse its influencing factors. According to the opinions of experts and EVCS enterprises, the influencing factors system of economic operation of EVCS is constructed by Delphi method, including four aspects of planning, external environment, management and technology. Based on the analysis results of multilevel hierarchical structure model, the influencing factors of EVCS economic operation can be divided into four levels. Among them, the top-level factors include charging price, gasoline price, electric vehicle battery, reliability of power supply, and spare parts management. The factors in the second layer include charging monitoring system and safety management. The third level factors include charging station address, charging station scale, regional power grid situation, government policy, technical supervision management, operation data analysis and management, personal training management. The third level elements directly affect the second level factors and have an impact on the first level factors through the second level factors. Furthermore, it is also found that the number of electric vehicles is the deepest factor and the most basic segment which affects the economic operation of EVCS and the other factors.

maybe,,Bi-level planning and scheduling of electric vehicle charging stations for peak shaving and congestion management in low voltage distribution networks,"Most existing algorithms for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) planning and scheduling of electric vehicles (EVs) do not consider the uncertain behavior of EVs and distribution networks, including the EV arrival and departure times, user driving needs, and realistic residential load and generation profiles. This paper proposes a bi-level planning and operation framework that determines the optimal locations of EVCS and scheduling of EVs to reduce peak load and network congestion in low voltage distribution networks by considering uncertain EV and distribution network behavior. Planning of EVCS is performed to minimize voltage deviations and distribution network losses. The priority-based scheduling algorithm uses the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) technology to charge the EVs during high priority periods to meet the user requirements and discharge during low or medium priority periods to reduce the peak load and thermal overloading in distribution feeders. Based on an Australian scenario, the proposed method has been tested on the IEEE low voltage test feeder. Uncoordinated scheduling of EVs is also implemented and compared with the proposed strategy. The results show that installing EVCS at the optimal locations can reduce the network losses and voltage deviations by 39.38 per cent and 15.32 per cent, respectively. It is also shown that the proposed scheduling of EVs can reduce the peak load of distribution substations and lower the network congestion without affecting the EV charging requirements.

maybe,,Optimal sizing of country-scale renewable energy systems towards green transportation sector in developing countries,"In the context of refining countries' transition plans toward 100% shares of renewable systems in the electric power grids by 2050, this study aims to investigate, for the first time, the potential of covering the increasing energy demand for electric vehicles (EVs) using the previously planned hybrid renewable energy system (RES) for Jordan, which comprised wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), and battery energy storage systems (ESS). The optimal RES sizing is revisited to examine the influence of EV penetration percentages and charging rates (normal, medium, and fast) and optimize the charging periods to reduce system capacity. The results showed that for typical nighttime charging and relatively smaller EV penetrations, the RES system capacity remains the same, but the size of ESS must be increased by up to 16.67% for 25% EV penetration. As EV penetration increases, the required ESS capacity drops slightly, but the RES capacity increases by up to 24.53% for 100% EV penetration. Optimal charging periods were found to be during morning hours (6:00 to 9:00 a.m.). Adopting these early charging hours and compared to 0% EV, the required ESS capacity remained nearly the same, except for smaller EV penetration percentages. However, for 100% EV penetration, the increase in required capacity ranged from 24.5% for fast charging to 50.01% for normal charging. For lower penetration percentages, the three modes of charging resulted in comparable capacities of ESS and RES. As the penetration percentage increased to 100%, the fast charging mode required considerably lower RES capacity (by 17.0%) and the same ESS capacity of the 0% EV penetration. © 2022 The Authors.",10.1016/j.csite.2022.102442,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.csite.2022.102442,15,high
maybe,,Multi-time scale electric vehicle charging load forecasting considering constant current charging and parallel computing,"At present, the concept of ecological civilization has been widely recognized by the whole world, and a series of policies that guarantees the evolution of the electric vehicle (EV) industry has been implemented by multiple countries. Therefore, it is significant to predict the charging load of EVs to solve the challenges of power system planning and operation. The Monte Carlo (MC) method is preferred by many scholars in EV charging load prediction because it is very suitable for describing random characteristics with a good prediction effect. To obtain more reliable and efficient prediction results, this paper analyzes the application of parallel computing technology in MC simulation. Firstly, EVs in the region are classified according to their battery capacity. Based on the voltage change curve of lithium-ion power batteries in the process of constant current charging under different capacities, the charging power, charging time, and state of charge (SOC) of EVs are investigated. Secondly, the behavior characteristics of users and the driving parameter characteristics of EVs are studied respectively, and the probability distribution model of multi-source information is established. Thirdly, parallel computing technology in the computer field is introduced, and an improved MC method is proposed based on the multi-core CPU architecture. After fully considering the complex constant current charging process after fitting, the charging load of EVs in a region of East China is simulated. Finally, the time cost and the load forecasting results of serial and parallel methods are compared and analyzed, and the progressiveness and effectiveness of the parallel method are verified. Results show that the charging load has four peaks in a day, taxis are the main source of the peak load of the power grid, the charging load of buses fluctuates the most, and private cars are the main backup capacity to participate in V2G dispatching in the future. In addition, under the experimental conditions set in this paper, compared with the traditional serial MC method, the improved MC method based on parallel computing shows good performance with the acceleration effect improved by 7 to 12 times. © 2022 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.egyr.2022.08.034,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2022.08.034,15,high

maybe,,A novel dynamic planning mechanism for allocating electric vehicle charging stations considering distributed generation and electronic units,"Achieving a sustainable and efficient power systems network and decarbonized environment involves the optimal allocation of multiple distributed energy resource (DERs) unit types and flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) to distribution networks. However, while the most focus is on optimization algorithms and multi-objective techniques, little to no attention is paid to the underlying mechanisms in planning frameworks. This paper goes beyond existing literature by investigating the impact of planning mechanisms in smart grid planning frameworks when considering the allocation of PV distributed generation units, battery energy storage systems, capacitor banks, and electric vehicle charging station facilities. First, a single- and multi-objective planning problem is formulated. Then, we propose a novel adaptive-dynamic planning mechanism that uses a recombination technique to find optimal allocation variables of multiple DER and FACTS types. To cope with the additional complexity resulting from the expanded solution space, we develop a hybrid stochastic optimizer, named cooperative spiral genetic algorithm with differential evolution (CoSGADE) optimization scheme, to produce optimal allocation solution variables. Through numerical simulations, it is seen that the proposed adaptive planning mechanism improves achieves a 12% and 14% improvement to the conventional sequential (multi-stage) and simultaneous mechanisms, on small to large scale distribution networks. © 2022 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.egyr.2022.10.379,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2022.10.379,15,high
maybe,,Shaving electric bills with renewables? A multi-period pinch-based methodology for energy planning,"As the energy demand keeps growing with the world's increasing population, concerns have arisen about the carbon emissions that contribute to critical environmental issues. These environmental concerns drive many nations to commit themselves in pursuing sustainable energy resources. Different process integration techniques have been developed to achieve a viable energy planning sector. In reference to the literature review, the use of time-sliced based models in optimization problems is still sparse. Hence, this paper aims to develop a time-sliced based optimization model that can be integrated into energy integration models. With that, a multi-period pinch-based methodology (targeting, scheduling, and optimization) for electric power systems with the hybridization of renewables and fossil-based energy is proposed. The prospective framework is designed to meet the emissions limit, fulfil energy demand, and minimize the electricity bill. An illustrative case study in Malaysia incorporated with an actual billing system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that it is capable of reducing the total electricity bill by 35% and achieving a 71% reduction of emissions by using solar PV as the renewables. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2021.122320,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2021.122320,15,high
maybe,,Optimal siting and sizing of electric taxi charging stations considering transportation and power system requirements,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have become more popular to address transportation-related environmental concerns. However, to integrate a massive fleet of EVs, it is crucial to properly build charging stations by considering the optimal geographical placement and number of charging spots. This task is particularly challenging for users with rigid schedules such as taxi drivers. Hence, an optimal siting and sizing approach for an electric taxi (ET) charging station is proposed in this study, considering both transportation and power system needs. In addition, particular attention to taxi drivers' needs is considered. Fixed installation costs, land costs, and trip costs are the factors evaluated in this proposed approach. A network modeling approach based on a winner-takes-all edge trimming was used to identify interest points of the city in terms of traffic flows.

maybe,,Combined PV-PEV Hosting Capacity Analysis in Low-Voltage Distribution Networks,"The increasing penetration of low and zero carbon (LZC) technologies, such as residential-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) in low-voltage (LV) distribution networks, can become highly problematic for utilities if combined PV-PEV connections exceed the hosting capacity of such networks. This is due to technical impacts caused by such LZC technologies on voltage quality, such as voltage rise, voltage drop, voltage unbalance, and on assets loading (transformer and conductors). This paper proposes a stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo simulations to estimate combined PV-PEV hosting capacity in LV networks. In addition, the proposed approach can be used to assist utility engineers to undertake planning actions based on the potential risk of violation. From the results obtained by applying the proposed approach to a real Brazilian LV network, overvoltage and unbalance voltage issues are found to be the most limiting factors of combined PV-PEV connections. Further, it is shown that the combined PV-PEV penetration levels need to be considered to avoid under or overestimations of both PV and PEV hosting capacity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.epsr.2022.107829,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2022.107829,15,high
maybe,,Estimation of Rwanda's Power System Inertia as Input for Long-term Dynamic Frequency Response Regulation Planning,"Changes in the quota between conventional generation and renewable energy sources constitute major challenges that the modern power systems have to encounter. Conventional power plants are replaced by renewable generation (e.g. wind turbines, photovoltaics) that contribute to the reduction of power system inertia. This may introduce frequency stability issues because frequency is affected by the amount of system inertia, along with the response of controllable frequency reserves and the amount of power imbalance. Therefore, the estimation and analysis of power system inertia and the frequency response assessment is essential to ensure power system stability and security. This paper proposes a novel method to estimates the inertia constant for three different periods in future, namely, 2025, 2035 and 2050 based on the produced future energy scenarios (FES) for Rwandan's power system. In addition, the paper evaluates the frequency response dynamics for each scenario. Results show that the highest progression in renewable energy resources penetration resulted to a larger reduction in the system inertia constant (from 7.2 in control area 1 to 3.83s in control area 3) and the largest frequency drop was observed during the high progression scenario in the year 2050 where the PV and imported power penetration was expected to reach more than 30% of the total installed capacity. © 2022",10.1016/j.epsr.2022.107853,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2022.107853,15,high
maybe,,Three-phase infeasibility analysis for distribution grid studies,"With the increase of distributed energy resources in the distribution grid, planning to ensure sufficient infrastructure and resources becomes critical. Planning at the distribution level is limited by the complexities of optimizing unbalanced systems. In this paper we develop a three-phase infeasibility analysis that identifies weak locations in a distribution network. This optimization is formulated by adding slack current sources at nodes in the system and minimizing their norm subject to distribution power flow constraints. Through this analysis we solve instances of power flow that would otherwise be infeasible and diverge. Under conditions when power flow is feasible, our approach is equivalent to standard three-phase power flow; however, for cases where power flow fails, the nonzero slack injection currents compensate for missing power to make the grid feasible. Since an uncountable number of injected currents can provide feasibility, we further explore the optimization formulation that best fits the solution objective through use of both a least squares and an L1 norm objective. Our L1 norm formulation localizes power deficient locations through its inherent sparsity. We show the efficacy of this approach on realistic unbalanced testcases up to 8500 nodes and for a scenario with a high penetration of electric vehicles. © 2022",10.1016/j.epsr.2022.108486,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2022.108486,15,high

In this paper, a model based non-cooperative game theory is developed to optimize the capacity configuration problem with wind power, PV power, and electric vehicles (EVs). The model is integrated with economic factors, such as electricity sales income, investments, and power supply reliability costs. An iterative search algorithm is used to solve the proposed game model, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to optimize the income of each player. Mixed integer multi-objective linear programming (MIMLP) is used to establish the representative days selection model of resources and load demands. To verify the rationality of the model, the grid-connected hybrid power generation system with different game participants and line transmission capacities was studied. Furthermore, the representative days results of the daily load rate and peak valley ratio generated by MIMLP are compared with those obtained using k-means clustering and a scenario reduction method.

At present, most studies determine EV charging needs based on user travel paths, but they have not taken the behavior uncertainty of EV owners and the diversity of their demands into account. The probability statistics on the massive data of EV travels can help excavating the travel and charging rules of the EVs. Based on user travel data, the Markov chain and the roulette method are used to simulates EV charging requirements in three scenarios considering various uncertain factors, and then a K-means clustering algorithm is used to obtain charging requirements in three scenarios. On this basis, a bi-level planning model of charging station with maximum annual profit of construction and operation and minimum comprehensive charging cost of EVs as multi-objective function is proposed. This model also considers many constraints, such as cooperative service of multi-type charging piles, acceptance capacity of distribution network and so on. The upper model takes the location and capacity of charging station planning as control variables. The lower model was established to minimize the comprehensive charging cost of EVs. The upper and lower models interact and couple with each other. The solution process of bi-level planning model was designed through using firefly algorithm.

Recent studies on battery energy storage system (BESS) evaluation, sizing and scheduling using energy management system (EMS), have focused on advanced modeling and optimization methods to maximize value streams accumulated across multiple services. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for EMS of smart home community including BESS, photovoltaic system (PV) and electrical vehicle (EV) with multiple uncertainties based on real behavior of consumers. The suggested algorithm reduces consumers cost by selecting optimal BESS sizes regarding the uncertainty of the market price, power generation of the PV, the amount of charge of the EV and the electricity of the grid. It is so crucial that all uncertainties and consumers' life style are considered to achieve accurate results by taken in to account as double apply both in BESS optimal sizing and EMS of smart home community. Genetic algorithm is used as an optimization method for solving of compatibility -based EMS problem in the community of smart homes considering controllable and uncontrollable loads, and it has been developed for three different cases: on grid, off grid, and off grid in addition to EV connected.

However, there is a lack of understanding on the environmental impacts from electric flying cars. In this study, by modeling flying processes and sizing components of flying cars, the well-to-wheel CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from electric flying cars are estimated. The results show that when assuming battery specific energy of 200 Wh/kg and grid emission factor in China's context, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from 100 km-range-capacity electric flying cars are 66 g CO<inf>2</inf>/passenger-ground km eq., 11% and 62% higher than those from on-road internal combustion engine vehicles and battery electric vehicles. With battery specific energy increasing to 400 Wh/kg and 600 Wh/kg, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions can be reduced by 39% and 45%. Reduction in grid emission factor further contributes to emissions reduction, with emissions from electric flying cars lower than those from on-road internal combustion engine vehicles in multiple regional and temporal grid contexts.

For this aim, we first develop an empirical operating model considering operating characteristics of the distribution system with the BSS explicitly. Then, on this basis, a rolling optimization scheduling model of the distribution network is established. In particular, a refined BSS model including a new calculation method of available generation capacity (AGC) is included. Finally, a quantitative method to quantify the effect of BSS on reliability and economy of distribution networks is proposed. Compared with existing works, the main contribution of this paper is threefold. (i) A battery-level BSS operational model including AGC calculation is proposed to fully explore the V2G potential of the BSS. (ii) A rolling optimization scheduling model is established, which fully exploits the potential interaction between economy and reliability of system operation. (iii) An assessment framework is proposed to analyze the special value of BSS resources from aspects of both economy improvement and reliability enhancement, which can provide more practical instruction for BSS planning. Numerical studies are conducted based on IEEE 33-bus distribution network to verify the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. The simulation results show that if V2G of the BSS is orderly exploited and managed, the net profit of the distribution system will increase by 11.97%, and system expected energy not supplied (SEENS) will decrease by 14.34%.

Accordingly, an hourly optimal energy management (HOEM) system is applied to minimize the multi-objective objective function for each level. The lower level may be operated in islanded or grid-connected mode in some hours. This is decided by changing switches between MGs, clusters, and grids, while the upper level is only operated in the grid-connected mode. Moreover, a demand response program that has a great effect on the hourly planning of switches is modeled in the upper level. The proposed model is tested on CMGs and actual distribution systems.

maybe,,Two-layer robust optimization framework for resilience enhancement of microgrids considering hydrogen and electrical energy storage systems,"This paper presents a two-layer framework for improving the resilience of a 118-bus active distribution network consisting of four microgrids, which includes hybrid storage systems, electric buses (EBs), and the direct load control (DLC) program. In the proposed model, the uncertainties of RESs generation, demand, and EBs’ mobility are considered, and the robust optimization approach is used to tackle them. In the first layer, the planning of each microgrid is done separately and the energy purchase/sale request is sent to the control center. Then in the second layer, the control center performs the planning of the main network according to the requested program of the microgrids. Note that in this layer, the control center is able to rearrange the distribution feeder and send EBs to vital points of the network. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is evaluated through the implementation on seven case studies and the results show that the presence of hydrogen and electrical storage devices reduces forced load shedding (FLS) by 45.03% and 12.19%, respectively, during emergency situations. In addition, the results indicate that robust planning and the use of EBs for network recovery increase the resilience index by 3.35% and 3.98%, respectively. © 2022",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.255,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.255,15,high
maybe,,Optimization of an energy district for fuel cell electric vehicles: Cost scenarios of a real case study on a waste and recycling fleet,"This paper analyses the planning and operation of an energy district that aims to integrate a hydrogen supply chain for feeding vehicles based on fuel cell technology. A model of an energy district and an optimization algorithm based on the economic parameters are presented and validated leveraging an existing energy district, simulating several scenarios depending on different economic conditions and technical parameters. The model of the energy district evaluates energy balances, distinguishing hydrogen and electrical energy flows; the districts can include an FCEV fleet, electrical loads, energy generators, storage system and an electrolyser for producing hydrogen from the green energy surplus produced in the district as well as drawing energy from the power distribution network. The algorithm, based on MILP, is used for optimizing the flows in the district; indeed, it evaluates all the technical and economic constraints at a certain timestamp and provides optimal scheduling of the energy units. Model and algorithm have been used to evaluate different scenarios that were identified by varying the economic parameters (i.e., prices of electrical energy and hydrogen) as well as district design (i.e., upgrading sizes of the generators and electrolysers). Energy district parameters have been identified exploiting real data collected in an existing district located in Terni (Italy) owned by the local multi-utility ASM Terni S.p.A. It already includes a fleet for waste management, PV plants, office buildings and warehouses. Through parameters combination, 1125 OPEX and 729 CAPEX simulated scenarios have been evaluated and reported; each scenario assesses the daily variation of variables' economic trends covering the timeframe from 2030 to 2050. Results of simulations highlight the most convenient economic contexts as well as the envisioned amount of expenditures for adopting FCEV in the presented district or similar ones. For the case study, the forecasted cost of the hydrogen district, including FCEVs, is fully comparable to current costs, resulting in some cases even cheaper. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.08.114,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.08.114,15,high

The promotion of V2G mode needs to consider the effectiveness of policy costs, so it is urgent to estimate the potential benefits of V2G. In this paper, a multi-regional power dispatch and expansion model is constructed from the perspective of power system by taking China's plan to reach 1.2 billion kW of installed wind and photovoltaic power generation capacity in 2030 as an example, combining with the development planning of electric vehicles and power systems. The results show that by 2030, the implementation of unidirectional V2G and bidirectional V2G in China can reduce the total cost of power system by 2.02% and 2.08%, reduce the annual carbon emissions of the power system by 2.27% and 2.95%, and increase the total proportion of wind and photovoltaic power generation by 1.33% and 1.28% in the power mix. An increasing proportion of electric vehicles participate in V2G increases the proportion of new-installed wind generation and decreases that of photovoltaic power. Due to the high cost of battery degradation and the current power mix dominated by coal-fired generation, additional benefits of implementing bidirectional V2G over unidirectional V2G are limited. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129833,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129833,15,high
maybe,,Decentralized cooperative approach for electric vehicle charging,"The proliferation in the deployment of electric vehicles has brought up several challenges in the planning and operation of power systems. The health of power system components and the satisfaction of electric vehicle users are becoming equally important with the increasing presence of electric vehicles on the power grid. The charging strategy is crucial as it plays a significant role in shaping users’ behavior to deal with the adverse effects of electric vehicles on grid components. There is a lack of a proper unified framework for the charging management, which considers both the system perspectives such as transformer overloading, shortage of power, and users perspectives such as satisfaction, charging urgency, and privacy. This paper presents a fully decentralized cooperative approach/strategy for charging electric vehicles. The solution is achieved by developing a decentralized iterative algorithm based on a consensus concept to protect the privacy of EV owners. The charging priority factor is incorporated to address the charging urgency of electric vehicles. Multiple electric vehicles can be charged simultaneously without a central decision-maker or coordinator using the proposed strategy. As a result, electric vehicles fulfill their charging needs by the deadline to maximize user satisfaction while respecting their constraints and limitations imposed by the available charging power and charging station capacity. The convergence of the proposed approach is demonstrated by observing the charging of multiple electric vehicles. The results are benchmarked against the centralized approach to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132590,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132590,15,high

This course will be an unprecedented event in the industry history, and it will inevitably influence and change the power grid and the transportation network. The projection of EV population is the basis to coordinate the development of EV and urban systems. This paper proposes a modified Bass diffusion model to fulfill this task. Firstly, advantages of Bass diffusion model are analyzed, while car scrappage and technology competition with internal combust engine vehicle (ICEV) are involved to improve the model. Secondly, performance of the proposed model is evaluated with actual data during 2006–2020, and the EV stock up to 2050 is projected with the assessment of uncertainties. Thirdly, the policy on license plate quota and the ban on ICEV sales are discussed through experiment simulation. In a standard growing mode, EV is expected to dominant the new sales market by 2030 in Shanghai, and to completely replace ICEV before 2050.

maybe,,A framework for the assessment of electric bus charging station construction: A case study for Stockholm's inner city,"Electromobility has gained momentum in the last years following the efforts to reduce transportation-related emissions. In this context, efficient charging infrastructure is vital to foster the expansion of electric vehicles. This paper presents a standardized framework for micro-scale analysis of potential charging locations for electric buses aiming at easing the analysis process and promoting the expansion of electric buses. The framework is tailor-made for the Municipality of Stockholm and tested in two city-centre public transport hubs, namely Odenplan and Slussen. However, the framework can be used in other locations by implementing minimum changes. Connecting charging stations to the power grid is identified as the main drawback in city-centre locations due to their high impact on the grid. Lack of available capacity at nearby connection points results in long distance connections, reaching up to 1 km in some cases. Such connections impact the overall cost of electrification directly, as they may account for up to 63% of the total cost. Although other issues regarding space availability and operational efficiency also need to be addressed, such as the lack of enough dwell time to charge the batteries, the framework proves the suitability of these inner-city locations as charging points. © 2021",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103610,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2021.103610,15,high

One of the most effective alternatives to mitigate pollution is to promote green mobility via electric vehicles. However, the lack of electric charging stations may decrease individuals’ satisfaction to use electric vehicles in daily life. To bridge the gaps, this paper aims to simultaneously allocate electric vehicle charging stations and smart photovoltaic inverters in distribution networks to optimize three important objective functions, including power loss, voltage deviation, and voltage unbalance factor. To solve such a multi-objective optimization problem, a novel hybrid fuzzy Pareto dominance concept with differential evolution algorithm is proposed. A scenario-based framework is also used to capture the uncertainties of the model comprising loads, PVs’ generation and the demand of electric vehicle charging stations. The effectiveness of the stochastic multi-objective approach is then examined and verified on an unbalanced 37-bus network under different case studies. Attained results illustrate that if smart photovoltaic inverters integrate into the network with charging stations, the network performance is significantly improved, such as keeping voltage unbalance factor under standard value accounting for two percent. © 2022",10.1016/j.scs.2022.104029,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2022.104029,15,high
maybe,,Intelligent charging planning for electric vehicle commercial parking lots and its impact on distribution network's imbalance indices,"The outstanding demand of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has resulted the expansion of parking lots, while leading issues such as imbalance in power grid. Therefore, the critically planned charging stations infrastructure is essential to resolve these problems. In fact, the distribution network operators (DSO), EV users, and intelligent commercial parking lots (CPL) owners are holding different views that should be considered simultaneously to improve the accuracy of an effective business plan. However, the prime challenge in addressing the planning of CPL is to increase the EV user interest while enhancing the CPL owners’ profit. Simultaneously, DSO requirement for network performance under the appropriate conditions (for example, imbalance) will also be considered. Further one of the main challenges of CPL presence in an imbalanced distribution network is the effect that additionally carry on network imbalance indices. In this paper, a two-stage framework has proposed where the first stage is accompanied with several technical parameters such as battery terms, charge/discharge specifications, and transportation parameters including daily distance traveled, arrival and departure times to the CPL, and amount EV sales, the profitability of the EV charging/discharging program for EV users as well as CPL owners calculated in the optimal CPL scheduling. In the second stage, the effect of CPLs is studied by calculating the imbalance indices in a standard IEEE imbalanced distribution network. Moreover, the results confirm that the average profit for EV users has been increased by 23% compared to the total cost paid for charging EV. Eventually, it is recognized that without changing the distribution network structure and connecting CPL to active commercial loads of the distribution network, the network imbalance could be improved around 30% during EV charging. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100620,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2022.100620,15,high

The model includes (i) economic variables related to the capital cost of the DERs capacity installed with their respective operational costs and (ii) operational technical constraints based on the AC power flow equations. The formulation estimates the distributed generation (DG) capacity in terms of apparent power, i.e., the capacity found by the model relates the active and reactive power injected from DG to the DN simultaneously. A linearization and a modified version of the genetic algorithm (GA) solve the mix-integer non-linear problem (MINLP), and the backward algorithm is applied to reduce the number of scenarios. The model is tested in the IEEE 69-bus system under 18 different scenarios of 24 h to measure the DERs capacity installed variability. Finally, the results showed that (i) the set of scenarios selected are decisive for the optimal capacity installed affecting the investment and the Grid dependence, (ii) the PEVs affect the total DERs capacity installed and the operation costs, and (iii) the reactive power provided by the DERs might supply the total reactive power demand. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100624,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2022.100624,15,high
maybe,,Multi-stage planning of fast charging stations for PEVs using traffic-based approach,"The rising environmental concerns and easily accessible power system infrastructure have elevated the use of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in transportation systems. However, PEVs growth is moderate owing to range anxiety of drivers. In this context, fast charging stations (FCSs) deployment is an emerging development to lower the range anxiety of drivers. Though, heavy deployment of PEVs has up-surged the need of load demand on power systems. This requires a coordinated operation between power systems and future transportation systems to meet their demands. The FCS investors have keen interest in the net present value (NPV) of the project. On the other hand, the utility wants to keep its peak demand within the limits to ensure the safe-operation. This creates a contradiction between the FCS investor and utility’ objectives. Thus, this paper proposes an analytical approach for traffic-based multi-stage planning of FCS that aids FCS investor by considering PEV traffic, staggered investments, convenience of PEV drivers, profit on investments, and capacity limit of FCS imposed by the utility. The formulation for NPV is modified to account the revenue incurred owing to staggered investments. Proposed methodology determines a set of few sub-solutions constrained by mean service time of PEVs. This facilitates FCS investor to select the planning solution on the basis of his/her satisfaction. Detailed investigation of the proposed methodology highlights the applications and importance on assessing the FCS investors’ concerns while considering the affecting factors of transportation system, power system, drivers’ concerns, and profit margins altogether. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100662,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2022.100662,15,high
maybe,,Effect of uncertainties on siting and sizing of charging stations and renewable energy resources: A modified capacitated flow-refueling location model,"Fast-charging stations (FCSs) are critical charging infrastructures for electric vehicles (EVs) that can impose a significant load demand on the distribution network. Therefore, one of the original challenges in the development of EVs is the optimal allocation of FCSs considering the goals and limitations of both transportation and distribution networks. This paper proposes a model for locating FCSs and renewable energy resources (RESs) taking into account the EVs behavior as well as a wide range of affecting factors, including the uncertainty associated with the RESs, EVs arrival rate, and state of charge (SoC), different driving ranges, and all-shortest and deviation paths. The proposed model minimizes the costs of installing FCSs and RESs and substation expansion and maximizes the traffic flow captured by the FCSs. For this purpose, first, the modeling of the uncertainties of RESs and the capacitated diversion flow-refueling location model based on expanded networks (CDFRLM-EN) is introduced to cover the charging demand of EVs on the transportation network. Then the problem of locating FCSs and RESs is formulated based on the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The proposed framework is implemented on a 14-bus distribution test system coupled with a 25-node transportation network. The results show that the presence of RESs, diversion paths, and the uncertainty associated with the arrival state of charge and the driving range differences influence the location and size of FCSs, the investment cost, and the EVs’ satisfaction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100759,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2022.100759,15,high
maybe,,Cooperative control of EVs participating in demand response based on improved discrete-time leader-following consensus,"As an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) participate in the demand response (DR) planning and control in the distribution network, the grid power imbalance is aggravated, which affects the stabilization of voltage at charging side (VCS) of EV charging stations (EVCSs). Therefore, in this paper, the cost model of EV DR and incremental cost rate (ICR) model of load response are established at first for solving the problems. Then, the ICR update criteria of agents are designed. Based on the criteria, an improved discrete-time leader-following consensus (IDTLFC) algorithm based on ICR is proposed. Also, the cooperative control method of EVs participating in DR based on the algorithm was presented. By employing the proposed algorithm, the method can calculate the ICR and response load value of agents. Likewise, the quick reduction of total system power offset and the completion of response load indicator can be achieved by utilizing the EV response layer to execute the response instructions. In the simulation experiments, the simulation model of multi-agent system based on EVs is established. The two system working modes of ”peak shaving and valley filling” (PSVF), plug-and-play characteristic of agents and so on are simulated. The results have shown that, when EV are linked to the grid and generate the power fluctuation, the total power balance and the stabilization of VCS could be kept with the method. The PSVF, minimum response cost and reasonable power distribution are realized simultaneously.

maybe,,Optimal allocation of renewable energy source and charging station for PHEVs,"Renewable energy forms have a comparatively less impact on the environment when compared with non-renewable sources. Renewable energies like wind power, biomass, hydropower, solar power, and geothermal energies are preferred for production as they do not run out quickly. Owing to the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) load demand, large-scale penetration of these resources from the power system affects the network performance like reduce power quality, increase power loss, and voltage deviation. These issues can be addressed by the optimum planning depending upon the variables outcome in RES to satisfy the extra demand affected by PHEV charging. At the same time, designing a proper and effective energy management strategy in PHEV can be considered an optimization problem and can be resolved by the use of metaheuristic algorithms. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel deep learning with metaheuristic optimization based allocation of RES and charging stations for PHEVs. The proposed model depends upon model predictive control (MPC) where the actual battery state of charge (SOC) is concerned with real time energy management. Moreover, the black widow optimization (BWO) algorithm is used for the optimal allocation of RES and charging stations. The BWO algorithm derives objective functions using different parameters of the charging stations. In addition, based on the MPC model, deep stacked autoencoder (DSAE) is applied for the prediction of near-future velocity.

maybe,,A Q-learning based electric vehicle scheduling technique in a distribution system for power loss curtailment,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more common in the distribution network (DN), which burdens the system throughout the charging cycle. However, if EVs are used to assist the utility according to its demands, the scenario turns profitable. In this paper, a new methodology to schedule the EVs and distributed generation (DG) according to the DN system demand is proposed. The proposed method is a hybrid of the intelligent Q-learning algorithm, Loss Sensitivity factor (LSF), and Enhanced Grasshopper Optimization (EGOA) techniques. The main objective of this work is to encourage peak shaving, minimize the power loss and improve the voltage profile of overall DN in presence of EVs. The modelling of EVs is done by considering the most significant parameters such as EV State of Charge (EV SoC), travel itinerary, capacity of EV battery, and charging/discharging levels. Initially the location of EV charging stations and DGs are determined using LSF technique. Further peak shaving of DN considering EVs behaviour is implemented using Q-learning based smart charging method. Later the sizes of DGs are determined using EGOA technique. EGOA is an enhancement in the already existing grasshopper optimization technique that improves the algorithm's exploring capability. The hybrid approach helped in identifying the strong buses for EV charging station and DG placement. Further a peak shave of overall DN demand is achieved using Q-learning technique. Later using EGOA the DG sizing along with optimal EV placement helped in reduction of power loss by around 67% compared to base case.

maybe,,An integrated optimization platform for spatial-temporal modeling of electric vehicle charging infrastructure,"Vehicle electrification has been identified as one of the most important roles in decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in transportation. Proper placement of charging infrastructures and management of charging activities is the key to ensuring the environmental benefits from the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). By employing empirical travel trajectory data, this paper investigates how individual travel and dwelling patterns can affect the distribution of spatial and temporal opportunities for electric vehicle charging, as well as charging infrastructure installation across regions. We formulate an integrated optimization platform for estimating electric vehicle charging infrastructure placement in home and non-home locations simultaneously that include infrastructure costs and dynamic electricity prices with a mixed-integer linear programming. We provide two case studies in the Great Sacramento Area and San Diego, California. The results show that higher non-home charging opportunity informed by the empirical travel and dwelling patterns offers more potentials for a shared public charging system in San Diego, resulting in 14−30% lower in total system cost and 21−25% lower in emissions. This indicates that the heterogeneity in spatial and temporal travel and dwelling patterns substantially affect the design of the charging infrastructure system, and significantly change the energy, economic and environmental impacts of the system. We also observe sensible timing of charging in non-home locations that correspond to daytime hours and a secondary peak in charging at home locations during nighttime hours in both regions, emphasizing the importance of integrating grid dynamics into EV charging infrastructures planning process.

However, there is a huge gap between energy demand and supply due to the rise of different electric products and electric vehicles.

With increasing wind power penetration in the power system, the flexibility demand and the possibility of wind spillage are on the rise. Under the tight power balance state, the flexibility solely provided by thermal units will reduce the system flexibility, resulting in load shedding. It is imperative to utilize flexible resources to reduce wind spillage and load shedding. To address the above problems, the power system flexibility supply and demand model and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations operation model are first constructed in this paper. On this basis, a disposal strategy for tight power balance with EV charging stations providing flexible ramping capacity is established. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted on the modified IEEE 118-bus system.

This article aims at proposing a new framework to maximize the hosting capacity (HC) of DGs in a distribution network. This operation-planning framework provides a suitable and interactive environment for the electricity market, distribution company (DISCO), electric vehicle (EV) aggregator, and rival DISCOs to increase the HC. The problem is modeled via a bilevel conditional-value-at-risk-constrained stochastic programming approach. The DISCO, in the upper level (UL), tries to maximize the HC and minimize the operating costs while interacting with a passive electricity market and an EV aggregator. The aggregator, in the lower level, aims to maximize their profit by interacting with the primary DISCO in the UL and the rival DISCO, to satisfy the EV owners.

Existing research on EV routing planning and charging navigation strategies mainly focuses on vehicle-road-network interactions, but the vehicle-to-vehicle interaction has rarely been considered, particularly in studying simultaneous charging requests. To investigate the interaction of multiple vehicles in routing planning and charging, a routing optimization of EVs for charging with an event-driven pricing strategy is proposed. The urban area of a city is taken as a case for numerical simulation, which demonstrates that the proposed strategy can not only alleviate the long-time queuing for EV fast charging but also improve the utilization rate of charging infrastructures. Note to Practitioners—This article was inspired by the concerns of difficulties for electric vehicle (EV)’s fast charging and the imbalance of the utilization rate of charging facilities. Existing route optimization and charging navigation research are mainly applicable to static traffic networks, which cannot dynamically adjust driving routes and charging strategies with real-time traffic information. Besides, the mutual impact between vehicles is rarely considered in these works in routing planning. To resolve the shortcomings of existing models, a receding-horizon-based strategy that can be applied to dynamic traffic networks is proposed. In this article, various factors that the user is concerned about within the course of driving are converted into driving costs, through which each road section of traffic networks is assigned the corresponding values. Combined with the graph theory analysis method, the mathematical form of the dynamic traffic network is presented.

In turn, the resultant growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) calls for the development of a well-designed charging infrastructure. However, an inappropriate placement of charging stations might hamper smooth operation of the power grid and be inconvenient to EV drivers. Thus, the present work proposes a novel two-stage planning model for charging station placement. The candidate locations for the placement of charging stations are first determined by fuzzy inference considering distance, road traffic, and grid stability. The randomness in road traffic is modelled by applying a Bayesian network (BN). Then, the charging station placement problem is represented in a multi-objective framework with cost, voltage stability reliability power loss (VRP) index, accessibility index, and waiting time as objective functions. A hybrid algorithm combining chicken swarm optimization and the teaching-learning-based optimization (CSO TLBO) algorithm is used to obtain the Pareto front.

Traditionally, transportation and power systems are often studied separately, each by itself as a complex system. This paper proposes a system of systems modeling framework for planning charging infrastructure deployment in intercity transportation networks while considering users’ travel behavior and coupling relationships between transportation and power systems. The aim is at facilitating long-distance electric vehicle travels and providing an effective and comprehensive tool to evaluate the total emissions from both the transportation and power sectors. We look at a somewhat “forward-looking” problem in which the charging loads of widely-adopted electric vehicles induce interdependence between the power and the transportation sectors. A general equilibrium modeling framework is developed to capture the interdependencies among charging infrastructure design, users’ travel behaviors, and power sector operations.

This is referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key milestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation sectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully, then contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could in fact be counterproductive to it. This occurs due to two phenomena operating in tandem — the randomness of EV usage patterns and the possibility of strategic behavior by EV users.

Recharging of EVs should be carried out repeatedly over time, and the energy needed for this is high and increasing. With the present infrastructure, we cannot supply the required energy, and therefore, we need to implement a model that expands the power grid to satisfy our energy requirements. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network-based dynamic capacity expansion (CNN-DCE) for EV charging. Flower pollination optimization algorithm (FPOA) was used to improve the hyperparameters of CNN during training. The main aim is to reduce the cost of installing additional capacity resources and to reduce the operational cost. To cope with the load growth, different capacity resources are installed at different years of the planning boundary. Five statistical indices, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, correlation coefficient, and scatter index, are used to evaluate the performance of CNN. The capacity expansion plan in the microgrid is achieved by expanding the energy of battery energy storage systems, microturbines, and solar and wind energy systems. The queuing delay for the EVs waiting in a queue for recharging has been considered. The performance of the proposed CNN-DCE is studied and compared with three other state-of-the-art methods.

maybe,,Constrained Fuzzy Power Flow Applied to Transmission Congestion,"The deregulation of the electricity industry, the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, and the presence of new stakeholders, such as Electric Vehicles (EV), make managing transmission system congestion critical. In this context, load flow methodologies that consider non-probabilistic uncertainty due to a lack of data (particularly concerning EV) seem to be a handy tool to analyze network congestion situations and to support electrical network planning. The congestion of the branches is related to the load and generation of the network buses. Still, the congestion of a specific branch may not be related to the load and generation on the neighbouring buses. In this line, Fuzzy Power Flow (FPF) is suitable for identifying congestion situations in the transmission system and the branches responsible for such cases when probabilistic models may not describe uncertainty. This paper uses an FPF model, a non-linearized Constrained Fuzzy Power Flow (CFPF), to characterize congestion situations in transmission network planning. The application of the CFPF to analyze congestion situations is a novelty.

Soft open points (SOPs) have been used to create a multi-objective framework that considers loss minimization and voltage profile enhancement. The non-linear multi-variable complicated SOP allocation problem is solved for the first time using a modern meta-heuristic Aquila optimizer (AO). The modified IEEE 33-bus benchmark and IEEE 69-bus ADNs are used in the simulations. Before SOPs, the average real power loss in IEEE 33-bus AND was 370.329 kW, but after SOPs, it was reduced to 259.356 kW (i.e., 29.96 percent reduction). Similarly, effective SOPs integration in the IEEE 69-bus resulted in a loss reduction of 81.07 percent. AO's computational efficiency is also compared to that of multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and cuckoo search algorithm (CSA).

maybe,,Optimal Siting of Capacitors in Distribution Grids Considering Electric Vehicle Load Growth Using Improved Flower Pollination Algorithm,"The optimal VAr compensation using capacitor banks (CBs) in radial distribution networks (RDNs) is solved in this paper while taking the growth of the load from electric vehicles (EVs) into consideration. This is accomplished by adapting an improved variant of the flower pollination algorithm (IFPA) with an enhanced local search capability. The primary objective of determining the locations and sizes of CBs is to minimize the distribution losses in the operation and control of RDNs. Additionally, the effect of CBs is shown by the increased net savings, greater voltage stability, and improved voltage profile. A voltage stability index (VSI) was used in the optimization process to determine the predefined search space for CB locations, and a double-direction learning strategy (DLS) was then considered to optimize the locations and sizes while maintaining a balance between the exploration and exploitation phases. Three IEEE RDNs were used to simulate various EV load increase scenarios as well as typical loading situations. According to a comparison with the literature, the IPFA produced global optimum results, and the proposed CBs allocation approach demonstrated enhanced performance in RDNs under all scenarios of EV load growth. © 2022, University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Science.

The ELF is most prominent for the distinct applications of MPS and VPP such as real-Time analysis of energy storage system, distributed energy resources, demand side management and electric vehicles etc. To manage the real-Time challenges and map the stable power demand, in different time steps, the ELF is evaluated in yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly, etc. basis.

maybe,,Optimal Operation of Electric Vehicles and Distributed Generation Resources in Smart Grid Considering Load Management,"Technology advancement and the global tendency to use renewable energy in distributed generation units in the distribution network have been proposed as sources of energy supply. Despite the complexity of their protection, as well as the operation of distributed generation resources in the distribution network, factors such as improving reliability, increasing production capacity of the distribution network, stabilizing the voltage of the distribution network, reducing peak clipping losses, as well as economic and environmental considerations, have expanded the influence of distributed generation (DG) resources in the distribution network. The location of DG sources and their capacity are the key factors in the effectiveness of distributed generation in the voltage stability of distribution systems. Nowadays, along with the scattered production sources of electric vehicles with the ability to connect to the network, due to having an energy storage system, they are known as valuable resources that can provide various services to the power system. These vehicles can empower the grid or be used as a storage supply source when parked and connected to the grid. This paper introduces and studies a two-stage planning framework for the concurrent management of many electric vehicles and distributed generation resources with private ownership. In the first stage, the aim is to increase the profit of electric vehicles and distributed generation sources; finally, the purpose is to reduce operating costs. The proposed scheduling framework is tested on a distribution network connected to bus 5 of the RBTS sample network. Besides distributed generation sources and electric vehicles, we integrate timeconsistent load management into the system. Due to distributed generation sources such as photovoltaic systems and wind turbines and the studied design in the modeling, we use the Taguchi TOAT algorithm to generate and reduce the scenario to ensure the uncertainty in renewable energy.

First, a probability distribution model of scenery output and EV timing is constructed, and the starting charge state of multiple types of EVs is replaced by the number of daily driving miles subjectively set; then, based on the complex network theory, timing safety indicators, such as voltage overrun risk and branch power overload operation risk, are proposed, and the economic risk is established according to the economic operation of the distribution grid; Furthermore, a risk assessment matrix for grid-connected EVs with different capacities is constructed, and the principal component analysis (PCA) method is used to reduce the dimension of the risk assessment matrix and calculate the objective weight coefficient; finally, taking the improved IEEE 33 node AC/DC power distribution system as an example, the comprehensive risk evaluation based on PCA is compared with the traditional one, and the results show that when the safety and economic risk factors are considered at the same time, the operation risk in a certain range has a downward trend when the proposed method is adopted, which has a positive guiding significance for the planning of EV capacity in a certain area. © © 2022 Dong, Zhao, Liu, Li, Yu, Liu and Wang.",10.3389/fenrg.2022.816246,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3389/fenrg.2022.816246,15,high

This research presents a hierarchical optimization strategy, for improving the safe and economical operation of DN considering the DGs and EVs integration. In Stage 1, the MPPT control model of DGs is designed to obtain the best energy conversion efficiency. In Stage 2, load models of EVs and battery energy storage system (BESS) under coordinate charging/discharging stimulated by a time-of-use incentive mechanism are established respectively, to achieve a load curve with a minimized peak-to-valley difference (PVD). In Stage 3, aiming for the best compromise between the active power loss and node voltage excursion, daily optimal scheduling of the static Var compensator (SVC) capacitors is dynamically worked out according to the varying power demand, as the solution for the defined multi-objective optimization problem. For enhancing the convergence speed, an advanced genetic algorithm with elite preservation strategy is employed. The proposed hierarchical strategy is demonstrated on an IEEE 33-node DN test case, and the simulation results show that first, the MPPT control ensures the maximum power outputs of DGs; next, power supply pressure could be relieved by the load shifting effects of the coordinated vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service and BESS configuration, reflected in the decreased load peak from 4,370.1 to 3,424.99 kW, and the optimized PVD from 1763.8 to 703.8 kW; meanwhile, via applicable power planning of the SVC components, optimized power loss and voltage quality can both be achieved, proving the feasibility of the optimization strategy, which promotes the economic and reliable operation of the DN system. © © 2022 Huang, Ma, Wang, Fang and Zhang.",10.3389/fenrg.2022.869844,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3389/fenrg.2022.869844,15,high
maybe,,Optimization of multiple battery swapping stations with mobile support for ancillary services,"The recent developments in electric vehicles (EVs) causes several issues that have not been satisfactorily addressed. One of the foremost problems is the charging–discharging processes of EV batteries with diverse characteristics. Although a charging station is the first choice in this regard, a battery swap station (BSS) is also a suitable alternative solution as it eliminates long waiting periods and battery degradation due to fast charging. BSS has the capability to ensure prompt and efficient service for electric vehicles. Since BSS has a large number of battery systems, optimum planning of the charging–discharging operations of the batteries is critical for both BSS and the grid. This study presents an optimal charging–discharging schedule for multiple BSSs based on the swap demand of privately owned EVs and electric bus (EB) public transportation system. In addition, BSSs reinforce the power grid by providing ancillary services such as peak shaving and valley filling with demand response programs. In order to increase the flexibility of the operation, the mobile swapping station (MSS) concept, an innovative and dynamic service, is introduced to the literature and added to the model. The results indicate that BSS is an essential agent in the ancillary services market and the MSS concept is a yielding solution for both BSSs and power networks.

maybe,,Power System Impacts of Electric Vehicle Charging Strategies,"This article explores the potential impacts of integrating electric vehicles (EVs) and variable renewable energy (VRE) on power system operation. EVs and VRE are integrated in a production cost model with a 5 min time resolution and multiple planning horizons to deduce the effects of variable generation and EV charging on system operating costs, EV charging costs, dispatch stacks, reserves and VRE curtailment. EV penetration scenarios of the light-duty vehicle fleet of 10%, 20%, and 30% are considered in the RTS-GMLC test system, and VRE penetration is 34% of annual energy consumption. The impacts of EVs are investigated during the annual peak in the summer and during the four weeks of the year in which high VRE and low loads lead to overgeneration. Uncoordinated and coordinated EV charging scenarios are considered. In the uncoordinated scenario, charging is undertaken at the convenience of the EV owners, modeled using data from the Idaho National Laboratory’s EV Project. Coordinated charging uses an “aggregator” model, wherein EV charging is scheduled to minimize operating costs while meeting the daily charging requirements subject to EV availability and charging constraints. The results show that at each EV penetration level, the uncoordinated charging costs were higher than the coordinated charging costs. During a high-VRE, low-load week, with uncoordinated EV charging at 30% penetration (3% energy penetration), the peak load increased by as much as 27%. Using coordinated charging, the EV load shifts to hours with low prices, coincident with either low load, high VRE, or both. Furthermore, coordinated charging substantially reduces the curtailment of PV by as much as nine times during the low-load seasons, and the curtailment of wind generation by more than half during the summer peak season, compared to the scenarios with no EVs and uncoordinated EV charging. Using a production cost model with multiple planning cycles, load and VRE forecasts, and a “look ahead” period during scheduling and dispatching units was crucial in creating and utilizing the flexibility of coordinated EV charging. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/electricity3030017,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/electricity3030017,15,high

Meanwhile, decentralized and complex grid edge faces many challenges for planning, operation, and management of power systems. Therefore, providing a reliable communications infrastructure is vital. The fourth industrial revolution, that is, a cyber-physical system in conjunction with the Internet of Things (IoT) and coexistence of edge (fog) and cloud computing brings new ways of dealing with such challenges and helps maximize the benefits of power grids. From this perspective, as a use case of IoV, we present a cloud-based EV charging framework to tackle issues of high demand in charging stations during peak hours. A price incentive scheme and another scheme, electricity supply expansion, are presented and compared with the baseline. The results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical models improve the system performance and the quality of service (QoS) for EV customers. The proposed methods can efficiently assist system operators in managing the system design and grid stability. Further, to shed light on emerging technologies for smart and connected EVs, we elaborate on seven major trends: decentralized energy trading based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology, behavioral science and behavioral economics, artificial and computational intelligence and its applications, digital twins of IoV, software-defined IoVs, and intelligent EV charging with information-centric networking, and parking lot microgrids and EV-based virtual storage. We have also discussed some of the potential research issues in IoV to further study IoV.

However, in developing countries where the public transportation sector is growing quickly, energy‐environmental planning is urgently needed. This paper evaluates the future electricity demand, as well as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions reduction, due to the operation of an expected increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) in Paki-stan. The planning of EVs up to 2040 is performed with the ePop simulator that calculates the future EVs’ electricity demand, while EnergyPLAN® assesses the expected new power capacities. Two scenarios are investigated by penetrating 30% and 90% of 2/3 electric wheelers and cars by 2030 and 2040 compared to 2020, respectively. To fulfill the expected energy demand, PV in the daytime and the national electric grid at nighttime are here considered. Finally, a 9 GW of PV capacity is needed to satisfy the EVs’ electricity demand of 14.7 TWh/year, and a 0.7 GW power plants capacity is needed to fulfill 4.7 TWh/year by 2040. Consequently, EVs’ charging scenarios at daytime and nighttime are assessed.

The energy efficiency monitoring system is considered an information support tool for the management process. An object-oriented formalization of monitoring information technology is proposed which has a block structure and contains three categories of classes (information acquisition, calculation algorithms, and control procedures). An example of the implementation of the class “Operation with the electrical grid” of information technology is presented. The planning of the freight EVs charging under power limits of the charging station (CS) was carried out using a situational algorithm based on a Fuzzy expert system. The situational algorithm provides for monitoring the charging of a freight EV at a charging station, taking into account the charge weight index (CWI) assigned to it. The optimization of the CS electrical load is carried out from the standpoint of minimizing electricity costs and ensuring the demand for EV charging without going beyond its limits. A computer simulation of the EV charging mode and the CS load was performed. The results of modeling the electrical grid and CS load using the proposed algorithm were compared with the results of modeling using a controlled charging algorithm with electrical grid limitations and an uncontrolled charging algorithm. The proposed approach provides a reduction in power consumption during peak hours of the electrical grid and charging of connected EVs for an on-demand state of charge (SOC). © 2022 by the authors.

maybe,,A Two-Stage EV Charging Planning and Network Reconfiguration Methodology towards Power Loss Minimization in Low and Medium Voltage Distribution Networks,"The topic of power loss reduction in distribution systems has gained significant attention over recent years. Despite the efforts of the European Union towards the minimization of power losses, the decarbonization of the transport sector has raised several concerns, since charging overlaps of Electric Vehicles (EVs) can cause extensive power losses and power quality issues. Considering these, the present paper proposes a two-stage EV charging planning and Network Reconfiguration (NR) methodology, addressing the problem of power loss minimization in both Low-Voltage (LV) and Medium-Voltage (MV) Distribution Networks (DNs), respectively. In the first stage, considering the key role of the aggregator, the EV charging planning is applied to LV DN. In the second stage, the NR technique is applied to the MV DN, by taking into account the hourly power demand of LV DNs as obtained by the aggregators. The proposed methodology has been applied on a benchmarked MV network for which each node is represented by a real LV network. The results indicate that the proposed methodology could yield up to a 63.64% power loss reduction, in respect to the base scenario, i.e., no charging planning and no NR are applied. © 2022 by the authors.

First, considering the state of charge of the EV, the participation of the owner and other factors, the charging and discharging model is built. Then, the probabilistic power flow calculation based on Latin hypercube sampling is used to obtain the probability distribution of the voltage amplitude of the charge and discharge load connected to the distribution network, and finally the evaluation index is established to quantify and calculate the voltage quality of the distribution network participating in the V2G process of electric vehicles. Simulation results show that the evaluation method has the advantage of fast calculation speed while ensuring known accuracy, introduces the probability distribution of expected value and variance quantification of voltage amplitude, more intuitively understands the degree of influence on voltage quality before and after V2G, and can effectively assess the impact of electric vehicles accessing the distribution network in V2G mode on the power quality of low-voltage residential areas and industrial and commercial areas, and this evaluation method can provide useful reference for the formulation of future V2G control strategies and the planning of future urban power grids. © 2022 by the authors.

Nowadays, the evolution of distribution networks and investment decisions (conductors and transformers) can no longer be based solely on deterministic assumptions of load evolution since there is a high level of uncertainties related to the development of electrical loads such as electric vehicles. In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty of the peak power, key elements for triggering an investment, and the flexibility to choose between different topologies of electric networks. To solve this problem, we apply a real option approach and provide an analytical model with closed-form solutions that allows a full treatment of the dynamic aspects of the decision to reconsider the topology of the network. Moreover, through a comparative statics analysis, we infer the sensitivity of the option value to modify the network with respect to the volatility of the peak power, the associated investment cost or other types of costs of power losses, the growth rate, or the discount rate. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/en15166084,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en15166084,15,high
maybe,,Upgrading Conventional Power System for Accommodating Electric Vehicle through Demand Side Management and V2G Concepts,"The continually increasing fossil fuel prices, the dwindling of these fuels, and the bad environmental effects which mainly contribute to global warming phenomena are the main motives to replace conventional transportation means to electric. Charging electric vehicles (EVs) from renewable energy systems (RES) substantially avoids the side effects of using fossil fuels. The higher the increase in the number of EVs the greater the challenge to the reliability of the conventional power system. Increasing charging connections for EVs to the power system may cause serious problems to the power system, such as voltage fluctuations, contingencies in transmission lines, and loss increases. This paper introduces a novel strategy to not only replace the drawbacks of the EV charging stations on the power system’s stability and reliability, but also to enhance the power system’s performance. This improvement can be achieved using a smart demand side management (DSM) strategy and vehicle to grid (V2G) concepts. The use of DSM increases the correlation between the loads and the available generation from the RES. Besides this, the use of DSM, and the use of V2G concepts, also helps in adding a backup for the power system by consuming surplus power during the high generation period and supplying stored energy to the power system during shortage in generation. The IEEE 30 bus system was used as an example of an existing power system where each load busbar was connected to a smart EV charging station (SEVCS). The performance of the system with and without the novel DSM and V2G concepts was compared to validate the superiority of the concepts in improving the performance of the power system. The use of modified particle swarm optimization in optimal sizing and optimal load flow reduced the cost of energy and the losses of the power system. The use of the smart DSM and V2G concepts substantially improved the voltage profile, the transmission line losses, the fuel cost of conventional power systems, and the stability of the power system. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/en15186541,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en15186541,15,high
maybe,,Remuneration Sensitivity Analysis in Prosumer and Aggregator Strategies by Controlling Electric Vehicle Chargers,"The efficient use of energy resources is profoundly changing power grid regulation and policy. New forms of power generation coupled with storage and the presence of new, increasingly flexible loads such as electric vehicles enable the development of multi-agent planning systems based on new forms of interaction. For instance, consumers can take advantage of flexibility by interacting directly with the grid or through aggregators that bridge the gap between these end-users and traditional centralised markets. This paper aims to provide insight into the benefits for aggregators and end-users from a financial perspective by proposing a methodology that can be applied to different scenarios. End-users may provide flexibility services related to private vehicle charging stations or battery storage systems. The paper will analyse different remuneration levels for end-users by highlighting the most beneficial scenarios for aggregators and end-users and providing evidence on potential conflict of interests. The numerical results show that some consumers may benefit more from aggregation. This is because if taken individually, consumption habits do not allow the same flexibility when considering clusters of consumers with different behaviour. It is also shown that there are cases in which consumers do not seem to benefit from the presence of intermediate parties.

maybe,,"Fuzzy-Based Simultaneous Optimal Placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations, Distributed Generators, and DSTATCOM in a Distribution System","Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their inexpensive maintenance, performance improvements, and zero carbon footprint. The electric vehicle’s load impacts the distribution system’s performance as the electric vehicle’s adoption rises. As a result, the distribution system’s dependability depends on the precise location of the electric vehicle charging station (EVCS). The main challenge is the deteriorating impact of the distribution system caused by the incorrect placement of the charging station. The distribution system is integrated with the charging station in conjunction with the distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) and distributed generation (DG) to reduce the impact of the EVCS. This paper presents a fuzzy classified method for optimal sizings and placements of EVCSs, DGs, and DSTATCOMs for 69-bus radial distribution systems using the RAO-3 algorithm. The characteristic curves of Li-ion batteries were utilized for the load flow analysis to develop models for EV battery charging loads. The prime objective of the proposed method is to (1) Reduce real power loss; (2) Enhance the substation (SS) power factor (pf); (3) Enhance the distribution network’s voltage profile; and (4) Allocate the optimum number of vehicles at the charging stations. The proposed fuzzified RAO-3 algorithm improves the substation pf in the distribution system. The fuzzy multi-objective function is utilized for the two stages and simultaneous placements of the EVCS, DG, and DSTATCOM. The simulation results reveal that the simultaneous placement method performs better, due to the significant reduction in real power loss, improved voltage profile, and the optimum number of EVs.

A multi-objective function was formulated to minimize investment, peak loss, and annual energy loss costs at different load factors. The results obtained with the flower pollination algorithm were compared with the particle swarm optimization algorithm. In the second stage, a simple heuristic procedure was developed for the sizing and allocation of EV charging load at every node of the distribution system utilizing part of the annual energy savings obtained by optimal network reconductoring. The number of electric cars, electric bikes, and electric scooters that can be charged at every node was computed while maintaining the voltage and branch current constraints.

This paper proposes a method for obtaining the optimal sizing of DG units and EVCSs (considering uncertainty), to achieve exact power system analysis and ensure EV driver satisfaction. To model uncertainties in optimal sizing planning, this study first generates scenarios for each system asset using a probability distribution that considers the asset characteristics. In this step, the wind-turbine (WT), PV, and EVCS are modeled applying the Weibull, exponential, and kernel density estimation (KDE), and scenarios for each asset are gen-erated using random sampling. Then, the k-means clustering is carried out for scenario reduction and the representative scenario abstract. The probability of occurrence for each representative scenario is assigned depending on the number of observations within each cluster. The representative scenarios for each asset are integrated into the scenario for all assets through the joint probability. The integrated scenarios are applied in the optimization problem for optimal sizing of the system asset framework. The optimal sizing of the system assets problem is proposed (to minimize the line loss and voltage deviation) and formulated via stochastic second-order conic programming, to re-flect the uncertainty under an AC power flow; this is a convex problem that can be solved in poly-nomial time. The proposed method is tested on a modified IEEE 15 bus system, and the simulation is performed with various objective functions. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 by the authors.

maybe,,Sizing of a Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle with the Hybrid Energy Storage System,"For plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), using a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) instead of a single battery system can prolong the battery life and reduce the vehicle cost. To develop a PHEV with HESS, it is a key link to obtain the optimal size of the power supply and energy system that can meet the load requirements of a driving cycle. Since little effort has been dedicated to simultaneously performing the component sizing of PHEV and HESS, this paper proposes an approach based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to simultaneously determine the sizes of the engine, motor, battery and supercapacitor (SC) in a PHEV with HESS. The drivetrain cost is minimized in a different all-electric range (AER)—and depends on the battery type—while ensuring the driving performance requirements. In addition, the effects of the power system and drive cycle on the component sizes were analyzed and compared. The simulation results show that the cost of the PHEV drivetrain with the Ni-MH battery/SC HESS is reduced by up to 12.21% when compared to the drivetrain with the Li-ion battery/SC HESS. The drivetrain cost is reduced by 8.79% when compared to analysis-based optimization. The type of power supply system and drive cycle can significantly affect the optimization results. © 2022 by the authors.

maybe,,Modelling Electric Vehicle Charge Demand: Implementation for the Greek Power System,"The emerging popularity of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) is creating new connections between the transportation and electric sectors, and PEV charging will bring new opportunities and challenges to a system of growing complexity. The electrification of transport will increase energy security, reduce carbon emissions, and improve local air quality. The actual expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) will depend on several factors: the evolution of autonomy, the acquisition price, the charging process and infrastructure, etc. This paper provides a guide for simulating the accumulative load profile for EV charging on a national level. The importance of all the parameters and variables involved (deterministic or stochastic) is investigated. Detailed tables and references concerning the distribution of values and the composition of the EV fleet are provided. A multivariate probabilistic model is developed considering the EV classes, weekly and seasonal driving patterns, charging strategies, battery capacities, consumption per EV, etc., leading to an accurate estimation of aggregated EV charging demand. Finally, a net-metering scheme is proposed, in which a photovoltaic (PV) system of a certain size will be able to provide the annual energy needs of the first 10,000 EVs in the Greek market.",10.3390/wevj13070115,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/wevj13070115,15,high
maybe,,Optimization Model of Electric Vehicles Charging and Discharging Strategy Considering the Safe Operation of Distribution Network,"Against the background of carbon neutrality, the power dispatching operation mode has undergone great changes. It not only gradually realizes the coordinated control of source–grid– load–storage, but also strives to realize the multi-level coordination of the transmission network, distribution network and microgrid. Disorderly charging and discharging of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) will have a great negative impact on the distribution network, but aggregating EVs and guiding them to charge and discharge in an orderly manner will play a positive role in delaying investment in the distribution network. Therefore, it is urgent to adopt an effective scheduling control strategy for electric vehicle charging and discharging. First, a variety of indexes were set to analyze the influence of EVs access on distribution network and the correlation between the indexes. Then, by defining the EVs penetration rate and the load simultaneous rate, the charging load planning of EVs was calculated. Based on the simultaneous load rate, the regional electricity load plan was calculated, and a configuration model of distribution capacity suitable for charging loads in different regions was constructed. Finally, an optimal dispatch model for electric vehicles considering the safety of distribution network was proposed and the distribution transformer capacity allocation model was used as the optimization target constraint. Compared with most optimized dispatch models used to maximize aggregator revenues and reduce peak-to-valley differences and load fluctuations in distribution networks, this model could effectively reduce unnecessary investment while meeting regional distribution transformer needs and maintaining distribution network security. Taking the improved IEEE 34-bus systems as an example, the simulation analysis was carried out and the investment demand of distribution network under the condition of disordered and orderly charge and discharge was compared. The results show that the proposed optimal scheduling method can effectively reduce the load fluctuation of distribution network, keep the voltage offset within the allowable voltage deviation range, and can effectively delay the investment of distribution network. © 2022 by the authors.

maybe,,"Peak Shaving for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure-A Case Study in a Parking Garage in Uppsala, Sweden","The need for a more flexible usage of power is increasing due to the electrification of new sectors in society combined with larger amounts of integrated intermittent electricity production in the power system. Among other cities, Uppsala in Sweden is undergoing an accelerated transition of its vehicle fleet from fossil combustion engines to electrical vehicles. To meet the requirements of the transforming mobility infrastructure, Uppsala municipality has, in collaboration with Uppsala University, built a full-scale commercial electrical vehicle parking garage equipped with a battery storage and photovoltaic system. This paper presents the current hardware topology of the parking garage, a neural network for day-ahead predictions of the parking garage's load profile, and a simulation model in MATLAB using rule-based peak shaving control. The created neural network was trained on data from 2021 and its performance was evaluated using data from 2022. The performance of the rule-based peak shaving control was evaluated using the predicted load demand and photovoltaic data collected for the parking garage. The aim of this paper is to test a prediction model and peak shaving strategy that could be implemented in practice on-site at the parking garage. The created neural network has a linear regression index of 0.61, which proved to yield a satisfying result when used in the rule-based peak shaving control with the parking garage's 60 kW/137 kWh battery system. The peak shaving model was able to reduce the highest load demand peak of 117 kW by 38.6\% using the forecast of a neural network.",10.3390/wevj13080152,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/wevj13080152,15,high
maybe,,Decomposed Modeling of Controllable and Uncontrollable Components in Power Systems with High Penetration of Renewable Energies,"The high penetration of variable renewable energies requires the flexibility from both the generation and demand sides. This raises the necessity of modeling stochastic and flexible energy resources in power system operation. However, some distributed energy resources have both stochasticity and flexibility, e.g., prosumers with distributed photovoltaics and energy storage, and plug-in electric vehicles with stochastic charging behavior and demand response capability. Such partly controllable participants pose challenges to modeling the aggregate behavior of large numbers of entities in power system operation. This paper proposes a new perspective on the aggregate modeling of such energy resources in power system operation. Specifically, a unified controllability-uncontrollability-decomposed model for various energy resources is established by modeling the controllable and uncontrollable parts of energy resources separately. Such decomposition enables the straightforward aggregate modeling of massive energy resources with different controllabilities by integrating their controllable components with linking constraints and uncontrollable components with dependent discrete convolution. Furthermore, a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model based on the proposed model for power system operation is established. The proposed model is tested using a three-bus system and real Qinghai provincial power grid of China. The result shows that this model is able to characterize at high accuracy the aggregate behavior of massive energy resources with different levels of controllability so that their flexibility can be fully explored. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.",10.35833/MPCE.2020.000674,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.35833/mpce.2020.000674,15,high
maybe,,Modeling and evaluation of SOC-based coordinated EV charging for power management in a distribution system,"The importance of using clean energy in electrical energy generation and transportation network planning has recently increased due to carbon footprint rising. In this direction, the use of electric vehicles (EV), known as ultra-low carbon emission vehicles, has become widespread in addition to renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generations. The trend of EVs to be preferred the primary means of transport has revealed the effects of charging an additional load on the grid. There is a need to create coordinated charging methods by considering the approaches for real-time charging models of EVs. In this paper, SOC-based EV coordinated charging was proposed for power management to prevent adverse effects including transformer overload, instantaneous peak loading and line overload in the existing distribution network. The proposed coordinated EV charging method was tested on the modified Roy Billinton test system (RBTS) Bus 2 network. AC 11 kW uncoordinated charging units have been respectively 123.76% distribution transformer and 115.16% distribution line overloading for 500 EVs on the grid with 13,9% diversity factor. However, these values that are 72.05% of distribution transformer and 67.01% of distribution grid overloading according to permittable level were decreased by the proposed coordinated charging method. Also, the state of charge (SOC) based coordinated method can increase 3.5% rate the diversity factor of charging capacity at the charging station with PV and battery energy system (BES) while ensured grid stability and energy efficiency. © TÜBİTAK",10.55730/1300-0632.3805,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.55730/1300-0632.3805,15,high
maybe,,Strategic network expansion planning with electric vehicle smart charging concepts as investment options,"The electrification of transport seems inevitable as part of global decarbonization efforts, but power system integration of electric vehicles faces numerous challenges, including a disproportionately high demand peak necessitating expensive infrastructure investments. Moreover, long-term developments in the power sector are characterized by great uncertainty, which increases the risk of making incorrect investment decisions leading to stranded assets. A cost-effective system integration of electrified transport would therefore not be possible without the implementation of smart charging concepts in combination with strategic network expansion planning that considers the impact of uncertainties. This paper proposes investment and operation models of Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V), Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), and Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) for the large-scale and long-term network expansion planning problem under multi-dimensional uncertainty. Additionally, it presents a multi-stage stochastic planning framework that can identify optimal investment strategies such that the expected system cost is minimized and the risk of stranded investments is reduced. The models are demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus test system and applied in a case study of the power system of Great Britain. The results highlight G2V, V2G and V2B as effective non-network alternatives to conventional reinforcement that could generate substantial economic savings and act as hedging instruments against uncertainty. For the case of Great Britain, the Option Values of G2V, V2G, and V2B could amount to £1.2bn, £10.8bn, and £10.1bn, respectively, over a 40-year horizon.

maybe,,Optimal PV-EV sizing at solar powered workplace charging stations with smart charging schemes considering self-consumption and self-sufficiency balance,"The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems and electric vehicles (EVs) in the built environment, including at workplaces, has increased significantly in the recent decade and has posed new technical challenges for the power system, such as increased peak loads and component overloading. Several studies show that improved matching between PV generation and EV load through both optimal sizing and operation of PV-EV systems can minimize these challenges. This paper presents an optimal PV-EV sizing framework for workplace solar powered charging stations considering load matching performances. The proposed optimal sizing framework in this study uses a novel score, called self-consumption-sufficiency balance (SCSB), which conveys the balance between self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS), based on a similar principle as the F1-score in machine learning. A high SCSB score implies that the system is close to being self-sufficient without exporting or curtailing a large share of local production. The results show that the SCSB performance tends to be higher with a larger combined PV-EV size. In addition to presenting PV-EV optimal sizing at the workplace charging station, this study also assesses a potential SC and SS enhancement with optimal operation through smart charging schemes. The results show that smart charging schemes can significantly improve the load matching performances by up to 42.6 and 40.8 percentage points for SC and SS, respectively. The smart charging scheme will also shift the combined optimal PV-EV sizes. Due to its simplicity and universality, the optimal sizing based on SCSB score proposed in this study can be a benchmark for future studies on optimal sizing of PV-EV system, or distributed generation-load in general.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118139,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118139,15,high
maybe,,Quantifying the real-time energy flexibility of commuter plug-in electric vehicles in an office building considering photovoltaic and load uncertainty,"The widespread use of fluctuating renewable electricity has introduced challenges in balancing power systems. This can be alleviated by using flexible resources on the demand side to provide ancillary services at various timescales (e.g., day-ahead planning or real-time operation). However, practitioners lack a unified framework for measuring energy flexibility in the real-time operation frame. This study considers a control structure for clustered commuter plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in an office building with both day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch and proposes a generic quantification framework for assessing the capability of PEVs to manage the uncertainties of photovoltaic output and inflexible building load. Our evaluation considered the flexibility shortage in terms of power, energy, and control strategy, and the Monte Carlo method was used for probabilistic analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify the key factors determining real-time flexibility. The results suggest that 1.5–2 times the number of PEVs is required to meet the defined level of real-time flexibility rather than planning flexibility. Possible conflicts in flexibility enhancement at different timescales and directions were observed under various day-ahead scheduling strategies; prediction information can be used to mitigate conflicts in scheduling strategies and improve the overall control performance.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119365,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119365,15,high
maybe,,An optimization planning framework for allocating multiple distributed energy resources and electric vehicle charging stations in distribution networks,"In developing a sustainable and efficient power systems network while reducing carbon footprint, renewable energy (RE)-based Distribution Generation (DG) units are highly recommended. Furthermore, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and other passive electronic units are adopted to improve grid performance and mitigate the effects of high variability from RE power. Hence, planning frameworks are developed to optimally allocate these units to distribution networks. However, current planning mechanisms do not consider the relative effect of different allocated units in planning frameworks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel comprehensive planning framework for allocating DG units, BESS units, and Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) facilities in a distribution network while optimizing its technical, economic, and environmental benefits. The proposed framework uses a recombination technique to generate more solutions by dynamically updating the DG and BESS units’ locations in one iteration. A Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based algorithm is introduced to coordinate EV charging that suggests the optimal EVCS location in relation to other units’ locations. To cope with the complexity ensuing from searching a larger solution space, a multi-stage, hybrid optimization scheme is developed to produce optimal allocation variables. A category-based multiobjective framework is further developed to simultaneously optimize many objective functions — power loss, voltage stability, voltage deviation, installation and operation cost, and emission cost. Through numerical simulations on the IEEE 33- and 118-bus distribution network, it is shown that the proposed optimization scheme achieves higher metric values than the adopted benchmark optimization schemes. A validation process was also carried out on the proposed multiobjective optimization approach, comparing it with other approaches. Using the Spacing metric, the proposed approach proves to be efficient, depicting a good spread of Pareto optimal solutions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119513,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119513,15,high

However, while the most focus is on optimization algorithms and multi-objective techniques, little to no attention is paid to the underlying mechanisms in planning frameworks. This paper goes beyond existing literature by investigating the impact of planning mechanisms in smart grid planning frameworks when considering the allocation of PV distributed generation units, battery energy storage systems, capacitor banks, and electric vehicle charging station facilities. First, a single- and multi-objective planning problem is formulated. Then, we propose a novel adaptive-dynamic planning mechanism that uses a recombination technique to find optimal allocation variables of multiple DER and FACTS types. To cope with the additional complexity resulting from the expanded solution space, we develop a hybrid stochastic optimizer, named cooperative spiral genetic algorithm with differential evolution (CoSGADE) optimization scheme, to produce optimal allocation solution variables. Through numerical simulations, it is seen that the proposed adaptive planning mechanism improves achieves a 12% and 14% improvement to the conventional sequential (multi-stage) and simultaneous mechanisms, on small to large scale distribution networks.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.10.379,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.10.379,15,high

However, to integrate a massive fleet of EVs, it is crucial to properly build charging stations by considering the optimal geographical placement and number of charging spots. This task is particularly challenging for users with rigid schedules such as taxi drivers. Hence, an optimal siting and sizing approach for an electric taxi (ET) charging station is proposed in this study, considering both transportation and power system needs. In addition, particular attention to taxi drivers' needs is considered. Fixed installation costs, land costs, and trip costs are the factors evaluated in this proposed approach. A network modeling approach based on a winner-takes-all edge trimming was used to identify interest points of the city in terms of traffic flows.

maybe,,Estimation of Rwanda's Power System Inertia as Input for Long-term Dynamic Frequency Response Regulation Planning,"ABSTRACT Changes in the quota between conventional generation and renewable energy sources constitute major challenges that the modern power systems have to encounter. Conventional power plants are replaced by renewable generation (e.g. wind turbines, photovoltaics) that contribute to the reduction of power system inertia. This may introduce frequency stability issues because frequency is affected by the amount of system inertia, along with the response of controllable frequency reserves and the amount of power imbalance. Therefore, the estimation and analysis of power system inertia and the frequency response assessment is essential to ensure power system stability and security. This paper proposes a novel method to estimates the inertia constant for three different periods in future, namely, 2025, 2035 and 2050 based on the produced future energy scenarios (FES) for Rwandan's power system. In addition, the paper evaluates the frequency response dynamics for each scenario. Results show that the highest progression in renewable energy resources penetration resulted to a larger reduction in the system inertia constant (from 7.2 in control area 1 to 3.83s in control area 3) and the largest frequency drop was observed during the high progression scenario in the year 2050 where the PV and imported power penetration was expected to reach more than 30% of the total installed capacity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2022.107853,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2022.107853,15,high

In this paper, a model based non-cooperative game theory is developed to optimize the capacity configuration problem with wind power, PV power, and electric vehicles (EVs). The model is integrated with economic factors, such as electricity sales income, investments, and power supply reliability costs. An iterative search algorithm is used to solve the proposed game model, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to optimize the income of each player. Mixed integer multi-objective linear programming (MIMLP) is used to establish the representative days selection model of resources and load demands. To verify the rationality of the model, the grid-connected hybrid power generation system with different game participants and line transmission capacities was studied. Furthermore, the representative days results of the daily load rate and peak valley ratio generated by MIMLP are compared with those obtained using k-means clustering and a scenario reduction method.

With the rapid growth in EVs, there will be a tremendous potential to re-use the remaining EV battery capacities in power systems. Hence, this work focuses on capturing the economic benefits of using such second-life (SL) EV batteries. While previous works mainly focus on bulk storage applications, we demonstrate that the most beneficial route for SL batteries lies in distributed applications in power systems. Specifically, refurbishment and grouping of SL battery packs pose technical and operational challenges, thereby incurring significant costs and risks when large battery packs are adopted in bulk applications. Instead, when distributed at the residential and micro-grid level, such refurbishment costs and operation risks can easily be avoided as only small-size battery packs are required. An experimentally-validated model is incorporated to capture the battery capacity degradation and used to compare fresh batteries and SL-batteries.

This paper proposes a novel power flow analysis method considering both interval and probabilistic uncertainties, in which the probability box (P-box) model is established to investigate the power flow influenced by multi-type uncertainties. A probability-interval sample classification method combined with interpolation is proposed to achieve an accurate P-box representation of the power flow.

maybe,,Optimal allocation of renewable energy source and charging station for PHEVs,"Renewable energy forms have a comparatively less impact on the environment when compared with non-renewable sources. Renewable energies like wind power, biomass, hydropower, solar power, and geothermal energies are preferred for production as they do not run out quickly. Owing to the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) load demand, large-scale penetration of these resources from the power system affects the network performance like reduce power quality, increase power loss, and voltage deviation. These issues can be addressed by the optimum planning depending upon the variables outcome in RES to satisfy the extra demand affected by PHEV charging. At the same time, designing a proper and effective energy management strategy in PHEV can be considered an optimization problem and can be resolved by the use of metaheuristic algorithms. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel deep learning with metaheuristic optimization based allocation of RES and charging stations for PHEVs. The proposed model depends upon model predictive control (MPC) where the actual battery state of charge (SOC) is concerned with real time energy management. Moreover, the black widow optimization (BWO) algorithm is used for the optimal allocation of RES and charging stations. The BWO algorithm derives objective functions using different parameters of the charging stations. In addition, based on the MPC model, deep stacked autoencoder (DSAE) is applied for the prediction of near-future velocity.

maybe,,Can vehicle-to-grid facilitate the transition to low carbon energy systems?††Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/d2ya00204c,"ABSTRACT Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is when electric vehicles (EVs) provide services to the power grid, such as shifting when they charge or discharging to serve peaks loads. At scale, an aggregator can coordinate and optimize the charge and discharge of individual vehicles to function as a synergistic, bulk energy resource and load. Here we generate new insights into V2G's long run value for deep decarbonization, assessing its potential to displace stationary storage and other generators at scale. As a case study, V2G impact is measured via the buildout and operation of a New England-sized power system subject to high EV penetration and tight emissions constraints. We find V2G's effect on system capacity and value to be substantial, with participation from 13.9% of the New England light-duty vehicle fleet displacing 14.7 GW of stationary storage (over $700 million in capital savings). On the whole, total system savings span 2.2% to 20.3% ($183–1326 million) between participation rates of 5% and 80%, respectively. Savings are driven first by displacement of stationary storage, and second by reductions in firm generation capacity and shifts in renewable generation portfolios. When compared to traditional demand response schemes, even at modest participation rates (5–10%), V2G yields over 337% more savings and tenfold the storage displacement. V2G's marginal benefit is greatest under aggressive emission caps (10 gCO2 per kW per h per load), as it decreases the need for excess renewables capacity and costly CCS technologies. Further, the nature of optimal V2G dispatch is shown to change non-monotonically with participation rate. Below 50% participation, V2G power injection is called on at a higher rate to shave evening charging loads, with 21.3–32.8% of charge reinjected to the grid, whereas greater participation rates require significantly less reinjection (<15%) via charge load shifting.

maybe,,Central Aggregator Intrusion Detection System for Denial of Service Attacks,"Vehicle-to-grid technology is an emerging field that allows unused power from Electric Vehicles (EVs) to be used by the smart grid through the central aggregator. Since the central aggregator is connected to the smart grid through a wireless network, it is prone to cyber-attacks that can be detected and mitigated using an intrusion detection system. However, existing intrusion detection systems cannot be used in the vehicle-to-grid network because of the special requirements and characteristics of the vehicle-to-grid network. In this paper, the effect of denial-of-service attacks of malicious electric vehicles on the central aggregator of the vehicle-to-grid network is investigated and an intrusion detection system for the vehicle-to-grid network is proposed. The proposed system, central aggregator–intrusion detection system (CA-IDS), works as a security gateway for EVs to analyze and monitor incoming traffic for possible DoS attacks. EVs are registered with a Central Aggregator (CAG) to exchange authenticated messages, and malicious EVs are added to a blacklist for violating a set of predefined policies to limit their interaction with the CAG. A denial of service (DoS) attack is simulated at CAG in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network manipulating various network parameters such as transmission overhead, receiving capacity of destination, average packet size, and channel availability. The proposed system is compared with existing intrusion detection systems using different parameters such as throughput, jitter, and accuracy. The analysis shows that the proposed system has a higher throughput, lower jitter, and higher accuracy as compared to the existing schemes.",https://doi.org/10.32604/cmc.2023.032694,2022,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.32604/cmc.2023.032694,15,high

The location of DG sources and their capacity are the key factors in the effectiveness of distributed generation in the voltage stability of distribution systems. Nowadays, along with the scattered production sources of electric vehicles with the ability to connect to the network, due to having an energy storage system, they are known as valuable resources that can provide various services to the power system. These vehicles can empower the grid or be used as a storage supply source when parked and connected to the grid.

Therefore, electrifying the transportation system, such as the creation of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), has become essential to reducing the effects of carbon dioxide emissions and using less traditional energy supplies that are not ecologically friendly. PEV deployment must be flawless, necessitating a well-developed charging infrastructure. The best location for fast charging stations (FCSs) is a crucial issue. As a result, this article offers a practical method for choosing the best site for FCSs using the east delta network (EDN). When transportation is made electric, the infrastructure of the electrical distribution network may also need to be changed. Therefore, when adopting FCSs, three factors need to be considered: actual power loss, reactive power loss, and investment cost. The energy demand from the electrical grid is also increased by including FCSs in the power distribution network. To lessen the impact of FCSs on the system, this research report suggests integrating photovoltaic distributed generation (PVDG) at certain places in the distribution network. Consequently, the system becomes dependable and self-sustaining. After deploying the FCSs and PVDGs, the distribution system's dependability is also examined.

This paper presents a three-stage optimization of charging scheduling of EVs, which is based on the electricity price to guide charging selection of users and the continuous charging and discharging of EVs while scheduling. In first stage, the agents provide different charging modes for users to choose from, a charging selection model for users based on EV charging information and the time-of-use (TOU) electricity price is established. The arrival and departure time of EVs, state-of-charge (SOC) and TOU electricity price are all factors that affect users' charging selection. Differential group dispatching of EVs with different charging modes to realize the requirements of the power grid and users. In second stage, based on the charging selection of users and the charging information of EVs, the charging load in different periods can be predicted, which can guide the power purchase for charging agents. The third stage is the integrated charging scheduling of EVs. EVs dispatching is based on the priority, which takes the charge-discharge switching times of EVs into account. The model takes the maximum income of the charging agents as the objective and takes the requirements of the power grid and users as the constraints. Modified adaptive step size fruit fly optimization algorithm (MASSFOA) is utilized to optimize the TOU electricity price, and the optimized TOU electricity price is used to guide EV user's charging selection.

To promote greener EV charging practices, this study proposes the environmental time-of-use (E-ToU) which provides time-varying prices and GHG intensity signals. Specifically, in E-ToU, GHG intensity is used as a nudge to steer drivers’ charging behavior, providing a mixed financial-environmental incentive. Conjoint-based choice experiments were conducted with participation of 1220 South Korean drivers (including 129 EV owners) to simulate EV charging under this novel scheme. Unit commitment was utilized to determine time-varying prices and GHG intensity, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of E-ToU. The results indicated that both charging costs and GHG intensity influenced the charging decisions (timing) of EV users. The E-ToU shifted EV charging to renewable-abundant daytime, reducing EV charging costs by 14.1 % and GHG emission from EV charging by 15.7 %. Additionally, it reduced the generation costs by 2.2 %, GHG emissions by 1.5 %, and renewable energy curtailments by 2.5 % in the power system.

maybe,,Integration of mobile power-hydrogen storage systems in distribution-level networks: A fuzzy information gap optimization framework,"In recent years, renewable energy sources (RESs) have had unquestionably significant benefits. However, maximum penetration of RESs has always been challenging due to their intermittent nature. To address this challenge, this study advances a framework for the flexibility of the distribution network (DN) by employing transportable electrical storages (TESs) and transportable hydrogen storages (THSs). To do so, the TESs are considered to transfer electrical energy among high-penetrated and high-demand points. In addition, curtailed renewable power can be converted to green hydrogen and transferred to hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) using the THSs. To further flexibility, this work considers an incentive-based demand response (DR) program and vehicle-to-parking lot (V2PL) capable plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Moreover, a binary-based method is developed to carry out the trajectory planning of the TESs and THSs and the Floyd algorithm is exploited to minimize traveling and simulation time. Furthermore, the fuzzy information gap decision theory (IGDT) is proposed to enhance the scheduling robustness against the uncertainty of RESs. The obtained results corroborated the positive impact of the TESs and THSs by declining the operation cost by about 4.8 %. Moreover, the proposed uncertainty management model is quite robust against RESs’ uncertainty by achieving about 37.5 % less operation cost. © 2023",10.1016/j.scs.2023.105166,2024,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2023.105166,14,high
maybe,,Estimating the impact of electric mobility on distribution networks through GIS techniques,"This paper presents a novel GIS-based (Geographic Information System) approach, integrated with graph theory algorithms to predict the additional power demand from EVs (Electric Vehicles) on electric distribution grids. The energy consumption of an EV is primarily influenced by distance travelled, which is affected by factors such as traffic congestion and road network design. To consider all these factors, a weighted graph is constructed using the layout of Lombardy's traffic network in northern Italy. The traffic flow patterns are simulated utilizing a regional travel survey that provides the trips between the 1450 different travel zones of the region. The trips are simulated within the roads graph using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fastest paths. The spatial resolution of the trips’ origins and destinations is increased using a further sectionalization of the region and gravity model using GIS-empowered probability density functions. The output from the traffic simulation is overlaid with the service areas of primary substations to estimate the added load from EVs. This integration of the two layers enables the identification of when, where, and to what extent electric mobility will impact the electric distribution grids. The novelties of the research work encompass the following key contributions: modelling a large-scale and real-world transportation network represented in graph theory and integration with the corresponding primary substation service areas, consequently enabling the estimation of added load from EVs with a high spatial–temporal resolution. © 2024",10.1016/j.segan.2024.101379,2024,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2024.101379,14,high

Existing research on systemic low-carbon emissions and electric vehicle charging and discharging issues is usually determined by considering only carbon trading markets or charging and discharging management on the source side. In this regard, a coordinated and optimized operation model that considers the participation of electric vehicle clusters in deep peaking and the source network load and storage adjustable resources is proposed. The upper layer establishes a real-time price-based demand response mechanism for the load side with the minimum net load fluctuation as the objective function; the middle layer establishes a comprehensive operation mechanism for the source and storage side that includes an orderly charging and discharging peaking compensation mechanism for electric vehicles, and a deep peaking mechanism that takes into account clean emission, and constructs an optimal operation model with the minimum comprehensive operating cost as the objective function; the lower layer establishes a distribution network loss minimization model for the network side that takes into account the orderly charging and discharging of electric vehicle as the objective function. The optimal load model with the objective function of minimizing the distribution network loss is established at the lower level. Finally, the original problem is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming problem, and the model's effectiveness is verified by setting different scenarios. The model reduces the total cost by 22.22%, improves the wind power consumption rate by 19.55%, reduces the actual carbon emission by 16.66%, and reduces the distribution network loss by 13.91% compared to the basic model. © 2024 The Authors.

maybe,,Research on priority scheduling strategy for smoothing power fluctuations of microgrid tie-lines based on PER-DDPG algorithm,"The variability of renewable energy within microgrids (MGs) necessitates the smoothing of power fluctuations through the effective scheduling of internal power equipment. Otherwise, significant power variations on the tie-line connecting the MG to the main power grid could occur. This study introduces an innovative scheduling strategy that utilizes a data-driven approach, employing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve this smoothing effect. The strategy prioritizes the scheduling of MG's internal power devices, taking into account the stochastic charging patterns of electric vehicles. The scheduling optimization model is initially described as a Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing power fluctuations on the interconnection lines and operational costs of the MG. Subsequently, after preprocessing the historical operational data of the MG, an enhanced scheduling strategy is developed through a neural network learning process. Finally, the results from four scheduling scenarios demonstrate the significant impact of the proposed strategy. Comparisons of reward curves before and after data preprocessing underscore its importance. In contrast to optimization results from deep deterministic policy gradient, soft actor-critic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms, the superiority of the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with the addition of a priority experience replay mechanism is highlighted. © 2024 The Author(s).

The EV owners benefit from lower fuel and operating expenses compared to ICE vehicles because of higher efficiency of electric motors reaching it as high as 60-70\%. The electric vehicles are intermittent load to the grid since the number of users charging the electric vehicle at different charging station at different time. Moreover, the increasing EV penetration leads to the increase in load requirement on charging stations and will place a heavier load on the grid, necessitating the exploration of alternative resources. So, it significantly effects on power quality of the distribution grid. This charging requirement needs to be effectively managed to ensure uninterrupted energy supply for charging EVs batteries. By employing a basic charging plan, the estimated system cost per vehicle per year in Denmark is \$263. Implementation of smart charging, the system cost decreases to \$36 per vehicle per year, resulting in substantial savings of \$227 per vehicle per year. Controlled charging methods also effectively reduce system costs by 50\% and decrease peak demand.

However, the complexity that arises from the inherent instability and uncertainty associated with these measures affects power grids and significantly complicates the Unit Commitment Problem (UCP). This research paper introduces two unique optimization techniques which are the Main Arithmetic Approach (AOT) and the Modified Arithmetic Approach (IAOT) to address the optimal decisions for the UCP considering intermittent RENs and LDVs. The AOT exploits the statistical characteristics inherent in basic mathematical operators. Additionally, AOT leverages the probability distributions associated with fundamental mathematical operators to optimize its operations. Conversely, the proposed IAOT boosts effectiveness by harnessing the benefits of natural logarithms and exponential operators with high-density values for operator selection to produce a more flexible search process. Moreover, the IAOT takes advantage of the unique properties of natural logarithms and exponential operators with high-density values to achieve improved performance. Real power system data is utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis involving four distinct UCP case studies with twelve relevant scenarios ranging from SA1 to SF2 showing the low and prominent levels of penetration of LDVs in different seasonal conditions that incorporate uncertainties of RENs. The effectiveness of the elected approaches is examined through key performance indicators including the overall operating costs per day (OCD) and the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), considering distinct LDVs profiles and levels of RENs penetration. The study shows significant insights into the scenarios analyzed. Scenario SF1 - IAOT is the most cost-effective alternative, with OCD of 528,430, closely followed by SB1 - IAOT, which costs 529,550. Conversely, Scenario SD2 - AOT has the greatest OCD of 559,667. Furthermore, the CER and OCD offer useful insights.

Random installation of EVCs may cause voltage disturbances, power quality disturbances and power losses in the distribution network. The hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm algorithm (HGAMSSA) was used to determine the optimal EVCs placement in the distribution network by considering power losses, network capacity and voltage regulation. HGAMSSA is a combination of GA and MSSA. In the first stage, the GA method distributes the population randomly and the second stage crosses the membership between dimensions. In the third stage, MSSA processes the best population from the GA to determine the best objective function. The HGAMSSA incorporates Optimal Power Flow (OPF) calculations based on Newton-Raphson. The OPF simulation uses a modified 20kV IEEE 33 bus distribution network. For validation, HGAMSSA was compared with four different algorithms: GA, PSO, SSA, and MPSO. There are three test scenarios with populations of 100, 50, and 20. As a result, the power loss generated as the best objective function wase 0.15715 MW.

To optimize IWPT, parameters like the shape and size of ferrite cores and coils and the weight of cores are supposed to be prioritized. Researched data depicts that Double-D (DD) coils excel in misalignment tolerance, low flux leakage, and high coupling with respect to circular and rectangular coils. Therefore, this article examines the four different shapes and sizes of ferrite cores for DD coils at the Tx and Rx sides. This work considers the Rectangular-type, S-type, D-type and I-type ferrite-bars. Further, the ANSYS Maxwell 3D is used to analytically observe the coupling coefficient, losses and energy transfer for each structurally different core.

One significant solution to meeting this energy demand is the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) in power systems. However, integrating RESs has made the construction of power systems more complex. Moreover, Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) stand out as a highly promising technology for reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector, aligning with the global Net-zero target.

In this paper, we address the OPF problem that arises from power systems with a high penetration of controllable renewable sources and PEVs. We simulate uncertain solar irradiance, wind speed, and PEV behavior using Weibull, lognormal, and normal probability distribution functions (PDFs) respectively. The proposed stochastic OPF problem, which incorporates controllable renewable sources and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, is addressed using the hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm (AHMRFO).

To address this issue, EV charging control strategies have been developed to manage the switch between vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) modes for EVs. In this context, multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has proven its effectiveness in EV charging control. However, existing MADRL-based approaches fail to consider the natural power flow of EV charging/discharging in the distribution network and ignore driver privacy. To deal with these problems, this article proposes a novel approach that combines multi-EV charging/discharging with a radial distribution network (RDN) operating under optimal power flow (OPF) to distribute power flow in real time. A mathematical model is developed to describe the RDN load. The EV charging control problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) to find an optimal charging control strategy that balances V2G profits, RDN load, and driver anxiety. To effectively learn the optimal EV charging control strategy, a federated deep reinforcement learning algorithm named FedSAC is further proposed.

This paper identifies three important gaps in current literature. First, the upper-bounding issue of the tariff-based incentives (road toll, charging service fee, etc) is not well addressed, which might raise drivers’ dissatisfaction or compromise system performance. Second, the TN-PDN cooperation is generally built upon a simple assumption without any guarantee on its existence or stability. Third, the autonomy of network operators in tariff setting, operating goals, and data privacy is overlooked in prevailing bi-level social-cost-minimization frameworks. To bridge the above research gaps, this article proposes a novel tri-level framework where a social entity (SE) at the upper level sets the tariff bound towards the lowest social cost and dispenses subsidies towards a stable TN-PDN cooperation, network operators at the middle level jointly manage TNs and PDNs towards the optimal status, and travelers at the lower level decide charging&route choices to minimize individual travel cost. Cooperative Game Theory is adopted to characterize the cooperation and cost allocation between the middle-level operators, while the Core size is introduced to quantify the coalition stability and to guide the SE’s subsidization. A slope-identification based algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the tri-level problem in a privacy-preserving manner, and a geometric analysis is conducted to deduce the Core size and the required subsidies.

This paper uses a novel optimization technique to solve the problem of simultaneous optimal placement of EVCS with network reconfiguration and optimal planning (siting and sizing) of DGs and DSTATCOMs. The multiple objective functions are considered in order to minimize the active power losses, the voltage deviation, the investment costs for DGs and DSTATCOMs, and to increase the voltage stability of the system. A novel meta-heuristic Cheetah Optimization Algorithm (COA) is used to solve the optimization problem. To examine the effectiveness of the suggested strategy on 33-bus and 136-bus networks, several scenarios of simultaneous incorporation of EVCS, DG, and DSTATCOM installations with network reconfiguration are taken into consideration. The COA results are also compared to the results of grey wolf optimization and genetic algorithms. © 2024, University of Kragujevac Faculty of Technical Sciences in Cacak.

This paper firstly establishes a whole life cycle model applicable to the distribution grid energy storage system, which fully considers the various types of costs of VSC converter stations. Secondly, for comprehensive reactive power optimization, a sequential quadratic programming algorithm is used, and inequality constraints are added to the objective function in the form of penalty functions to optimize the state of on-load transformers and capacitors. Finally, the effectiveness of its distribution grid energy storage configuration optimization is verified by applying the distribution grid energy storage optimization based on the quadratic programming algorithm to electric vehicle charging piles. The results show that after two stages of optimization, the configuration capacity of distribution grid energy storage is increased by 53.14Kw/h compared with that before optimization, which is a substantial increase. The average annual cost of battery 0' access decreases by 0.275, and battery 2' access decreases by 0.581.

maybe,,Simulation-Based Hybrid Energy Storage Composite-Target Planning with Power Quality Improvements for Integrated Energy Systems in Large-Building Microgrids,"In this paper, we present an optimization planning method for enhancing power quality in integrated energy systems in large-building microgrids by adjusting the sizing and deployment of hybrid energy storage systems. These integrated energy systems incorporate wind and solar power, natural gas supply, and interactions with electric vehicles and the main power grid. In the optimization planning method developed, the objectives of cost-effective and low-carbon operation, the lifecycle cost of hybrid energy storage, power quality improvements, and renewable energy utilization are targeted and coordinated by using utility fusion theory. Our planning method addresses multiple energy forms—cooling, heating, electricity, natural gas, and renewable energies—which are integrated through a combined cooling, heating, and power system and a natural gas turbine. The hybrid energy storage system incorporates batteries and compressed-air energy storage systems to handle fast and slow variations in power demand, respectively. A sensitivity matrix between the output power of the energy sources and the voltage is modeled by using the power flow method in DistFlow, reflecting the improvements in power quality and the respective constraints. The method proposed is validated by simulating various typical scenarios on the modified IEEE 13-node distribution network topology.

Along with increasing network voltage deviations, this can also lower the quality of the power provided. By placing EV fast charging stations (FCSs) in strategic grid locations, this issue can be resolved. Thus, this work suggests a new methodology incorporating an effective and straightforward Red-Tailed Hawk Algorithm (RTH) to identify the optimal locations and capacities for FCSs in a real Aljouf Transmission Network located in northern Saudi Arabia. Using a fitness function, this work's objective is to minimize voltage violations over a 24 h period. The merits of the suggested RTH are its high convergence rate and ability to eschew local solutions. The results obtained via the suggested RTH are contrasted with those of other approaches such as the use of a Kepler optimization algorithm (KOA), gold rush optimizer (GRO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and spider wasp optimizer (SWO). Annual substation demand, solar irradiance, and photovoltaic (PV) temperature datasets are utilized in this study to describe the demand as well as the generation profiles in the proposed real network. A principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the complexity of each dataset and to prepare them for the k-means algorithm. Then, k-means clustering is used to partition each dataset into k distinct clusters evaluated using internal and external validity indices. The values of these indices are weighted to select the best number of clusters. Moreover, a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is applied to probabilistically determine the daily profile of each data set. According to the obtained results, the proposed RTH outperformed the others, achieving the lowest fitness value of 0.134346 pu, while the GRO came in second place with a voltage deviation of 0.135646 pu.

The paper considers the advantages of using the grey GM(1,1) prediction model to predict the short-term ownership of EVs by urban residents. Then, by forecasting the number of EV users in a certain city in the future and predicting the number of private vehicles in the future, the boundary conditions for long-term year ownership of EVs by residents are determined.

maybe,,An Effective Strategy for Achieving Economic Reliability by Optimal Coordination of Hybrid Thermal-Wind-EV System in a Deregulated System,"This paper describes an effective operating strategy for electric vehicles (EVs) in a hybrid facility that leverages renewable energy sources. The method is to enhance the profit of the wind-thermal-EV hybrid plant while maintaining the grid frequency (fPG) and energy level of the EV battery storage system. In a renewable-associated power network, renewable energy producers must submit power supply proposals to the system operator at least one day before operations begin. The market managers then combine the power plans for the next several days based on bids from both power providers and distributors. However, due to the unpredictable nature of renewable resources, the electrical system cannot exactly adhere to the predefined power supply criteria. When true and estimated renewable power generation diverges, the electrical system may experience an excess or shortage of electricity. If there is a disparity between true and estimated wind power (TWP, EWP), the EV plant operates to minimize this variation. This lowers the costs associated with the discrepancy between actual and projected wind speeds (TWS, EWS). The proposed method effectively reduces the uncertainty associated with wind generation while being economically feasible, which is especially important in a deregulated power market. This study proposes four separate energy levels for an EV battery storage system (EEV,max, EEV,opt, EEV,low, and EEV,min) to increase system profit and revenue, which is unique to this work. The optimum operating of these EV battery energy levels is determined by the present electric grid frequency and the condition of TWP and EWP. The proposed approach is tested on a modified IEEE 30 bus system and compared to an existing strategy to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.

In this context, the present study employs real-world datasets to propose a comprehensive spatial–temporal energy model that integrates a traffic model and geo-referenced data to realistically evaluate the flexibility potential embedded in the light-duty transportation sector for a given study region. The methodology involves assessing traffic patterns, evaluating the grid impact of EV charging processes, and extending the analysis to flexibility services, particularly in providing primary and tertiary reserves. The analysis is geographically confined to the Lombardy region in Italy, relying on a national survey of 8.2 million trips on a typical day. Given a target EV penetration equal to 2.5%, corresponding to approximately 200,000 EVs in the region, flexibility bands for both services are calculated and economically evaluated.

However, the random charging characteristics of plug-in electric vehicles and the uncertainty of photovoltaics may impose an additional burden on the grid and affect the supply–demand equilibrium.

In pure electric vehicles, frequent starting and braking conditions lead to a reduction in battery lifespan. The adoption of an “electric-hydraulic” hybrid power system can effectively mitigate this issue. However, the increase in vehicle mass due to the integration of hydraulic systems may affect the overall efficiency of the vehicle. In this study, we integrated a hydraulic energy storage system into a mid-sized pure electric sport utility vehicle (SUV), forming an “electric-hydraulic hybrid” power system. By comprehensively consider factors such as the extension of battery life, mass increase and energy efficiency, a multi-objective problem for the hydraulic energy storage system’s parameters was formulated. The optimization objectives include minimizing battery degradation, reducing the total weight of the energy storage system, and decreasing overall vehicle losses under typical operating conditions. The key parameters of the hydraulic energy storage system and the torque distribution coefficients over typical operating time profiles were considered as the optimization variables. A genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the system parameters, resulting in a Pareto front of the solutions for the hydraulic energy storage system and torque distribution parameters.

Finally, the DSOs examine if they can deliver these power transactions without congestion in their DSs, by applying AC OPF to minimize power losses. If this is not possible, then a relaxation scheme is applied to these power transactions in order to define the maximum DSO flexibility without congestion in the DS.

maybe,,Inventory management of battery swapping and charging stations considering uncertainty,"The battery swapping mode of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to play an essential role in transportation and power systems. Plenty of batteries are managed by the battery swapping and charging stations (BSCSs) as the core assets. Proper inventory scale and charging/discharging control of batteries are essential to the planning and operation of BSCSs. This paper addresses two critical aspects of BSCS batteries: the optimal amount of inventory batteries and the tradeoff between the initial number of depleted and fully-charged batteries at the beginning of each scheduling horizon. Aiming at these, the time coupling between initial inventory, charging/discharging strategy, and swapping time sequence is analyzed. Afterward, it establishes the initial inventory based charging/discharging (IIC) model. The uncertain swapping demand is fully considered by utilizing a data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach with an improved K-means clustering algorithm. A duality-free column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm solves the problem iteratively. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the IIC model and show that the obtained optimization results achieve the balance of economy and robustness.

maybe,,Optimal location of FACTS devices with EVCS in power system network using PSO,"The appeal of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is steadily growing, driven by the numerous advantages they offer to both owners and the environment. However, this surge in EV adoption places an increasing demand on the power system network for electric charging. The consequential strain on the power system may lead to instability and potential contingencies within the network. To mitigate these challenges, this paper recommends the installation of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices. Specifically, two types of FACTS devices, Static Var Compensator (SVC) and Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), are employed to enhance the stability and loading conditions of the power system network. The study focuses on an IEEE 39 bus system network chosen for the installation of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). The objective is to assess the maximum loading factor of each bus within the network. This paper introduces a methodology for determining the optimal locations for both EVCS and FACTS devices. Notably, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to optimize the size of FACTS devices and associated installation costs, ensuring an efficient and cost-effective enhancement to the power system's stability and loading conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prime.2024.100482,2024,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prime.2024.100482,14,high

Installation of EVCS in the present power system network without modification can cause an extra burden on the present network. However, this extra burden can be reduced if EVCS gets a supply of renewable energy resources. This paper proposes energy management schemes by installing a photo-voltaic distributed generator (PV-DG) and energy storage system (ESS) at an EVCS. An IEEE-33 bus system for the Saudi Arabia United Kingdom rural location has been selected to introduce real-time energy management schemes. In this radial distribution network (RDN), three EVCS of different capacities are installed at different locations to maintain the stability of the network. The power flow program is used in the MATLAB environment to check the stability of the network. Accurate solar data, traffic patterns, and EV charging patterns in Saudi Arabia are collected and used for energy management at EVCS.

maybe,,Electromagnetic interference and the effect of low-voltage protective measures at electric vehicle charging stations; Elektromagnetische Beeinflussung und die Wirkung von Niederspannungsschutzmaßnahmen bei Ladestationen für Elektrofahrzeuge,"The nominal power of electric vehicle charging stations or charging parks is constantly increasing. Most of the users are ordinary persons and handle such equipment with a rated power of several 100 kW. Until now, equipment with such power ratings was only common in electrical operating facilities such as industrial plants where the users are at least instructed and protective measures are specified. If ordinary persons handle equipment with such power ratings in the field, the question arises as to whether the conventional safety goals are met in the event of an electrical fault. The consideration is: If the power increases so much, it can be assumed that the short-circuit power and thus the fault current increase and so does the risk of a dangerous electric shock. In this contribution, calculations of line-to-earth short-circuits on the low-voltage AC side of the three-phase system and their effects in typical configurations of charging stations are carried out. Considering the electromagnetic interference, the calculations provide the fault current and its distribution to determine the electrical potentials during the fault. From this, the (partial) fault voltages and active fault voltages are calculated. Based on the active fault voltage, the expected body impedance and consequently, the body current can be determined. With the body current and the break time of the protection device the risk of electric shock using international standards as guidelines is evaluated. As a result, recommendations for the planning, installation and safe operation of charging stations are given. It turns out that considering certain aspects like the conductor cross-sections or the electromagnetic interference, the risk of electric shock can be reduced to a conventional level. Periodic testing of the electrical system is necessary for safe and reliable operation. For example, follow-on faults due to unintended, improper use by ordinary persons can be prevented. Also, regular inspection of the electrical system is necessary for safe and reliable operation to prevent hazards due to aging or wear. However, it seems challenging to define an installation guideline that applies to all configurations as the boundary conditions vary depending on the type of system, installations in the area of interference and environmental influences. © 2023, The Author(s).",10.1007/s00502-023-01180-y,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s00502-023-01180-y,14,high

maybe,,Intelligent decision optimization for energy control of direct current power distribution system with multi-port access for intelligent buildings,"The structure of direct current (DC) appliances is simpler and more energy-efficient than that of alternating current (AC) appliances. With the proliferation of novel DC loads (e.g., e-bikes and electric vehicles), DC loads will dominate the loads in buildings. It is necessary to develop a DC power distribution method that better accommodates renewable energy, effectively improves the working efficiency of loads, and significantly enhances energy utilization efficiency. However, there is not yet a unified design for the multi-port converter of DC microgrids. The experience is severely lacking in the overall energy planning for buildings from the perspectives of economy and environmental friendliness. To solve the problems, this paper explores the intelligent decision optimization for energy control in DC power distribution system with multi-port access for intelligent buildings. Firstly, a feature analysis was carried out on the multi-port converter of the DC power distribution system for intelligent buildings. With economy and environmental friendliness as the goals, the authors designed constraints related to energy output power, power balance, and distribution node voltage, and established an intelligent decision optimization model for the energy control of the DC microgrid for intelligent buildings. The model was combined with the multi-attribute decision-making framework into a decision-making framework for the coordinated operation of distributed energy supply units, which is based on the interval evidential reasoning (IER). Finally, the authors proposed an evaluation method for the decision-making of the energy control of DC power distribution for intelligent buildings, based on the Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operator, and the IER-based decision-making framework.

maybe,,Co-planning of hydrogen-based microgrids and fuel-cell bus operation centers under low-carbon and resilience considerations,"The hydrogen-driven fuel-cell electric buses, which bear the advantages of emission free, high storage content and long mileage range, provide a promising choice for decarbonizing the public transportation system. Also, the operation centers for fuel-cell electric buses can be upgraded as the hydrogen-based microgrids to achieve higher economic benefits and resilience levels. To support the low-carbon and resilience-oriented planning of microgrid-aided bus centers, this paper presents a two-stage robust optimization formulation with integer corrective decisions. In particular, the first-stage problem is to optimize the microgrid siting decisions as well as the capacity configuration of renewable-powered electrolyzers, fuel-cell stacks and hydrogen refueling stations for maximizing the annualized benefits. Then, a min–max problem is introduced in the second-stage to improve the load survival value subject to the planning decisions and the worst-case contingency scenario. Also, various corrective actions, e.g., the emergency response of fuel-cell electric buses using vehicle-to-grid functionality, the energy scheduling of stationary equipment in hydrogen refueling stations and the adaptive network reconfiguration, are considered for resilience enhancement of the local power network. As the resulting robust optimization formulation is with a challenging mixed-integer recourse structure, the nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is designed. Numerical results on exemplary power network and public transportation system validate the effectiveness of the proposed planning methodology, which has the potential to be profitable under normal operations while improving the load survivability under severe disastrous occasions. Moreover, our customized nested column-and-constraint generation shows a satisfactory solution performance, which facilitates prompt disaster relief actions of energy-transportation network. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120849,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120849,14,high

It is necessary to consider it as a significant charging method in future urban scenarios. The development of EVs and charging facilities has brought about the electrification of transportation, forming a power-traffic system. To maximize the comprehensive performance of the system, this paper proposes a planning strategy for the coexistence of static and dynamic charging facilities. First, considering the response of vehicle users in the transportation network to the planned results, we design a bi-level optimization framework. Then, in the lower-level optimization model, taking into account the charging demands of different vehicles, we construct a multi-class user equilibrium model and adopt a modified adaptive path generation algorithm and a variable update factor algorithm to solve the traffic assignment problem. In the upper level, we utilize an evaluation indicator to indicate the comprehensive performance of the system, and the evaluation indicator is minimized under constraints on the capacities, charging prices, and usage prices of hybrid charging facilities. Then, an algorithm based on the surrogate model is introduced to solve the bi-level programming.

maybe,,An improved encoder-decoder-based CNN model for probabilistic short-term load and PV forecasting,"Integrating distributed energy resources (DER) such as distributed generation, demand response, and plug-in electric vehicles is one of the major causes of fluctuating and unpredictable operating states in electric distribution systems. Therefore, distribution utilities must carry out anticipated operational planning to achieve appropriate and efficient network management. Then, it is necessary to obtain more accurate load forecasts on higher granularity levels than those commonly supervised by the SCADA system, for instance, at distribution transformers. Furthermore, as medium/low voltage profiles are more volatile and uncertain than high voltage profiles and, therefore, more difficult to predict, there is an opportunity to improve their performance at this level. This work proposes a short-term net load forecast model that considers load consumption and PV distributed generation behind the meter. This model is based on an efficient deep learning network that uses novel techniques and architectures implemented in other tasks adapted to the net electric load forecasting problem at an individual and/or low-aggregated level. At the same time, the model can consider information provided by exogenous variables of time and meteorological ones to improve the forecast accuracy. Additionally, the proposed model is extended to a probabilistic approach through Monte Carlo Dropout and kernel density estimation to obtain probability density forecasts. To evaluate the model performance, a dataset from the “Caucete Smart Grid” located in Argentina is used. The results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model through several cases and comparisons with the state-of-the-art models considered. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.epsr.2023.109153,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2023.109153,14,high

A microgrid is an energy system that supplies electricity to customers with renewable and fossil generation sources. Therefore, the main goal of this work in optimal planning of energy hubs includes how to distribute products such as combined energy and heat sources, hydrogen storage systems, electric vehicles, and controllable loads to examine the role of demand side management and renewables. This research study also aimed at minimizing the cost of power generation in the following hours or days, as well as the spread of environmental pollution. Since various sources of uncertainty such as load, energy price in the wind turbine, and solar cell output power market affect the microgrid's economic optimization, this research study is covered by probabilistic modeling. The hydrogen storage system includes an electrolyzer, hydrogen tanks, and a fuel cell. We apply the load-side response program to flatten the load diagram and optimize the microgrid use. As this model has different objective functions, a multi-objective random algorithm was proposed to solve it. Finally, the proposed model and method for a sample system in different scenarios are discussed. Based on obtained results from all scenarios, the first case reduced the operating cost by 20.75 % and 15.17 % compared to the second and third cases.

maybe,,Methods for increasing the potential of integration of EV chargers into the DC catenary of electric transport grids: A trolleygrid case study,"The traction substations of urban electric transport grids are oversized and underutilized in terms of their capacity. While their over-sizing is an unfortunate waste, their under-utilization creates the major hurdle for the integration of renewables into these grids due to the lack of a base load. Therefore, integrating smart grid loads such as EV chargers is not only an opportunity but a necessity for the sustainable transport grid of the future. This paper examines six methods for increasing the potential of EV chargers in three case studies of a trolleygrid, namely a higher substation no-load voltage, a higher substation power capacity, a smart charging method, adding a third overheard parallel line, adding a bilateral connection, and installing a multi-port converter between two substations. From the case studies, the most promising and cost-effective method seems to be introducing a bilateral connection, bringing a charging capacity for up to 175 electric cars per day. Meanwhile, other costly and complex methods, such as smart charging with grid state sensors and communication, can offer charging room for over 200 electric cars per day. Furthermore, using solar PV systems to power the grid showed a more than doubling of the directly utilized energy by installing a 150kW charger, from 19% to 41%. This reduces the power mismatch between the trolleygrid and the PV system from 81% to 59% and thereby reduces the severe economic need for storage, AC grid power exchange, or PV power curtailment while allowing a high penetration of renewables. © 2023 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.etran.2023.100271,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.etran.2023.100271,14,high

A smart grid achieves such aforementioned power supply by ensuring resilient energy delivery, which presents opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of power supply and minimize environmental impacts. A systematic evaluation of the comprehensive benefits brought by smart grid to smart cities can provide necessary theoretical fundamentals for urban planning and construction towards a sustainable energy future. However, most of the present methods of assessing smart cities do not fully take into account the benefits expected from the smart grid.

By classifying and reintegrating the needs, an evaluation index system of smart grids supporting smart cities was further constructed. A case analysis concluded that smart grids, as an essential foundation and objective requirement for smart cities, are important in promoting scientific urban management, intelligent infrastructure, refined public services, efficient energy utilization, and industrial development and modernization.

One of the key challenges facing power companies operating within this context is effectively planning power production across multiple production technologies. To address this challenge, this study employs fuzzy set theory and proposes a combinatorial optimisation approach for the problem of power generation planning. The planning process is considered as a multi-period optimisation task where uncertain factors in each period are considered as fuzzy variables. The credibility expected value and the lower semi-variance in the final production value are considered as the return and risk objectives of the problem, respectively. Then, a bi-objective optimisation model with complex constraints under the influence of political factors is proposed. A hybrid intelligent algorithm based on fuzzy simulation, artificial neural network and multi-objective genetic algorithm is developed to solve the model. A numerical example in the Chinese energy market is tested to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results highlight seasonal variation in the profits and risks of each production technology. From a practical perspective, the proposed approach can help decision-makers to establish multi-period production planning. Additionally, this study analyses the optimal production planning for companies under different levels of renewable energy and carbon emission standards. The results show that the proposed approach can reflect the influence of these policy factors on utilities’ production decisions, which provides certain guidance for regulators to formulate appropriate policies. © 2023 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.rser.2023.113209,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.rser.2023.113209,14,high

Accordingly, the development of a home energy management system (HEMS) is urgently required to support residential consumers in consuming energy efficiently, achieving high satisfaction levels, and meeting grid specifications. Previous studies have only suggested simple HEMS models with one or two optimized objectives. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming paradigm for a comprehensive HEMS model which fully utilizes the vehicle-to-home and home-to-grid capabilities, while optimizing the energy cost, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), and discomfort index (DI). Also, an integration method of the augmented ɛ-constraint with lexicographic optimization is presented for effectively addressing any multi-objective HEMS problems. The proposed approach is validated across different simulations using both deterministic and stochastic models. The simulation results reveal that the energy costs and PAR can be reduced by 47.96% and 55.24%, respectively, whereas the DI is maintained at a minimum value. Extensive simulations related to the storage capacity, solar photovoltaic sizing, and uncertainty parameters are also analyzed.

These scenarios have been considered using the time series method of data determination and correlation. Due to the high number of scenarios and the increase in the volume of calculations, the scenario reduction method is used, then several scenarios with the highest probability of occurrence are selected and optimization is done.

The problem is formulated as a novel two-stage planning problem. The first stage determines the locations and sizes of the DGs with locations of EVCSs in grid-connected scenario, whereas the second stage planning identifies the optimal islands under the islanded microgrid scenario. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is applied to solve the first stage planning problem; in this stage, the algorithm minimizes two objective functions: the system-losses and total cost. In the second stage, another single objective optimization problem is designed which minimizes supply voltage variations to find optimal islands for the DGs and EVCSs to ensure a secure supply of power for EVs. The proposed framework is implemented on the IEEE 33-bus system and verified with four test cases.

maybe,,Mitigation of Complexity in Charging Station Allocation for EVs Using Chaotic Harris Hawks Optimization Charge Scheduling Algorithm,"The development of EV technology and EV migration is limited by various factors such as sizing of batteries, short driving ranges, optimal operations, and so on. The EV charging faces many difficulties such as waiting time, charging time, uneven charge scheduling, and uneven distributed charging stations. In Charging Station (CS), EVs usually spend much time in queues, mainly during peak hours of charging. Therefore, building a well-established charging station network should be derived from charging demand and proper charge scheduling to assist EVs for getting charged with less cost, less waiting time. Also, it should reduce the number of vehicles scheduling during the peak load time. This work aims to design a scheduling system for EV charging using an optimization strategy of Chaotic Harris Hawks optimization (CHHO) which reduces the total time spent on charging station and the distance of EV origin to destination.

In the event of major natural disasters, the functioning capabilities of active distribution systems (DS) face ongoing problems. To assess the resilience of a distribution system, a thorough methodology must be established. This study proposes a methodology that demonstrates how the use of EMGs and DERs, in conjunction with line hardening, can improve resilience in extreme operating situations. The framework examines four separate scenarios, each with its own set of restoration procedures and critical loads. A combination of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), solar photovoltaic distributed generation (SPV-DG), battery energy storage systems (BESS), and distribution static compensators (DSTATCOMs) is being integrated into practical Indian distribution systems consisting of 28 and 52 buses to improve resilience. The goal is to improve the newly specified resilience indices and restore all of the loads that have been affected by the faults.

The OSB is considered to support the grid under fast charging loads. By the proposed approach, the impact of operational planning on reliability is identified. The main operational parameters considered in the reliability analysis include the charging load power and the charging- and discharging scheduling of the OSB. A hierarchical reliability framework is established where the failure rates of the components are estimated based on the FIDES methodology for physics-of-failure-based reliability prediction. Then, a dynamic failure threshold is introduced to translate the component failure consequences to the system performance into three states - failed, normal, and de-rated operation. Hence, the failure threshold is obtained for a specific set of operational and system design parameters. Additionally, to benchmark the characteristics of the SoC profiles of the OSB, an operation-based battery lifetime analysis is conducted. The evaluation of system-level reliability and on-shore battery lifetime is carried out for a 4MW dc S2SC system with a specified range of operation parameters. The results show that batteries and the IGBTs in the power electronics converters are the most reliability-critical elements. Moreover, it is apparent from the results that adjustments to the OSB power profile planning can potentially improve the reliability of the system for specific system sizing.

The increasing demand for lower weight and higher conversion efficiency is opening new challenges, encouraging the adoption of new technologies (e.g., wide bandgap semiconductor devices). In particular, the DC-link capacitor typically represents the bulkiest inverter component, posing a strict limitation to the achievable converter power density and thus being subject to great pressure for improvement. In this context, novel ceramic capacitor technologies (e.g., PLZT) promise superior performance with respect to well established film-based solutions, featuring both higher specific capacitance and higher RMS current capability. Therefore, this article focuses on the analysis, sizing, design, and experimental assessment of a PLZT-based ceramic DC-link capacitor for next-generation EV drive inverters, including a comparative assessment with a state-of-the-art film-based solution. In particular, in view of the non-linear behavior of the PLZT capacitance value with respect to the DC-bias voltage and the amplitude of the excitation, a novel correlation between the effective large-signal capacitance and the peak-to-peak voltage ripple is derived experimentally, providing useful information for the DC-link capacitor sizing (i.e., not available from the capacitor manufacturer). For verification purposes, a full-scale DC-link capacitor prototype for a SiC MOSFET 800 V, 550 kVA, and 20 kHz drive inverter is realized, demonstrating superior power density (i.e., $\approx$ two thirds smaller and $\approx$ one third lighter than a corresponding film-based solution).

The DC side of the PV-DSTATCOM is also utilized for an EVCS, drawing power from PV source or the distribution grid based on PV availability and demand at a given time. The point of common coupling (PCC) of the PV-DSTATCOM is determined by the proposed method for IEEE-38 bus system. It uses modal analysis with sensitivity indices to assess the voltage stability and find critical buses where PV-DSTATCOMs can be placed to improve the overall network stability. The method also combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) for optimal sizing of the PV-DSTATCOM with EVCS provision. In addition, this work proposes a dynamic pricing scheme using an adaptively trained artificial neural network (ANN) for EVCSs to effectively manage demands during peak hours (thereby improving network stability) and benefit EV users in terms of charge per kWh of electricity depending upon the present state of charge (SOC) of their vehicle battery and the level of congestion at EVCS.

To address the strategic interaction between entities, a bi-level mixed integer program is formulated, with the CSP/FO’s problem expressed in the upper/lower levels respectively, in a joint decision making process. These decisions involve the CSP’s infrastructure siting, sizing, substation capacity upgrades, the FO’s fleet composition, vehicle routing, charging, and delivery assignment. To solve the problem, an iterative fashion is adopted to solve and reach optimality.

Further, active power curtailment of RESs is precluded while considering the diverse operational constraints of the grid, RESs, and EVCSs.

The Fuel Cells (FCs) systems benefit from high efficiency and zero emissions, and they are generally powered by hydrogen. One of the main problems related to hydrogen FCs is the current weak network of infrastructure’s need to supply the hydrogen itself. An alternative may be the development of FC vehicles powered by methane, or biomethane, to exploit a renewable energy source. The type of Fuel Cells that lends itself to a methane (or biomethane) power supply is the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). Considering the limitations of the SOFCs, a vehicle model powered by Fuel Cells fueled by methane (or biomethane) is created. This work concerns the creation of a vehicle model, and the sizing of the SOFC system (generator delivering a constant 3 kW) and battery pack (30 Ah), for a door-to-door waste collection vehicle, whose mission is known. The latter is a fundamental requirement due to the limitations found for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: slow transient and long ignition times. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/en16134918,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en16134918,14,high
maybe,,Design and Analysis of a Peak Time Estimation Framework for Vehicle Occurrences at Solar Photovoltaic and Grid-Based Battery-Swappable Charging Stations,"Due to global environmental impacts, the electric vehicle (EV) adoption rate is increasing. However, unlike conventional petrol vehicles, EVs take a considerable time to charge. EVs on the road with different battery charging statuses and driving demographics may cause uncertain peak time arrivals at charging stations. Battery-swappable charging stations are a quick and easier way to replace uncharged batteries with charged ones. However, charging due to uncertain EV arrival causes higher charging profiles posing load to the grid, management of charged and discharged batteries, and peak time charging tariffs. These challenges hinder the wide operation of battery-swappable charging stations. Nevertheless, a pre-assessment of peak hours using EV demographics can reduce congestion. In recent literature surveys for battery-swappable charging stations, spot congestion has not been given much attention, which has a direct influence on the sizing and operation of battery-swappable charging stations. This research study is focused on estimating peak time events using a novel integrated techno-economic assessment framework. A fuzzy-based parametric assessment tool is developed that identifies the factors that influence higher congestion events. Based on the peak event assessment, grid, and solar PV-based generation is optimized using mixed integer linear programming. In the final step, an environment analysis of a swappable charging station is performed. Furthermore, the results achieved using the proposed framework for battery-swappable charging stations (BSCSs) were compared with fast-charging (FC) stations. FC can economically perform well if integrated with solar PV systems; however, the capital cost is 80% greater than the BSCSs designed under the proposed framework. The operational cost of BSCSs is 39% higher than FC stations as they use 29% higher grid units than FC stations due to night operations under congestion. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/su152316153,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/su152316153,14,high

In order to predict the BEVs charging demand, an application that takes into account the random user’s arrival time and the initial battery state of charge (SOC) was developed using the C++ programming language and the Qt toolkit. The network analysis was then carried out using the Quasi-Dynamic Simulation (QDS) toolbox in DIgSILENT PowerFactory on a typical German LV grid for a metropolitan urban area. The simulation findings indicate that the value of simultaneity factor (SF) plays an important role in identifying the most robust and weakest grid’s bottlenecks. There is currently no immediate threat of electromobility pushing the parameters of the grid to their unacceptable limits; however, it is essential to examine the LV grid’s bottlenecks and gradually prepare them for the ramp-up of BEVs. In the short term, the bottlenecks can be removed using conservative planning and operating principles; however, employing novel approaches will be crucial in the longer term. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/wevj14070165,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/wevj14070165,14,high

Therefore, distribution utilities must carry out anticipated operational planning to achieve appropriate and efficient network management. Then, it is necessary to obtain more accurate load forecasts on higher granularity levels than those commonly supervised by the SCADA system, for instance, at distribution transformers. Furthermore, as medium/low voltage profiles are more volatile and uncertain than high voltage profiles and, therefore, more difficult to predict, there is an opportunity to improve their performance at this level. This work proposes a short-term net load forecast model that considers load consumption and PV distributed generation behind the meter. This model is based on an efficient deep learning network that uses novel techniques and architectures implemented in other tasks adapted to the net electric load forecasting problem at an individual and/or low-aggregated level. At the same time, the model can consider information provided by exogenous variables of time and meteorological ones to improve the forecast accuracy. Additionally, the proposed model is extended to a probabilistic approach through Monte Carlo Dropout and kernel density estimation to obtain probability density forecasts. To evaluate the model performance, a dataset from the “Caucete Smart Grid” located in Argentina is used.

One of the most widely used electric vehicles is the electric train. Thus, energy optimization becomes more crucial in electrical railways to reduce consumption and total electricity bill as well as environmental issues. Consequently, electrical railway energy management must be technically and economically efficient and effective. This paper proposes an energy efficiency optimization framework for intelligent railway stations that provide plug-in electric vehicle charging parking capacity use, renewable energy sources (REs), and regenerative braking energy (RBE).

While their over-sizing is an unfortunate waste, their under-utilization creates the major hurdle for the integration of renewables into these grids due to the lack of a base load. Therefore, integrating smart grid loads such as EV chargers is not only an opportunity but a necessity for the sustainable transport grid of the future. This paper examines six methods for increasing the potential of EV chargers in three case studies of a trolleygrid, namely a higher substation no-load voltage, a higher substation power capacity, a smart charging method, adding a third overheard parallel line, adding a bilateral connection, and installing a multi-port converter between two substations. From the case studies, the most promising and cost-effective method seems to be introducing a bilateral connection, bringing a charging capacity for up to 175 electric cars per day. Meanwhile, other costly and complex methods, such as smart charging with grid state sensors and communication, can offer charging room for over 200 electric cars per day. Furthermore, using solar PV systems to power the grid showed a more than doubling of the directly utilized energy by installing a 150kW charger, from 19% to 41%. This reduces the power mismatch between the trolleygrid and the PV system from 81% to 59% and thereby reduces the severe economic need for storage, AC grid power exchange, or PV power curtailment while allowing a high penetration of renewables.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etran.2023.100271,2023,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etran.2023.100271,14,high

A smart grid achieves such aforementioned power supply by ensuring resilient energy delivery, which presents opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of power supply and minimize environmental impacts. A systematic evaluation of the comprehensive benefits brought by smart grid to smart cities can provide necessary theoretical fundamentals for urban planning and construction towards a sustainable energy future. However, most of the present methods of assessing smart cities do not fully take into account the benefits expected from the smart grid. To comprehensively evaluate the development levels of smart cities while revealing the supporting roles of smart grids, this article proposes a model of smart city development needs from the perspective of residents’ needs based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory, which serves the primary purpose of building a smart city.

The only challenge facing the use of new energies is the uncertainty in their production due to the lack of sunlight and wind blowing continuously at different hours of the day and night. In this article, the problem of planning the flexibility of electric vehicle charging and discharging to coordinate with wind and solar production and to compensate for the uncertainty of these resources has been solved using the CPLEX solver. Also, in this article, the flexibility of charging and discharging of electric vehicles has been used to coordinate with wind and solar production and compensate for the uncertainty of these sources. In addition, the EVs (Electric Vehicles) are planned in such a way that the operating cost of the microgrid is minimized. To consider the uncertainty related to loading, wind, and solar production, different scenarios have been considered and programming in R language has been done. These scenarios have been considered using the time series method of data determination and correlation. Due to the high number of scenarios and the increase in the volume of calculations, the scenario reduction method is used, then several scenarios with the highest probability of occurrence are selected and optimization is done.

maybe,,Transmission expansion planning in presence of electric vehicles at the distribution level,"The planning of the transmission network is an issue that, over the years, has received much attention, particularly due to the impact that this infrastructure has on the safe and reliable functioning of electrical systems. The search for solutions addressing climate change has led to several changes in the functioning of electrical systems, particularly concerning the increasing integration of renewable electricity production. However, in recent years, changes in the load side of the electrical system have also emerged. In particular, electric mobility has been developing, and a high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected in near future. This consumption is supplied by the distribution system but will impact the transmission network. Naturally, the amount of energy used by EVs is subject to uncertainties, which makes the problem complex. Those uncertainties cannot be easily modeled using statistical distributions because of the reduced history of available information. The transmission system operator (TSO) needs an efficient tool to analyze the adequacy of the transmission network to supply the distribution networks with high penetration of EVs. In this paper, a methodology based on symmetric/constrained fuzzy power flow is proposed to find the optimal investment policy at the transmission level while satisfying the technical constraints. The concept of dual variables provided by Lagrange multipliers, the natural result of the nonlinear optimization problem, is used to obtain the most promising reinforcement options considering the actual structure of the transmission network.

These factors include the increasing share of decentralized energy generation and storage systems in distribution networks, the integration of electric vehicles, the coupling of electrical and thermal systems, as well as the increasing and easy use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The primary actors in this situation, formerly known as consumers of energy and power, have now become prosumers (producers and consumers), who feed energy back into the network at specific times. Hybrid energy systems combine cross-sectoral energy sources and supply systems as well as energy distribution and storage to form one compact system. The aim is to substitute fossil energy sources with primarily renewably generated electricity, other renewable energy sources, and sustainable ways of energy usage. Moreover, the use of new meter functions and services enables market-dependent dynamic or special consumer- and prosumer-oriented tariffs. A simulation model has been developed to model, simulate, and analyze the behavior and steady-state energy flows of such hybrid energy systems. By using linear optimization algorithms, the optimal use of decentralized energy generation and storage systems is determined in the example of a single-family house.

Previous research always focuses on single optimization process on shared vehicle planning, rather than the combination of demand management into day-ahead planning operations. To this end, we attempt to propose a mixed integer programming model integrating demand response operations to further explore the impacts of demand response on shared electric vehicle planning operations. We first model a two-stages model integrating charging facility location in the first stage and vehicle relocation in the second stage. Moreover, both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties are considered and approximated into tractable form by applying sample average approximation and distributional robust set featuring the entropy knowledge and electric vehicle's multi-level charging duration. The demand response policy is also proposed to reshape the original charging demand into an economical and reliable way to improve operational efficiency and mitigate the power overload issues caused by massive electric vehicle adoption.

This work aims to identify the role of the electrification of transportation from a perspective of the mid-to-long term. The main focus is on the coupling of the deployment of electric vehicles (EV) and power system decarbonization. The paper combines a detailed bottom-up model for the road transportation sector, which features a detailed classification of vehicle types, with the EnergyPLAN tool, a cross-sector and cross-region energy system model of future scenarios consisting of different planning strategies and vehicle charging modes.

maybe,,Security-Constrained generation and transmission expansion planning based on optimal bidding in the energy and reserve markets,"The increasing growth of power system demand causes different challenges for the network operation and security situation. Therefore, this paper presents security-constrained generation and transmission expansion planning (SCGTEP) according to a strategic bidding model in the energy and reserve markets. This method includes a bi-level optimization problem, where its upper level refers to the transmission company (TransCo) and generation company (GenCo) economic model. This level minimizes the difference between TransCos and GenCos costs and revenues in the energy and reserve markets subjected to allowed investment budget for transmission lines and generation units. Moreover, the lower level problem considers the energy and reserve market-clearing model based on AC security-constrained optimal power flow. In other words, this problem minimizes the summation of network operation and security costs limited to the linearized AC optimal power flow equations, reserve formulation of generation units, load shedding model due to N - 1 contingency, and linearized voltage stability constraints. In the next step, the single-level SCGTEP is achieved using the KarushKuhn-Tucker, and it is solved by the Benders decomposition approach to obtain an optimal solution at a low calculation time. This strategy includes the uncertainties of load, renewable generation power, and the availability of the network equipment, hence, scenario-based stochastic programming is used in this paper to model uncertain parameters. The proposed SCGTEP is tested on the 6-bus and 118-bus IEEE networks in the GAMS software. According to the obtained numerical results, the proposed strategy can be simultaneously improved operation and security indices about 34.5\% and 100\%, respectively, compared to the power flow analysis based on the optimal location of generation units and transmission lines.

maybe,,Comprehensive classifications and characterizations of power system flexibility resources,"Due to the increasing integration of renewable forms of generation, ageing network infrastructure, and rapid increase in peak load demand, flexibility is becoming economically more viable and hence significant role player in the future power system. There is vast amount of literature on flexibility covering research, demonstration and validation activities. Nevertheless, there is still no unifying definition of the term ``flexibility{''} and consistent characterizing terms for ``flexibility resources{''}. The lack of clarity in definitions and concepts may undermine information exchange amongst stakeholders imposing hurdles on the transition from mature technology to in-vestment decisions and deployment. System operators, for example, require better clarity for the techno-economic evaluation of flexibility resources in their planning processes. This paper, by reviewing prominent flexibility-related publications, proposes a comprehensive flexibility definition and unified characterizing terms for flexibility resources. Furthermore, the paper proposes a taxonomy method which is applied to classify flexibility resources. The presented taxonomy method clears the confusion on ``what-is-what{''} under the concept of flexibility.

maybe,,A comprehensive optimization framework for EV-Renewable DG coordination,"This paper develops an optimization framework for coordinating electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) in distribution systems. A bilateral contract between EV aggregators and renewable distributed generators (DGs) is first used to maximize revenues for these market participants by optimally controlling EV charging/discharging. The developed market-based EV control model is then implemented in a distribution system and evaluated for its potential adverse effects on the system operation. An optimal capacitor sizing and placement method is proposed to resolve the negative impacts of such control model. The proposed capacitor optimization method along with the developed EV control model provides an EV-RES coordination framework that simultaneously addresses both market and operational objectives. A real distribution network is used to test the EV-RES coordination method and evaluate its performance for different loading conditions using three-phase unbalanced load flow calculations. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in not only providing cost savings for the system operation, but also in reducing the losses and voltage deviations that would be otherwise incurred due to uncoordinated EV scheduling. The proposed EV-RES coordination framework is demonstrated to ensure economic, safe and reliable operation of distribution systems in which EVs and renewable DGs synergize. © 2021",10.1016/j.epsr.2021.107086,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2021.107086,14,high
maybe,,Optimal location of EV charging stations in a neighborhood considering a multi-objective approach,"Despite the environmental and economic benefits of Electric Vehicles (EVs), distribution network operators will need to understand the location where the charging infrastructure will be placed to ensure EV users’ needs are met. In this sense, this work proposes a methodology to define the optimal location of EV semi-fast charging stations (CS) at a neighborhood level, through a multi-objective approach. It applies a hierarchical clustering method to define CS service zones, considering both technical and mobility aspects. Besides, it considers uncertainties related to the EV load profile to determine the CS capacity, based on the user's charging behavior. A Pareto Frontier method is deployed to support the decision-making process on CS optimal location, considering utility and EV users’ preferences. The results indicate that the best CS locations for mid-term EV penetration can also fit into long-term planning, with higher EV charging demand. Thus, these locations would be good candidates for the power utility to make initial investments, regarding both planning horizons.

Optimal planning avails itself of the exploitation manner of existing energy resources alongside appropriate employment of demand response (DR) programs and available electric vehicles (EV) in parking lots of immense industrial centers as storage sites in energy management systems in industrial smart grids have been seriously considered. This article introduces a new perspective in the simultaneous use of demand response loads and available electric vehicles in parking lots toward energy management of industrial virtual power plants (IVPPs) aiming at augmenting the system's profits as well as increasing the grid reliability under peak load conditions and cutting down on industrial centers load shedding. The objective function of the problem is formulated within the framework of short-term production planning for distributed energy resources (DER) and conventional ones in conjunction with DR programs and EV in such a way that the IVPPs' profits are maximized. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we have applied and tried on the second zone of IEEE-RTS standard grid. The outcomes accrued from various simulations point to the fact that the presence of EV within the boundaries of EV's parking lots prompts considerable increase in IVPPs' storage amount and consequent decline in exploiting full power grid capacity. Utilizing DR programs for responding load and selecting best scheduling schemes for each IVPP during various times of a day-night cycles will bring about a reduction in operation costs, de-peaking as well as an enhanced performance of EV's parking installations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.est.2021.102951,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2021.102951,14,high

An islanding operation is one such unavoidable situation that may be required in many cases for both technical and economic reasons. First and foremost, this paper focuses on the determination of the best allotment of Interline-Photovoltaic (I-PV) system as per Electric Vehicle (EV) load penetration in the network.

maybe,,Optimal Design of Electric Vehicle Parking Lot based on Energy Management Considering Hydrogen Storage System and Demand Side Management,"Basically, a system is associated with uncertainty and it is the existence of such a factor which results in an uncertain planning and designing. In today's power system, these conditions are mostly reasoned through the uncertain performance of a number of parameters e.g. price, so the use of uncertainty modeling becomes necessary. In the present work, an optimization model, based on virus search colony, is used for the optimal performance of intelligent parking of electric vehicles in uncertainty situations caused by the price of the upstream grid in the demand response (DRP) program. It has been used to reduce the daily cost of performance by changing various parts of the load between peak and off-peak intervals. Virus Colony Search (VCS) method is a method based on the random-based population, which is also based on specific behaviors of the virus. Chaos theory has been used to develop this algorithm and improve local and global search. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective algorithm is a model based on non-dominated sorting model, variable detection, memory-based strategy selection and fuzzy theory to select the best Pareto from the answer set. Besides, it has a powerful function in solving the above problem. Regarding the mentioned techniques, the possibility of being in local points is reduced and the speed of convergence to the final response is increased. The proposed method was investigated on a sample system including, intelligent parking, local units, thermal and renewable plants in the proposed upstream grid price uncertainty technique.

We apply the model to a case study assuming European power sector decarbonization towards 2060 according to a 1.5 degree scenario, and we investigate the impact of coupling building heat systems and electric vehicle charging in Norway with the European power market. The case study focuses on the role of Norway in a European perspective because: (1) Norwegian electricity production is mainly based on flexible and renewable hydropower, (2) Norwegian building heating systems are currently mainly electric, and (3) Norway is already introducing electric vehicles at large. We focus on the European power market to test our hypothesis that it is more cost-efficient to decarbonize when the central power system is coordinated with building heat systems and electric vehicle charging. For Europe as a whole, results show that the average European electricity cost reduces by 3% and transmission expansion decreases by 0.4% when Norwegian heat systems are developed in coordination with the European power system. The average Norwegian electricity cost decreases by 19%.

The proposed model contains a two objective problem that the first objective function minimizes the construction and operation costs of resiliency sources (RSs) and, in the second objective function, the minimization of the expected energy not supplied (EENS) due to the outage of the system against the mentioned natural disasters is formulated. Also, the proposed model is constrained to linearized AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equations, the planning and operating of RSs constraints such as generation units, hardening transmission lines, parallel and series FACTS devices, resiliency constraints and power system angular stability against earthquakes and floods in the presence of critical and non-critical loads. In order to achieve the best compromise response, the RCGTEP single-objective problem is formulated based on the epsilon constraint-based Pareto optimization. In addition, this model has the uncertainty of RSs availability against natural disasters, so stochastic programming is used for RCGTEP. Then, the Benders decomposition (BD) method is used to solve the proposed problem and achieve the optimal solution in the shortest possible time.

maybe,,Boosting integration capacity of electric vehicles: A robust security constrained decision making,"Global electric vehicles (EVs) fleet is expanding at a rapid pace. Considering the uncertain driving pattern of EVs, they are dynamic consumers of electricity and their integration can give rise to operational problems and jeopardize the security of the power system. Under such circumstances, the implementation of demand-side response (DSR) programs is more likely to be an effective solution for reducing the risks of load curtailment or security problems. This study proposes a voltage stability constrained DSR-coordinated planning model for increasing the penetration level of EVs in a distribution system consisting of photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs) and responsive loads. The uncertainties of PV/WT generation, the driving pattern of EVs, and load demand are modeled by an improved form of information gap decision theory (IGDT), hereafter called weighted IGDT (WIGDT).

Recently, some studies found electric vehicles that receive fast-charging service may also bring much air pollution due to fossil-fuel fired power generation. Hence, depending on the power generation mix, electric vehicles may have adverse environmental impacts. The current studies of fast-charging station planning only focus on power system planning and often ignore other parts of the transportation system such as internal combustion engine vehicles and gasoline stations. Moreover, most the current studies lack a comprehensive planning strategy for the fast-charging station that involves elements above simultaneously. In this context, an interdisciplinary study is implemented on the coordinated planning strategy of the fast-charging station in coupled transportation and power distribution systems. The proposed strategy with a multiple objective integer model can measure the impact of air pollutions from electric vehicles on air quality and human health in different areas. Considering the traffic flow assignment, the driving range logic constraints are used. The branch flow model is applied to power distribution systems. To measure the impacts of air pollutions on air quality and human health, the air pollution from the Road traffic model, the Gaussian Plum Model and the C-R function are adopted. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the proposed strategy and the mathematical model. The fast-charging station location and size can be determined by the mathematical model.

These challenges are further amplified in the case of a highly urbanised and densely populated small island state, like Singapore, with limited space and options for electricity sector planning. In response, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of a large-scale EV deployment on the electricity sector from a whole-system perspective with focus on investments in the power sector for EV adoption, assuming minimum deployment of advanced “smart-grid” and “vehicle-to-grid” technologies. Findings suggest that a small-scale deployment of EVs below 20% replacement can be economically manageable. A large-scale of deployment of EVs would inevitably bring a notable impact to the electricity sector regardless the state of advanced technology development.

Flexible loads are the key in the concept of demand response and, if well-planned, can save significant costs and emissions through optimal use of energy resources. On the other hand, fast charge electric vehicles, despite their appeal, represent a special type of loads demanding an immediate attendance upon admission to charging stations. This may counterbalance the efforts toward flexible load management. Moreover, there is a rising demand for fast-charge stations with a more balanced spatial distribution. In this paper, a comprehensive multi-stage residential load planning scheme is proposed incorporating the most diverse load groups in a realistic market environment. Within this procedure, a unique concept is implemented which taps into the aggregated residential load flexibility to support fast charge of electric vehicles. Through cluster-wise scheduling for different load classes, the proposed approach aggregates the flexibility of a heterogeneous population of different multi-apartment loads including air conditioning and water heating devices as well as slow-charging EVs to also plan for fast-charge-powered EVs.

The proposed rule-based methodology contrasts the net present value and benefits of four planning alternatives: network reinforcements, EV charging point management, and their combinations. Uncertainties are catered for by adopting a Monte Carlo approach. Using two real UK LV networks and realistic time-series data, results demonstrate the importance of a holistic decision-making approach. From an economic perspective, EV management is better for voltage issues, and reinforcements for thermal problems. However, when customer effects are considered, the management can lead to unacceptable charging delays. Combinations, on the other hand, provide trade-offs between cost and the effects on customers or carbon emissions. © 2020 The Authors.

maybe,,Joint Planning of a Distribution System and a Charging Network for Electric Vehicles,"The spatial-temporal distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging loads can be improved by implementing optimized charging scheduling, and by the joint planning of a distribution network (DN) and a charging network of EVs. In this paper, such a joint planning scheme was studied and modeled as two-level optimization model. In the upper level of the optimization, a joint planning model of a DN and a charging network of EVs with distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems and/or energy storage (ES) units is constructed to minimize the total cost. Then the optimized results of the DN and the EV charging network construction plan are used as the inputs of the lower-level operation model. In the lower-level operation optimization, an optimal charging scheduling approach is proposed to minimize the sum of the DN's operation cost and the traffic congestion cost. The spatial-temporal distribution of the charging demand, under an optimized charging strategy, is used as feedback for the upper-level optimization model, which effectively can reduce the scale of the DN and the charging network construction. The proposed joint planning model was demonstrated through applications in a city in China. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)EY.1943-7897.0000734,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1061/(asce)ey.1943-7897.0000734,14,high

maybe,,On the Feasibility of Load-Changing Attacks in Power Systems during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The electric power grid is a complex cyberphysical energy system (CPES) in which information and communication technologies (ICT) are integrated into the operations and services of the power grid infrastructure. The growing number of Internet-of-things (IoT) high-wattage appliances, such as air conditioners and electric vehicles, being connected to the power grid, together with the high dependence of ICT and control interfaces, make CPES vulnerable to high-impact, low-probability load-changing cyberattacks. Moreover, the side-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate a modification of electricity consumption patterns with utilities experiencing significant net-load and peak reductions. These unusual sustained low load demand conditions could be leveraged by adversaries to cause frequency instabilities in CPES by compromising hundreds of thousands of IoT-connected high-wattage loads. This article presents a feasibility study of the impacts of load-changing attacks on CPES during the low loading conditions caused by the lockdown measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. The load demand reductions caused by the lockdown measures are analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), focusing on the March-to-July 2020 period and the New York region as the most impacted time period and location in terms of load reduction due to the lockdowns being in full execution. Our feasibility study evaluates load-changing attack scenarios using real load consumption data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and shows that an attacker with sufficient knowledge and resources could be capable of producing frequency stability problems, with frequency excursions going up to 60.5 Hz and 63.4 Hz, when no mitigation measures are taken. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047374,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2020.3047374,14,high

The impact of the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has been examined by considering DG system with solar and wind power generation.

With the continuous increase of the temperature-controlled load and the proportion of electric vehicle load in the urban power grid, the complexity of the load side in the restoration process gradually increases. Therefore, based on the existing grid environment, this paper considers the sudden increase in load recovery caused by cold load pick-up and the auxiliary effect of electric vehicle discharge on load recovery during the load recovery process.

maybe,,Planning Flexibility with Non-Deferrable Loads Considering Distribution Grid Limitations,"Non-deferrable loads equipped with distributed energy resources, such as solar photovoltaic generation and energy storage, can offer a wide range of benefits to the power system, including load leveling, hedging against forecast uncertainty, and ancillary services. This paper presents a techno-economic approach to optimally equip a flexible energy resource, namely a battery energy storage system (BESS), with non-deferrable loads for capacity enhancement of a distribution grid. The proposed approach is generic in applicability, and includes two different optimization mathematical models. The first model quantifies the needed flexibility with non-deferrable loads, based on a consideration of distribution grid limitations, while the second model determines the optimal flexibility amount associated with non-deferrable loads considering investor profitability. Thereafter, a distribution operations model is developed to evaluate the impact of non-deferrable loads, equipped with an optimal size of BESS, on the distribution system loading capacity. An example of non-deferrable loads considered in this paper is that of the rapid charging loads of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that cannot be controlled or shifted due to the short stay of PEVs at a charging facility. Hence, a probabilistic model for PEV rapid charging loads is first developed. Case studies and simulation findings, considering a 32-bus distribution system, demonstrate that the proposed approach helps reduces the impact of non-deferrable loads on a distribution system and enhances the system power margin, which defers the need for system upgrades. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3057553,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2021.3057553,14,high

Optimal allocation of battery energy storage systems for distribution networks based on probabilistic power flow (PPF) is an effective solution to deal with these uncertainties. However, the high computational burden is the main obstacle of this method. Therefore, this paper proposes a surrogate-assisted multi-objective probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) to reduce the expensive computational time. The surrogate model is developed by using a machine learning method namely deep learning which is used for bypassing the deterministic load flow calculation. Zhao's point estimation method combined with Nataf transformation is selected to handle the PPF analysis considering correlated uncertain input variables. The multi-objective POPF problem is solved using the multi-objective differential evolution. The historical data including solar irradiation, ambient temperature, residential load, and electric vehicle (EV) travel distance is calculated in the low voltage distribution system to demonstrate the potential advantages of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed surrogate assisted multi-objective POPF method provides the optimal solution for operating cost, helps to prolong transformer life and reducing environmental impact.

We analysed the probability distribution of energy consumption and its relation to indicators characterising charging events to gain basic insights. The energy consumption can be satisfactorily modelled by a transformed beta distribution and the number of charging transactions is the driving factor among the characteristics constituting the energy consumption. We collected geospatial datasets and prepared a large number of candidate features modelling the spatial context in which the charging infrastructure operates. Using statistical methods, we identified and interpreted a relatively small subset of the most influential features correlated with energy consumption. The majority of these features are related to the economic prosperity of residents. Residents and businesses with high (low) income, situated nearby charging infrastructure, are linked to a positive (negative) impact on energy consumption. Similarly, charging infrastructure located close to expensive newly built housing shows higher energy consumption. The largest adverse impact has the high concentration of residents receiving social assistance. By applying the methodology to a specific charging infrastructure class, e.g. determined by the used rollout strategy, we differentiated the selected features. Business types, working sector of residents and public venues in the proximity are linked to higher consumption of energy at charging infrastructure deployed strategically. Characteristics linked with the age structure of the population are linked to the energy consumption at charging infrastructure placed based on the demand.

Accurate evaluation of the number of EVs penetrating the distribution network, that is, the hosting capacity (HC) of EVs, is beneficial to distribution network planning and efficient operation. Further, EVs have uncertainties in terms of arrival time, departure time, battery state of charge (SOC), and choice of charging station, which collectively affect the system difficult, but important, step of modeling EV uncertainties on system performance. This paper presents a methodology to model how many EVs can penetrate a low voltage distribution network, especially microgrid. First, EV load modeling incorporating uncertainties is performed by applying interval and affine arithmetic. Second, to analyze the effects of voltage, the same arithmetic methods are extended to perform power flow calculation. Thirdly, interval undervoltage probability (IUP) is introduced to evaluate the HC of the EVs. Subsequently, a voltage violation index (VVI) is introduced, and an EV HC evaluation method is proposed, assisting in the flexible operation of the network based on VVI.

maybe,,ADMM-Based Coordination of Electric Vehicles in Constrained Distribution Networks Considering Fast Charging and Degradation,"Acting as a key to future environmentally friendly transportation systems, electric vehicles (EVs) have attached importance to develop fast charging technologies to accomplish the requirement of vehicle users. However, fast charging behaviors would cause degradations in EVs’ batteries, as well as negative effects like new demand peak and feeder overloads to the connected distribution network, especially when plugging in large scale EVs. Decentralized coordination is encouraged and our goal is to achieve an optimal strategy profile for EVs in a decentralized way considering both the need of fast charging and reducing degradations in batteries and the distribution network. In this article, we innovatively model the EV fast charging problem as an optimization coordination problem subject to the coupled feeder capacity constraints in the distribution network. The need of fast charging is expressed by the total charging time, and the relative tendency to fully charge within the desired time period. We introduce a $\ell _{0}$ -norm of the charging strategy which is non-convex to represent the total charging time, and apply the $\ell _{1}$ -norm minimization to approximate the sparse solution of $\ell _{0}$ -norm minimization. The shorter the charging horizon is the stronger willing of fast charging the user has. The objective of the optimization problem tradeoffs the EVs’ battery degradation cost, the load regulation in the distribution network, the satisfaction of charging and the total charging time, which is non-separable among individual charging behaviors. Even though alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely applied in distributed optimization with separable objective and coupled constraints, its decentralized scheme cannot be applied directly to the underlying non-separable EV charging coordination problem. Hence, a hierarchical algorithm based on ADMM is proposed such that the convergence to the optimal strategies is guaranteed under certain step-size parameter.

maybe,,A Stochastic Optimal Planning Model for Fully Green Stand-Alone PEV Charging Stations,"Electric vehicle users need access to recharging services within the all-electrical driving range of their vehicles. However, public charging stations to be located on remote highways are in many cases far from the power grid, where a connection to the power grid may be impossible, costly, or impractical. This article formulates a stochastic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) planning model for energy storage and renewable energy systems to cover the energy demand of stand-alone charging stations for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) entirely using green energy generated by renewable energy sources (RESs). The proposed model accounts for the stochastic behavior of PEVs and RESs as well as the technical, economic, and operational characteristics of a variety of energy storage technologies. A customer satisfaction criterion is introduced to allow for a tradeoff between performance and investment costs. The proposed model can also be used for designing fully green PEV charging stations in urban and rural settings to capitalize on PEV environmental benefits by avoiding the use of fossil-fuel-generated electric power in their charging or to reduce the main grid load. A set of numerical studies have been performed in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) environment to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2015 IEEE.",10.1109/TTE.2021.3069438,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tte.2021.3069438,14,high
maybe,,Li-ion battery and supercapacitor modeling for electric vehicles based on pulse - Pseudo random binary sequence,"Energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors are arousing a growing interest in many areas of industrial applications since they allow improving the dynamic response and efficiency. In this sense, the availability of electric models of batteries and supercapacitors is necessary for the correct sizing, control, and energy management of power systems. In order to identify the parameters of the equivalent electric model, the identification current profile is often a pulse of charge or discharge. Subsequently, these models are validated with a current verification profile. However, the verification profile compared to the identification profile is more dynamic in amplitude and frequency, producing validation errors due to the identification signal's limited bandwidth. This paper proposes a novel Pulse - Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (Pulse - PRBS) identification current profile, with similar spectral characteristics to the verification profile, in order to improve the modeling accuracy. The parameters of a Lithium-ion battery and a supercapacitor are obtained with this new identification current profile and the Optimization Toolbox of Matlab, using the electrical models in Simulink or Simscape. Finally, the models are validated with the Urban Driving Cycle ECE-15 and the Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) for electric vehicle applications. © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/TVT.2021.3112284,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tvt.2021.3112284,14,high

Electric cars are some advanced technologies that their optimized use can increase grid efficiency. The modern electric cars sometimes, through the necessary infrastructure and proper management, can serve as an energy source to supply grid loads. This study was conducted to investigate the energy management for production and storage resources. For this purpose, we considered the market price of energy, the prices quoted by distributed generation sources, and electric vehicles in the grid and responsive loads.

maybe,,Electric Vehicles Charging Management System for Optimal Exploitation of Photovoltaic Energy Sources Considering Vehicle-to-Vehicle Mode,"The growing penetration of distributed renewable energy sources (RES) together with the increasing number of new electric vehicle (EV) model registrations is playing a significant role in zero-carbon energy communities’ development. However, the ever-larger share of intermittent renewable power plants, combined with the high and uncontrolled aggregate EV charging demand, requires an evolution toward new planning and management paradigms of energy districts. Thus, in this context, this paper proposes novel smart charging (SC) techniques that aim to integrate as much as possible RES generation and EV charging demand at the local level, synergically acting on power flows and avoiding detrimental effects on the electrical power system. To make this possible, a centralized charging management system (CMS) capable of individually modulating each charging power of plugged EVs is presented in this paper. The CMS aims to maximize the charging self-consumption from local RES, flattening the peak power required to the external grid. Moreover, the CMS guarantees an overall good state of charge (SOC) at departure time for all the vehicles without requiring additional energy from the grid even under low RES power availability conditions. Two methods that differ as a function of the EV power flow direction are proposed. The first SC only involves unidirectional power flow, while the second one also considers bidirectional power flow among vehicles, operating in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) mode. Finally, simulations, which are presented considering an actual case study, validate the SC effects on a reference scenario consisting of an industrial area having a photovoltaic (PV) plant, non-modulable electrical loads, and EV charging stations (CS). Results are collected and performance improvements by operating the different SC methods are compared and described in detail in this paper. © Copyright © 2021 Lo Franco, Mandrioli, Ricco, Monteiro, Monteiro, Afonso and Grandi.",10.3389/fenrg.2021.716389,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3389/fenrg.2021.716389,14,high
maybe,,Adapted Stochastic PV Hosting Capacity Approach for Electric Vehicle Charging Considering Undervoltage,"This paper presents a stochastic approach to single-phase and three-phase EV charge hosting capacity for distribution networks. The method includes the two types of uncertainties, aleatory and epistemic, and is developed from an equivalent method that was applied to solar PV hosting capacity estimation. The method is applied to two existing low-voltage networks in Northern Sweden, with six and 83 customers. The lowest background voltage and highest consumption per customer are obtained from measurements. It is shown that both have a big impact on the hosting capacity. The hosting capacity also depends strongly on the charging size, within the range of charging size expected in the near future. The large range in hosting capacity found from this study-between 0\% and 100\% of customers can simultaneously charge their EV car-means that such hosting capacity studies are needed for each individual distribution network.

The use of EVs has been promoted through the development of inclusive strategies for electromobility in the recent years. Apart from actions directed and funded by the European Union, national strategies have also been employed to support electromobility. Such a strategic plan has already been enacted by the Hellenic Ministry of Environment and Energy, funding municipalities to prepare siting and sizing plans for electric vehicle chargers. In this paper, the final study of this strategic plan for the municipality of Heraklion in Crete is used as a case study to investigate the effect of EV chargers on the operation of the Cretan power system. Their selected siting points are evaluated by performing a power flow analysis at the level of 150 kV. Thus, they are aggregated in each 20 kV/150 kV distribution substation of the electrical grid with the aim of investigating their effect on substation loading and transmission line losses. Generally, extensive fast charging should be avoided to minimize the risk of sudden stress of the existing cities’ grids and control strategies should be implemented to mitigate the need for upscale substation equipment or even postpone reinforcements. © 2021 by the authors.

As additional equipment like electric vehicles, heat pumps or solar power systems can sometimes cause unbalanced power flows, existing algorithms have to be adapted. In comparison to algorithms considering balanced power flows, the presented algorithm uses a complete model of a three-phase four-wire low voltage grid. Additionally, a constraint for the voltage unbalance in the grid is introduced. The algorithm can be used to optimize the operation of energy storage systems in unbalanced systems. The used grid model, constraints, objective function and solver are explained in detail. A validation of the algorithm using a commercial tool is done.

maybe,,100 kw three-phase wireless charger for ev: Experimental validation adopting opposition method,"This paper presents the experimental validation, using the opposition method, of a high-power three-phase Wireless-Power-Transfer (WPT) system for automotive applications. The system under test consists of three coils with circular sector shape overlapped to minimize the mutual cross-coupling, a three-phase inverter at primary side and a three-phase rectifier at receiver side. In fact thanks to the delta configuration used to connect the coils of the electromagnetic structure, a three-phase Silicon Carbide (SiC) inverter is driving the transmitter side. The resonance tank capacitors are placed outside of the delta configuration reducing in this way their voltage sizing. This WPT system is used as a 100 kW–85 kHz ultrafast battery charger for light delivery vehicle directly supplied by the power grid of tramways. The adopted test-bench for the WPT charger consists of adding circulating boost converter to the system under test to perform the opposition method technique. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed structure together with the validation of fully exploited simulation analysis. This is demonstrated by transferring 100 kW with more than 94% DC-to-DC efficiency over 50 mm air gap in aligned conditions.

maybe,,Towards renewable-dominated power systems considering long-term uncertainties: Case study of las palmas,"In this paper, we analyze the generation, storage and transmission expansion of the isolated power system of Las Palmas (Spain) for 2050. This power system comprises two isolated systems: Lanzarote-Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria. The generating, storage and transmission capacity to be built is determined by solving a two-stage stochastic investment model taking into account different long-term uncertain parameters: investment costs of immature technologies of power production and storage, annual demand growth, number of electric vehicles, rooftop solar penetration and natural gas prices. The possibility of linking together the isolated power systems of Lanzarote-Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria for reaching a higher penetration of renewable units is also considered. The operation of the power system is simulated by considering the day-ahead energy and reserve capacity markets. The variability of the hourly available wind and solar power, and the demand level are modeled by using a set of characteristic days to represent the target year. The performance of the resulting power system is assessed by conducting an out-of-sample analysis using the AC model of the power system. The numerical results show that a future configuration of Las Palmas power system mainly based on solar and wind power units can be achieved with the support of gas units and storage. © 2021 by the authors.

maybe,,Metaheuristics and transmission expansion planning: A comparative case study,"Transmission expansion planning (TEP), the determination of new transmission lines to be added to an existing power network, is a key element in power system planning. Using classical optimization to define the most suitable reinforcements is the most desirable alternative. However, the extent of the under‐study problems is growing, because of the uncertainties introduced by renewable generation or electric vehicles (EVs) and the larger sizes under consideration given the trends for higher renewable shares and stronger market integration. This means that classical optimization, even using efficient techniques, such as stochastic decomposition, can have issues when solving large‐sized problems. This is compounded by the fact that, in many cases, it is necessary to solve a large number of instances of a problem in order to incorporate further considerations. Thus, it can be interesting to resort to metaheuristics, which can offer quick solutions at the expense of an optimality guarantee. Metaheuristics can even be combined with classical optimization to try to extract the best of both worlds. There is a vast literature that tests individual metaheuristics on specific case studies, but wide comparisons are missing. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA), orthogonal crossover based differential evolution (OXDE), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), moth–flame optimization (MFO), exchange market algorithm (EMA), sine cosine algorithm (SCA) optimization and imperialistic competitive algorithm (ICA) are tested and compared. The algorithms are applied to the standard test systems of IEEE 24, and 118 buses.

maybe,,Sizing procedure for system hybridization based on experimental source modeling for electric vehicles,"Hybrid vehicles are now more common in response to increasing global warming. The hybridization of energy sources and energy storage units enables improving the sustainability, reliability, and robustness of power systems. To reach the objective of zero emissions, a proton exchange membrane hydrogen fuel‐cell was utilized as an energy source. The aim of this research was to create an accurate optimal sizing procedure for determining the nominal rating of the necessary sources. We modeled the fuel cell and the battery pack using data from real experimental results to create the generic database. Then, we added data on the mission profile, system constraints, and the minimization target function. The mission profile was then analyzed by the sizing algorithm to determine optional minimum and maximum fuel cell ratings. Analyzing the optional solutions using the vehicle real time energy management system controller resulted in a set of solutions for each available rated fuel cell, and the optimal compatible battery in the revealed band successfully accomplished the route of the driving cycle within the system limitations. Finally, the Pareto curve represented the optimal finding of the sizing procedure. Ultimately, in contrast to previous works that utilize gross manufacturer data in the sizing procedure, the main research contribution and novelty of this research is the very accurate sizing results, which draw on real experimental‐based fuel‐cell and battery sizing models. Moreover, the actual vehicle real time energy management system controllers were used in the sizing procedure. © 2021 by the authors.

maybe,,Sizing and energy management of parking lots of electric vehicles based on battery storage with wind resources in distribution network,"In this paper, an optimal sizing and placement framework (OSPF) is performed for electric parking lots integrated with wind turbines in a 33-bus distribution network. The total objective function is defined as minimizing the total cost including the cost of grid power, cost of power losses, cost of charge and discharge of parking lots, cost of wind turbines as well as voltage deviations reduction. In the OSPF, optimization variables are selected as electric parking size and wind turbines, which have been determined optimally using an intelligent method named arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) inspired by arithmetic operators in mathematics. The load following strategy (LFS) is used for energy management in the OSPF. The OSPF is evaluated in three cases of the objective function such as minimizing the cost of power losses, minimizing the network voltage deviations, and minimizing the total objective function using the AOA. The capability of the AOA is compared with the well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms for solving the OSPF in the last case. The findings show that the power loss, voltage deviations, and power purchased from the grid are reduced considerably based on the OSPF using the AOA. The results show the lowest total cost of energy and also minimum network voltage deviation (third case) by the AOA in comparison with the PSO and ABC with a higher convergence rate, which confirms the better capability of the proposed method. The results of the first and second cases show the high cost of power purchased from the main grid as well as the high total cost. Therefore, the comparison of different cases confirms that considering the cost index along with losses and voltage deviations causes a compromise between different objectives, and thus the cost of purchasing power from the main network is significantly reduced. Moreover, the voltage profile of the network improves, and also the minimum voltage of the network is also enhanced using the OSPF via the AOA. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we aim at showing these uncertainties and assess different levers to enable the integration of e-Mobility. Therefore, we introduce an Agent-based model assessing regional charging demand and infrastructure networks with the interactions between charging infrastructure and electric vehicles. A global sensitivity analysis is applied to derive general guidelines for integrating e-Mobility effectively within a region by considering the grid impact, the economic viability and the Service Quality of the deployed Charging Infrastructure (SQCI). We show that an improved macro-economic framework should enable infrastructure investments across different types of locations such as public, highway and work to utilize cross-locational charging peak reduction effects.

maybe,,Travel activity based stochastic modelling of load and charging state of electric vehicles,"The uptake of electric vehicles (EV) is increasing every year and will eventually replace the traditional transport system in the near future. This imminent increase is urging stakeholders to plan up-gradation in the electric power system infrastructure. However, for efficient planning to support an additional load, an accurate assessment of the electric vehicle load and power quality indices is required. Although several EV models to estimate the charging profile and additional electrical load are available, but they are not capable of providing a high-resolution evaluation of charging current, especially at a higher frequency. This paper presents a probabilistic approach capable of estimating the time-dependent charging and harmonic currents for the future EV load.

maybe,,Active and reactive power collaborative optimization for active distribution networks considering bi‐directional v2g behavior,"Due to their great potential for energy conservation and emission reduction, electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted the attention of governments around the world and become more popular. However, the high penetration rate of EVs has brought great challenges to the operation of the Active Distribution Network (ADN). On the other hand, EVs will be equipped with more intelligent chargers in the future, which supports the EVs’ high flexibility in both active and reactive power control. In this paper, a distributed optimization model of ADN is proposed by employing the collaborative active and reactive power control capability of EVs. Firstly, the preference of EV users is taken into account and the charging mode of EVs is divided into three categories: rated power charging, non‐discharging, and flexible charging–discharging. Then, the reactive power compensation capacity of the plugged‐in EV is deduced based on the circuit topology of the intelligent charger and the active–reactive power control model of the EV is established subsequently. Secondly, considering the operation constraints of ADN and the charging–discharging constraints of EVs over the operation planning horizon, the optimization objective of the model is proposed, which consists of two parts: “minimizing energy cost” and “improving voltage profile”. Finally, a distributed solution method is proposed based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The proposed model is implemented on a 33‐bus ADN. The obtained results demonstrate that it is beneficial to achieve lower energy cost and increase the voltage profile of the ADN.

maybe,,Integrating electric vehicles into power system operation production cost models,"The electrification of the transportation sector will increase the demand for electric power, potentially impacting the peak load and power system operations. A change such as this will be multifaceted. A power system production cost model (PCM) is a useful tool with which to analyze one of these facets, the operation of the power system. A PCM is a computer simulation that mimics power system operation, i.e., unit commitment, economic dispatch, reserves, etc. To understand how electric vehicles (EVs) will affect power system operation, it is necessary to create models that describe how EVs interact with power system operations that are suitable for use in a PCM. In this work, EV charging data from the EV Project, reported by the Idaho National Laboratory, were used to create scalable, statistical models of EV charging load profiles suitable for incorporation into a PCM. Models of EV loads were created for uncoordinated and coordinated charging. Uncoordinated charging load represents the load resulting from EV owners that charge at times of their choosing. To create an uncoordinated charging load profile, the parameters of importance are the number of vehicles, charger type, battery capacity, availability for charging, and battery beginning and ending states of charge. Coordinated charging is where EVs are charged via an “aggregator” that interacts with a power system operator to schedule EV charging at times that either minimize system operating costs, decrease EV charging costs, or both, while meeting the daily EV charging requirements subject to the EV owners’ charging constraints. Beta distributions were found to be the most appropriate distribution for statistically modeling the initial and final state of charge (SoC) of vehicles in an EV fleet. A Monte Carlo technique was implemented by sampling the charging parameters of importance to create an uncoordinated charging load time series. Coordinated charging was modeled as a controllable load within the PCM to represent the influence of the EV fleet on the system’s electricity price. The charging models were integrated as EV loads in a simple 5-bus system to demonstrate their usefulness. Polaris Systems Optimization’s PCM power system optimizer (PSO) was employed to show the effect of the EVs on one day of operation in the 5-bus power system, yielding interesting and valid results and showing the effectiveness of the charging models. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to imperfect data about the availability of electric vehicles, the uncertainty of the demand-side increases considerably. To overcome the problem, the power storage capacity of electric vehicles is addressed to provide demand flexibility for the supply-side. This paper proposes a novel structure for parking lot microgrids to provide day-ahead peak-shaving and valley-filling for power systems with distinct peak hours in the daily operation.

The microgrid is supplied by the wholesale electricity market and bilateral contracts. To leverage the flexibility potentials of electric vehicles, a data-driven approach is suggested that classifies the electric vehicles based on distinct characteristics, e.g. dwell time and preferred state of charge.

In this study, a comprehensive electricity generation analysis based on an hourly time-step is done in a bid to solve to electrification crisis in developing countries. This study aims to present the feasible pathways with which sustainable electrification can be achieved. This is done by considering the financial feasibility, environmental sustainability, and technical viability of different technological combinations. In comparison to existing literature, this study is novel as the integration of both renewable energy sources and a fossil fuel source is analyzed. With Nigeria being the study area, the integration of five renewable energy-based technologies namely; offshore wind power plant, onshore wind power plant, solar photovoltaic system, concentrated solar power plant, and hydropower plant as well as pumped hydro storage system is considered within the scope of this study. Based on the results of the analysis, out of the ninety-nine different combinatory scenarios modeled, the most viable solution with the use of renewables and natural gas is the combination of natural gas power plants, on-shore wind power plants, and solar photovoltaic systems. This requires a large capacity installation (32,500 MW of natural gas power plant, 12,000 MW of solar photovoltaic plant, and 7000 MW of on-shore wind power plant) as well as a total annual cost and an investment cost of $ 22B and $ 48.7B. Furthermore, solving the poised problem based on renewable energy technologies will only require the combination of on-shore wind power plants, hydropower plants, solar photovoltaic system, and pumped hydro storage system. The integration of plug-in battery electric vehicles and hydrogen production will help maximize the electricity produced from the renewable energy-based power systems. This will also reduce the overall carbon emission from the country at large.

Optimal planning avails itself of the exploitation manner of existing energy resources alongside appropriate employment of demand response (DR) programs and available electric vehicles (EV) in parking lots of immense industrial centers as storage sites in energy management systems in industrial smart grids have been seriously considered. This article introduces a new perspective in the simultaneous use of demand response loads and available electric vehicles in parking lots toward energy management of industrial virtual power plants (IVPPs) aiming at augmenting the system's profits as well as increasing the grid reliability under peak load conditions and cutting down on industrial centers load shedding. The objective function of the problem is formulated within the framework of short-term production planning for distributed energy resources (DER) and conventional ones in conjunction with DR programs and EV in such a way that the IVPPs' profits are maximized. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we have applied and tried on the second zone of IEEE-RTS standard grid. The outcomes accrued from various simulations point to the fact that the presence of EV within the boundaries of EV's parking lots prompts considerable increase in IVPPs' storage amount and consequent decline in exploiting full power grid capacity. Utilizing DR programs for responding load and selecting best scheduling schemes for each IVPP during various times of a day-night cycles will bring about a reduction in operation costs, de-peaking as well as an enhanced performance of EV's parking installations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.102951,2021,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.102951,14,high

maybe,,Optimal Design of Electric Vehicle Parking Lot based on Energy Management Considering Hydrogen Storage System and Demand Side Management,"Basically, a system is associated with uncertainty and it is the existence of such a factor which results in an uncertain planning and designing. In today's power system, these conditions are mostly reasoned through the uncertain performance of a number of parameters e.g. price, so the use of uncertainty modeling becomes necessary. In the present work, an optimization model, based on virus search colony, is used for the optimal performance of intelligent parking of electric vehicles in uncertainty situations caused by the price of the upstream grid in the demand response (DRP) program. It has been used to reduce the daily cost of performance by changing various parts of the load between peak and off-peak intervals. Virus Colony Search (VCS) method is a method based on the random-based population, which is also based on specific behaviors of the virus. Chaos theory has been used to develop this algorithm and improve local and global search. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective algorithm is a model based on non-dominated sorting model, variable detection, memory-based strategy selection and fuzzy theory to select the best Pareto from the answer set. Besides, it has a powerful function in solving the above problem. Regarding the mentioned techniques, the possibility of being in local points is reduced and the speed of convergence to the final response is increased. The proposed method was investigated on a sample system including, intelligent parking, local units, thermal and renewable plants in the proposed upstream grid price uncertainty technique.

We apply the model to a case study assuming European power sector decarbonization towards 2060 according to a 1.5 degree scenario, and we investigate the impact of coupling building heat systems and electric vehicle charging in Norway with the European power market. The case study focuses on the role of Norway in a European perspective because: (1) Norwegian electricity production is mainly based on flexible and renewable hydropower, (2) Norwegian building heating systems are currently mainly electric, and (3) Norway is already introducing electric vehicles at large. We focus on the European power market to test our hypothesis that it is more cost-efficient to decarbonize when the central power system is coordinated with building heat systems and electric vehicle charging. For Europe as a whole, results show that the average European electricity cost reduces by 3% and transmission expansion decreases by 0.4% when Norwegian heat systems are developed in coordination with the European power system. The average Norwegian electricity cost decreases by 19%.

Recently, some studies found electric vehicles that receive fast-charging service may also bring much air pollution due to fossil-fuel fired power generation. Hence, depending on the power generation mix, electric vehicles may have adverse environmental impacts. The current studies of fast-charging station planning only focus on power system planning and often ignore other parts of the transportation system such as internal combustion engine vehicles and gasoline stations. Moreover, most the current studies lack a comprehensive planning strategy for the fast-charging station that involves elements above simultaneously. In this context, an interdisciplinary study is implemented on the coordinated planning strategy of the fast-charging station in coupled transportation and power distribution systems. The proposed strategy with a multiple objective integer model can measure the impact of air pollutions from electric vehicles on air quality and human health in different areas. Considering the traffic flow assignment, the driving range logic constraints are used. The branch flow model is applied to power distribution systems. To measure the impacts of air pollutions on air quality and human health, the air pollution from the Road traffic model, the Gaussian Plum Model and the C-R function are adopted. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the proposed strategy and the mathematical model. The fast-charging station location and size can be determined by the mathematical model.

These challenges are further amplified in the case of a highly urbanised and densely populated small island state, like Singapore, with limited space and options for electricity sector planning. In response, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of a large-scale EV deployment on the electricity sector from a whole-system perspective with focus on investments in the power sector for EV adoption, assuming minimum deployment of advanced “smart-grid” and “vehicle-to-grid” technologies. Findings suggest that a small-scale deployment of EVs below 20% replacement can be economically manageable. A large-scale of deployment of EVs would inevitably bring a notable impact to the electricity sector regardless the state of advanced technology development.

This requires selecting the most appropriate conductors, transformers, and voltage regulation devices, which becomes a complex combinatorial problem. This paper proposes a bi-period three-phase AC Optimal Power Flow methodology to minimize asset costs while capturing the time-dependent impacts of EVs, PVs, and the locational effects on the transformer's primary voltage. The proposed approach is demonstrated using two realistic residential Australian LV networks: one having a single circuit with 31 houses, and another having multiple circuits with 89 houses. The approach identified optimal designs for both networks that minimize costs addressing the technical challenges. For single-circuit networks, off-load tap changers with thicker conductors is the most cost-effective design for both close and distant locations (relative to the primary substation). However, in multi-circuit networks, particularly in distant locations with significant voltage variations, on-load tap changers with thinner conductors is the most cost-effective design. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual network characteristics to optimally design brand-new LV networks with EVs and PVs. © 2025 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.epsr.2025.112109,2026,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2025.112109,13,high

Thus, an improved approach called MCWOA (modified chaotic whale optimization algorithm) is proposed for optimal sizing of HRES by incorporating the Lévy Flight strategy into the chaotic whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The results obtained are compared with other standard optimization algorithms, like WOA, Chaotic WOA (CWOA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which indicate that MCWOA outperforms all the above-mentioned algorithms in terms of Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and reliability index, i.e., Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP). The LCOE of proposed HRES using MCWOA is found to be 1.1 %, 1.4 %, and 4.3 % lower compared to the obtained values using PSO, CWOA, and WOA, respectively. Similarly, the LPSP is 1.1 %, 1.8 % and 2.4 % lower compared to the obtained values using PSO, CWOA, and WOA, respectively.

As General Motors partners with electric utilities to design and implement these programs, it is important to understand customers’ preferences and motivations for enrollment. A discrete choice experiment was conducted to quantify how customers trade off among program characteristics and incentives when deciding whether to enroll in demand response, managed charging, and fixed schedule programs. The data were used to estimate two hybrid choice models, which outperform a benchmark conditional logit model and systematically account for unobserved preference heterogeneity using discrete–continuous mixtures. The results indicate that monetary incentives and environmental benefits increase the likelihood of choosing a smart charging program. Meanwhile, there is notable preference heterogeneity regarding non-monetary program options and enrollment perks. Latent environmental concern was constructed as a useful dimension for differentiating customers: those with higher environmental concern tend to exhibit higher valuations of reducing emissions and maximizing renewable energy use. We further linked preferences to five personas based on sociodemographic clustering.

In the context of extensive penetration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into the distribution system, this study investigates the potential of EVs as an auxiliary power source for post-disaster power supply restoration using actual data from Shanghai. A coupling system comprising the traffic network and the urban distribution system was established, where the travel and charging patterns of EVs were modeled using actual data. Based on that, the spatio-temporal available EV power at different Vehicle to Grid (V2G) stations can be estimated after calculating EVs’ on-road power consumption and considering the V2G response policy. A post-disaster power supply restoration scheme that incorporates V2G participation was proposed, leading to a better restoration strategy that fully utilizes V2G capabilities. It can be found that V2G based restoration scheme demonstrates superior performance in enhancing grid resilience during disaster scenarios, as quantified by various resilience indicators including power loss, response speed, and recovery degree. Additionally, the model offers spatio-temporal insights for disaster prevention by leveraging V2G technology, identifying critical times and locations for effective defense during disasters.

In this study, we analyze the following question: How will prosumaging households, who consume, produce and manage their energy consumption with HEMS, impact the future reinforcement costs of the electricity distribution grid? We conducted case studies for two urban areas, Murcia in Spain and Leeuwarden in The Netherlands. First, by developing scenarios on the uptake of electrified heating systems, PV installations, battery storage, EVs and HEMSs, the energy demand of each building is modeled for the two areas under different scenarios.

To cope with the operational problems of IMGs in the presence of PEVs, this paper proposes a comprehensive market-based energy management system (EMS), called micro-market (μM), incorporating different participants and PEVs traffic flow. The proposed model considers both vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) modes with different traffic behavior of parking lots (PLs) and charging stations (CSs) in an IMG market environment (including uniform electricity pricing and unit commitment). Establishing a bidirectional linearized AC (BLAC) power flow enables the μM to efficiently schedule the joint active-reactive power of all participants and provide local energy trading conditions. Moreover, the developed μM schedules the cost of joint up/downward active-reactive reserve power effectively, ensuring the IMG will be operated securely. The suggested model is a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming (MILP), with the objective of maximizing social welfare (SW) for the upcoming day. The introduced model's efficacy is assessed by testing the μM in an IMG on the CIGRE medium-voltage benchmark, considering three different operational cases. The results reveal that incorporating PEVs traffic flow into the μM model increases SW by 3.7 %. However, adding battery degradation costs, while causing a 3 % reduction in the objective function, significantly enhances the model's practicality by meeting IMGs real-world operational requirements. Overall, the results verified the ability of the proposed model to address different operational challenges while the PEV owners' preferences are satisfied and secure operation is ensured. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125652,2025,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125652,13,high

To highlight its advantages, extensive studies have been conducted on the techno-economic and environmental impacts of integrating RESs and ESSs into EVCSs. However, important aspects such as load management capabilities and the operational efficiency of these systems in EVCSs have received comparatively little attention. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the load management and operational efficiency of combining RESs and ESSs with ultra-fast direct current chargers (UFCs) in an EVCS. It conducts a hypothetical case study on a commercial Evie network (charging company) charging station having 4 ultra-fast charging ports, in Australia, to investigate three load management strategies: 1) user-preferred, 2) grid-preferred, and 3) renewable energy resources - battery energy storage integrated systems (ReBIS). The study investigates the load management and operational effectiveness of these strategies in combination with techno-economic analysis. It highlights that the ReBIS effectively reduces grid peak demand, maximizes charging sessions, alleviates grid strains, and balances both user and grid charging preferences. Simulation results indicate that ReBIS with UFCs lowers energy costs by 40 %, supports 99.4 % of user-preferred charging sessions, and cuts carbon emissions by 63.2 % and 65.2 % compared to user-preferred and grid-preferred modes, respectively.

maybe,,"Aggregator-driven optimisation of electric vehicle charging stations in Shenzhen: Synergising smart charging, renewable energy integration and energy storage","The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) presents substantial challenges such as increased peak loads, accelerated power infrastructure degradation and reduced economic efficiency. To address these issues, this study proposes an integrated multi-technology charging station model alongside an innovative analytical framework for assessing the comprehensive benefits of charging aggregators. The framework integrated a randomised load forecasting model with a smart charging strategy and was validated using real-world data obtained from 1682 charging stations, comprising 24,798 individual charging piles, in Shenzhen, China. Implementing the proposed charging station model, combined with Shenzhen's time-of-use tariff structure and an >80 % renewable energy penetration rate, reduced levelised cost of energy, carbon emissions and peak load by 0.38 Yuan per kWh. Furthermore, renewable energy contributes to a 44.01 % reduction in carbon emissions in the smart charging system, outperforming the 41.24 % reduction observed in the on-demand charging system. Additionally, smart charging and on-demand charging methods reduce peak loads by 30.03 % and 15.40 %, respectively. It is found that combining energy storage with smart charging effectively mitigates their negative effects on emissions and costs. Energy storage increased annual carbon emissions (from 1.402 Mt. to 1.688 Mt) in an on-demand charging scenario, whereas it decreased them in a smart charging scenario. Although the current uneven distribution and low utilisation rate of EV charging resources in Shenzhen have resulted in financial losses for charging aggregators, the anticipated rapid growth in charging demand and improved utilisation rates are expected to substantially enhance profitability.

The power demand for charging PEVs is growing in a random manner. This has increased the concern of the grid for meeting the demand in real-time. A novel tri-level demand and pricing management strategy is proposed in the study to address this issue. The proposed strategy participates in the day-ahead market and real time market to purchase power from the grid. A long short-term memory network is used to estimate the PEV demand. Weather forecasting is used to estimate the renewable generation. The strategy analyzes the demand-supply and their economics to generate the real-time power price for PEV operations. Deep reinforcement learning is employed to coordinate the PEV operations in real-time.

maybe,,Hierarchical energy profile characterization of electric vehicle charging stations integrated with photovoltaic systems based on clustering techniques,"Secondary and primary substations of networks with electric vehicle (EV) chargers and photovoltaics (PVs) experience net loads characterized by uncertainty. Accurate characterization of EV, PV and net load energy profiles is necessary to plan new installations and to develop forecasting methodologies. This paper provides a novel contribution to the energy profile characterization of EVs and PVs, exploiting clustering techniques in a hierarchical framework to eventually characterize the overall net load profiles. In the proposal, the lower levels of the hierarchy identify clusters of EV load and PV generation profiles at individual installations, alternatively using one clustering technique among DBSCAN, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), K-means algorithm (KMA), and spectral clustering (SC). The intermediate levels of the hierarchy reconstruct the overall EV load and PV generation profiles through a proposed frequentist combination of the lower-level profiles. The upper level of the hierarchy characterizes the overall net load through a novel approach based on the quantile convolution of the intermediate-level EV and PV profiles. Real EV load and PV generation data are used to evaluate the performance of the presented hierarchical methodology, with relative fitting improvements between 1\% and 8\% (compared to a two-level hierarchical benchmark) and between 16\% and 29\% (compared to a direct, non-hierarchical benchmark).",10.1049/rpg2.70006,2025,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1049/rpg2.70006,13,high

maybe,,Adaptive Real-Time Degradation Modeling for Lithium-Ion Batteries in Grid Energy Storage Systems,"The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into smart grids has intensified the demand for efficient and reliable energy storage systems (ESSs). Predicting LIB degradation in real time remains a critical challenge, directly affecting the economics and reliability of grid-scale applications. Existing degradation models typically depend on costly and time-consuming laboratory-based cycling tests, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Real-Time Degradation Model (ARDM) that addresses these limitations by eliminating the need for experimental pre-cycling and instead relying solely on real-time operational data and manufacturer datasheet parameters. The ARDM uniquely and continuously adapts its modeling parameters during live operation, accounting for key stress factors such as depth of discharge, charge/discharge rates, and temperature. Unlike traditional static models, the ARDM is chemistry-agnostic, requiring no prior calibration and achieving degradation prediction errors of less than 0.0005%, representing a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental validation on two commercial LIBs under diverse stress conditions confirms the model’s accuracy, adaptability, and robustness. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that ARDM not only outperforms benchmark models but also offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for degradation-aware energy management in grid and electric vehicle applications.

However, most existing solutions focus mainly on privacy preservation, efficiency, and bidding strategies, while overlooking the critical issue of key parameters distribution—particularly in day-ahead electricity auctions. At the start of an auction, it is essential to distribute key parameters to all participants in a timely, synchronized, and efficient manner. To address the challenges of fairness, collusion resistance, and efficiency in the predistribution of key parameters, we propose an efficient and collusion-resistant key parameters predistribution system (ECR-KPPDS) for day-ahead electricity auctions. As a core component, we design a novel cryptographic primitive, termed identity-based timed-release proxy re-encryption (IBTRPRE). Based on the truncated $q$ -augmented bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent ( $q$ -ABDHE) hardness assumption, we instantiate two concrete schemes tailored to different security requirements.

maybe,,Stability Analysis and Control Validation of DDEV in Handling Limit via SOSP: A Strategy Based on Stability Region,"The stability region is an important criterion in the active safety system of vehicle. Extensive literatures have developed various stability regions for the centralized driving vehicle (CDV). However, seldom of them make a thorough analysis of the stability for distributed driving electric vehicle (DDEV). Especially when the direct yaw moment control (DYC) intervenes, the stability region of DDEV shows a huge difference compared with CDV. So far, most researches on the stability control of DDEV are still based on the traditional CDV stability region, which leads to the conservation of controller design. To this end, a dynamic and analytical stability region of DDEV is firstly developed in this paper. By employing sum of square programming (SOSP) algorithm, we choose a high-order Lyapunov function to make a precise estimation of the stability region. A novel DC shape function is proposed to reduce the conservation of estimation when DYC involves. To ensure the real-time performance for control application, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed to fit the coefficients of Lyapunov function, as well as enable the dynamic shifting with driving conditions. Based on the aforementioned stability region, we develop a MPC controller to ensure the stability and tracking performance during handling limit. Both simulations and road tests demonstrate that the developed stability region could effectively restraint the vehicle states from diverging, which enhances vehicle maneuverability while ensuring vehicle stability. Note to Practitioners—Handling stability is a crucial factor which concerns the safety of vehicle. Almost all vehicles should be equipped with active safety system, such as Electronic Stability Program (ESP) of Bosch and Electronic Stability Controller (ESC) of GM. They collect the real-time vehicle states by the Built-in sensors. Meanwhile, they calculate the current stability margin according to the driver’s control input and analyze the deviation of the vehicle states to decide whether the active control is needed to maintain the stability of vehicle. This system is established well in CDV. However, for DDEV, it has another input of DYC in addition to wheel steering angle, which changes the dynamic characteristic of vehicle. This means that the stability margin of traditional ESP is inaccurate when the DYC intervenes, which will lead to the misjudgment of instability or the unsafety of vehicle. This paper develops an analytic stability region of DDEV and describes the stability margin with different values of DYC, which could adapt to varying conditions. This technology fills the gap of the stability determination of DDEV and has a good application prospect in the active safety system of DDEV.",10.1109/TASE.2023.3333393,2025,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tase.2023.3333393,13,high

maybe,,Learning-Accelerated Distributed Economic Dispatch in Vehicle-to-Grid Integrated Microgrids,"Next-generation smart grids require decentralized optimization frameworks to coordinate diverse energy assets, including renewables, dispatchable generators, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled electric vehicles (EVs). A critical challenge lies in reducing the overall communication overhead and computational burden for distributed economic dispatch through learning-accelerated optimization, while addressing uncertainties in EV charging patterns, time-varying communication networks, and battery longevity constraints. This paper proposes a learning-accelerated distributed optimization framework for V2G-integrated microgrids. A novel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enhanced by deep neural networks, termed learning-accelerated ADMM (LA-ADMM), is developed to predict optimal dual variables, with theoretical convergence under dynamic network conditions rigorously proved. For handling EV uncertainties, the framework incorporates model predictive control (MPC) architecture with dispatch package strategies that minimize computational overhead through adaptive reuse of historical solutions during steady-state operations. Battery lifespan preservation is achieved through tight coupling of operational constraints with a universal constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging protocol.

In the first stage, based on a novel energy structure of URT-MG with EVCS, a coordinated control strategy of the integrated system is achieved, which can reduce the substation peak power. Then, the minimal operation cost of urban rail transit (URT) substation is obtained by a day-ahead energy management considering the forecast data of RES and different discharging capacities of EVCS. As for the second stage, the deviation between actual operation and referral dispatch plan from the first stage is eliminated by the model predictive control (MPC) method considering the uncertainties. In the third stage, an adaptive charging strategy of individual electric vehicles (EVs) is designed. This strategy can dynamically adjust the charging power of each EV to meet the travel demand of EV customers. The simulation based on the Merseyrail line of Liverpool is conducted, which verifies the validity of the proposed strategy.

We propose an agile decision support system (DSS) to mitigate these impacts by harnessing electric vehicles (EVs) as mobile energy sources serving the multiple microgrids ($\mu$Gs) formed within affected communities. Given that not all $\mu$Gs possess adequate energy storage and distributed energy resources (DERs), we advocate for the mobilization of vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled EVs for equitable and resilient energy access. Our emergency service relocation (ESR) model incentivizes EV owners to transport stored energy between $\mu$Gs. However, traditional DSS cannot promptly solve the associated mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, necessitating a faster solution algorithm for rapid EV deployment under emergency conditions.

However, previous studies have not addressed the connection between BSS recharging strategies and the demand for fully charged batteries, which is determined by EV swapping schemes. To address this gap, the paper proposes a joint optimization approach for scheduling EVs and managing BSSs, considering RE generation along the highway. Specifically, a spatial-temporal network model is developed to represent the transportation-energy characteristics of EVs, incorporating BSS selection and battery swapping processes. Additionally, a BSS management model is formulated to plan the recharging of depleted batteries and ensure the availability of fully charged batteries to meet the swapping demands of EVs. The Lagrange relaxation algorithm is employed to handle the interaction between EV scheduling and BSS operations.

This paper proposes a two-stage data-driven holistic optimization model for the siting and capacity allocation of charging stations. In the first stage, the location and number of charging piles are determined by analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of charging demand using ST-DBSCAN and K-means clustering methods. In the second stage, charging load results from the first stage, photovoltaic generation forecast, and electricity price are jointly considered to minimize the operator’s total cost determined by the capacity of PV and ESS, which is solved by the genetic algorithm. To validate the model, we leverage large-scale GPS trajectory data from electric taxis in Shenzhen as a data-driven source of spatiotemporal charging demand. The research results indicate that the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of different charging demands determine whether a charging station can become a PSCS and the optimal capacity of PV and battery within the station, rather than a fixed configuration.

The electrical model used in this study features one RC-branch in a switched ECM configuration to adapt to different dynamics during charging and discharging and incorporates a snubber circuit to mitigate current spikes.

The NN estimates critical parameters, such as resistances and capacitors, in a physically interpretable space, ensuring that the model remains closely aligned with real-world components. The parameters of the ECM have been previously estimated by using an optimization procedure on real dataset, and the obtained values have been used as benchmark for the hybrid methodology. Simulation tests have been performed by varying the learning size and the batch size of the ENN.

maybe,,Optimal expansion planning of electric vehicle fast charging stations,"With the penetration rate of electric vehicles (EVs) increasing exponentially, the high charging load may cause new issues in future power system, e.g., voltage drop. Besides, EV Charging stations (EVCSs) located in inadequate places exacerbate these issues, causing charging demand to concentrate on a few EVCSs. Therefore, the charging demand estimation for EVCSs and their strategic placement is essential for the system operators and charging station owner. The paper proposes a method for optimal EVCS placement to achieve charging demand dispersion considering not only installation cost but also drivers’ preferences and existing charging stations. To optimally place EVCSs, this work first estimates the charging demand of existing EVCSs based on kernel density estimation. The charging demand for new and existing EVCSs is modeled using the nearest neighbor search to consider drivers’ preference for the nearer station. Next, the EVCS placement problem is formulated to minimize the peak charging demand using integer nonlinear programming, a non-convex problem. To tackle this non-convex problem, a minimax genetic algorithm is proposed, which is genetic algorithm combined with game theory. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulations based on real data from Jeju Island. After applying the proposed method, new EVCS placement is determined by analyzing the tradeoff between the degree of charging demand dispersion and installation cost.

There have been considerable difficulties in analyzing the adoption of all types of EV infrastructure due to the lack of publicly available individual EV user data across various service providers, such as distribution network operators, EV aggregators, EV users, utilities, regulators, and academics. In this study, we introduce the JETPANN (Joint EV energy consumption and charging duration Training Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks), a novel jointly trainable artificial deep neural network framework for predicting stochastic EV user behavior by predicting their stay/charging duration and energy consumption simultaneously. We used a large-scale dataset of individual EV users’ charging transactions collected at a multi-site UCLA campus, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the Port of LA, the City of Santa Monica, and the City of Pasadena over a five-year period. This includes more than 50 EVSEs (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) and 216 EV charging points. Over 50,000 real-time transactions were recorded in our database with 341 distinct EV users. In this research, essential attributes of each charging session were identified, extracted from our database, and then fed into our JETPANN network. Using a jointly trained framework, our AI-enabled network predicts the stay/charging duration and the energy consumption of all the recorded EV users with an accuracy of above 99 percent. The proposed technique was tested and validated using all the collected historical charging data from individual EV users via realizing mean-absolute errors of training loss versus validation loss. Utilizing hyperparameter tuning and semi-grid search, the JETPANN with semi-optimized hyperparameters was achieved with the lowest mean-absolute errors of 0.927 and 0.068 in predicting stay/charging durations and energy consumptions, respectively, in a jointly trainable framework.

maybe,,Optimal allocation of FCSs and PV units in smart grids considering traffic and generation dispatch,"Worldwide, transportation electrification and photovoltaics (PVs) have become vital components of modern and future planning problems. Therefore, the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) requires reliable fast-charging stations (FCSs). However, random allocation of FCSs and PV adversely impacts the performance and operation of the traffic flow and power networks. Thus, this paper proposes a new planning approach for the optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs in large-scale smart grids and transportation networks. Unlike existing approaches, the well-known Dynamic Network Assignment Simulation for Road Telematics (DYNASMART) is updated and employed in the proposed planning approach to accurately simulate the EVs within the traffic stream. The average waiting time of the EVs at the charging stations (including charging time) and the total annual costs are utilized as conflicting objective functions to be minimized. To effectively solve this comprehensive model with conflicting objectives, a bi-layer multiobjective optimization based on metaheuristic (NSGA-II) and deterministic (GAMS) algorithms is established. The outer layer optimizes the allocation of FCSs and PV accurately, while the inner one optimally dispatches the generated power of the conventional generation units. The proposed planning approach is tested on a 26-bus electrical transmission network and 92-node transportation system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs with 80% EVs penetration increases the net profit by 85.36% while maintaining a maximum of 30 minutes for both charging and waiting time. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2023.101063,2023,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2023.101063,13,high

It allows for accomplishing electricity requirements in periods of high demand and additional storage in case of surplus generation from the grid. Electric vehicles also earn reward points for energy trading. The significant trading data volume processed by the underlying Vehicle-to-Grid infrastructure results in numerous security, privacy and scalability challenges. Researchers suggested various energy trading schemes but suffered from anonymity, large overheads, and dependency on a centralized system, which may cause single-point failure. As a solution, new design principles are desirable to enable the next generation of Vehicle-to-Grid networks. Decentralized energy information networks are a crucial aspect of future power grids, and blockchain technology offers promising potential to support local energy trading and decentralized power generation. Thus, a proposed framework uses the blockchain-based decentralized, secure, and privacy vehicle-to-grid network mutual authentication and energy trading system using elliptic curve cryptography with a scheduling feature. The Proposed scheme is divided into four steps (1) Registration, (2) Scheduling, (3) Mutual authentication and (4) Consensus and energy trading. Distributed ledger blockchain technology makes every transaction valid and authentic, possibly minimizing or eliminating mediators in energy trading, while lightweight elliptical curve cryptography is used for mutual authentication. Further, the performance of our scheme is justified by using the popular AVISPA simulation tool.

This paper sought an optimal coordinated generation scheduling for day-ahead power system operation considering RESs and energy storage units. Renewable power generation, particularly, wind and photovoltaic are uncontrollable, whereas can be predicted using forecasting models. Within the proposed framework, a hyperparameter-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) regression model is employed to forecast the day-ahead weather from the historical time-series weather data. Eventually, an empirical formula is used to estimate the power conversion from the day-ahead weather forecasts for a selected PV module and wind turbine. The objective of the scheduling framework is to keep a delicate supply-demand balance at the lowest possible cost of generation while maintaining the prevailing generation and system constraints. A variance measure uncertainty handling-based grey wolf optimizer (GWO) technique is used to find the optimal day-ahead generation schedules and dispatches under RESs forecast uncertainty. The proposed generation scheduling framework is examined on the IEEE 6 and 30-bus systems. In the studied scenarios, the coordinated operation of generators can decrease the total day-ahead operating cost for the modified IEEE 6-bus system by 2.57% compared to supplying electricity generation with conventional generators alone. Likewise, the total operating cost from the coordinated operation of all generation portfolios was reduced by 6.93% from the operating cost of generation during base case simulation (supply only from dispatchable thermal units) on the modified IEEE 30-bus system. Moreover, the case studies show that coordinated generation scheduling can mitigate the RESs power variability problem, provide secure supply-demand operation, and minimize the operating cost of electricity generation. © 2023 The Authors.

These effects are due to the increased and variable amount of electricity consumption caused by the irregular charging patterns of EVs. As the EV penetration level increases with such irregular charging patterns, the overall load profile in a network will increase resulting in load peaks. To overcome this, a well-planned charging-discharging algorithm is needed for the EV users and the power suppliers. In light of the above issues and requirements, this paper proposes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation-based EV charging (EVC) behavior models and charging-discharging power prediction models. The proposed methods analyze the traveling behavior of EVs, and their charging patterns to make EV a flexible load.

These algorithms apply multiple discretization algorithms rather than a single discretization algorithm that further reduces the computational burden. The approaches mentioned here have resulted in speed-up of up to 18x in the simulation of a single distribution system with 15 XFCs and of up to 271x in the simulation of a transmission-distribution system with 300 XFCs in multiple distribution feeders with respect to conventional simulators (like power systems computer aided design [PSCAD]).",10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3212639,2023,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpwrs.2022.3212639,13,high

This paper proposes an MILP method for the coordinated planning of coupled PDN-TN (CPTN), which determines the optimal deployment of new roads in TN, optimal placement of EVCSs along those roads, and optimal expansion of PDNs to accommodate EVCSs. First, we analyze drivers’ charging and routing behaviors, then develop and solve a bi-level discrete TN model with EVs. Next, we formulate a bi-level CPTN model which includes CPTN investment and PDN operation decisions at the upper level and traffic flow assignment at the lower level. Third, we improve the traffic assignment model to better capture its interplay with EVCS and road investments. Moreover, to tackle the computational complexity of the proposed bi-level model and potential infeasibility under existing method, we propose an improved Big-M method to acquire a tractable MILP solution.

As the volume of EVCS increases, we face challenges related to transformer overloading and power quality issues. In particular, voltage fluctuations in local EVCS become the most critical problem due to the highly unpredictable EV charging loads and renewable energy production. In this study, the DOB estimates the EV charging loads and PV generation power to ensure that the MPVC can compensate for them effectively and minimize the voltage fluctuation of the EVCS. The proposed MPVC with DOB does not require communication system and is obtained by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based optimization problem.

In this regard, this work employs mobile edge computing (MEC) to design a decentralized hierarchical algorithm for finding an optimal path to the nearby A-EV parking lots (PLs), selecting the best PL, and executing an optimal charging scheduling. The proposed model makes use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist edge servers in trajectory planning by surveying road traffic flow in real time. Furthermore, the target PLs are selected using a user-driven multiobjective problem to minimize the cost and waiting time of A-EVs. To tackle the complexity of the optimization problem, a greedy-based algorithm has been developed. Finally, charging/discharging power is scheduled using a local optimizer based on the PLs' real-time loads, which minimizes the deviation of the charging/discharging power from the average load. The obtained results show that the proposed model can handle charging/discharging requests of on-move A-EVs and bring fiscal and nonfiscal benefits for A-EVs and the power grid, respectively.

Two scenarios are addressed: (1) a ‘‘business-as-usual’’ (BAU) scenario with modest ZEV adoption, and (2) a ‘‘carbon neutral’’ scenario that achieves carbon neutrality by 2045 with proactive ZEV adoption. Electricity load for fueling ZEVs is projected, including electricity fuel for battery electric vehicles and electrolytic hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicles. This electric load was input into an electric grid dispatch model and electric grid and air quality analyses were conducted. The results revealed that although medium-and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) are projected to have lower total electric load associated with fueling, they will require roughly double the electricity for hydrogen production of light-duty vehicles. For the electric grid scenarios examined, ZEV loads increased peak electricity demand by 3% to 6% in 2030 and 22% to 31% in 2045. MHDV time-of-use and smart charging strategies were equally able to shift charging demand to off-peak times. Higher ZEV loads under the carbon neutral scenario increased natural gas use up to 6% in 2030 and energy storage requirements up to 45% in 2045 compared with the BAU scenario. The analyses also found that achieving carbon neutrality through ZEV adoption had the cobenefit of significantly reducing ground-level ozone and PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations in key regions of California, providing health savings of approximately $28 billion annually in 2045. © National Academy of Sciences.",10.1177/03611981221121259,2023,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1177/03611981221121259,13,high

In this paper, the scheduling and management framework of an energy hub (EH) is presented with the aim of energy profit maximization in partnership with electricity, natural gas, and district heating networks (EGHNs) considering the coordinated multi-energy management based on the day-ahead market. The optimum capacity of EH equipment, including photovoltaic and wind renewable energy sources, a combined heat and power system (CHP), a boiler, energy storage, and electric vehicles is determined in the day-ahead market using the improved Fick’s law algorithm (IFLA), considering the energy profit maximization and also satisfying the linear network and hub constraints. The conventional FLA is inspired by the concept of Fick’s diffusion law, and, in this study, its performance against premature convergence is improved by using Rosenbrock’s direct rotational method. The performance of the IFLA when applied to EH coordinated scheduling and management problems with the aim of profit maximization is compared with the conventional FLA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) methods. The results show that the proposed scheduling and multi-energy management framework achieves more energy profit in the day-ahead electricity, gas, and heating markets by satisfying the operation and EH constraints compared to other methods. Furthermore, according to the findings, the increased (decreased) demand and the forced outage rate caused a decrease (increase) in the EH profit.

Their travel and charging behaviors have an impact on both the power grid and the road network. In order to address the potential impacts of a large-scale deployment of EVs on the power grid and the exacerbation of traffic congestion, this paper first establishes a dynamic road network model based on graph theory and time-varying traffic data combined with a road impedance model. Then, the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of EV travel are modeled. Furthermore, by incorporating real-time road network data, the traditional Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the optimal path is improved. At each node, the current real-time road impedance is used as the objective for EV path updates, thus accurately capturing the energy consumption of the EVs. Finally, using a standard testing problem on a typical working day based on data from a real case, the impacts of EV travel and charging behaviors on power distribution network operation and traffic congestion are analyzed under scenarios with no guidance and guidance for the shortest travel time. The results show that this method can significantly reduce the time cost by approximately 18% in travel time, which is of particular concern to users.

This paper examines the impacts of a microgrid system considering Electric Vehicle Grid Integration (EVGI) based on stochastic metaheuristic methods. One of the biggest challenges to slowing down global climate change is the transition to sustainable mobility. Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) integrated with Evs are considered a solution for the power and environmental issues needed to achieve Sustainable Development Goal Seven (SDG7) and Climate Action Goal 13 (CAG13). The aforementioned goals can be achieved by coupling Evs with the utility grid and other RESs using Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology to form a hybrid system.

Besides, EV Charging stations (EVCSs) located in inadequate places exacerbate these issues, causing charging demand to concentrate on a few EVCSs. Therefore, the charging demand estimation for EVCSs and their strategic placement is essential for the system operators and charging station owner. The paper proposes a method for optimal EVCS placement to achieve charging demand dispersion considering not only installation cost but also drivers’ preferences and existing charging stations. To optimally place EVCSs, this work first estimates the charging demand of existing EVCSs based on kernel density estimation. The charging demand for new and existing EVCSs is modeled using the nearest neighbor search to consider drivers’ preference for the nearer station. Next, the EVCS placement problem is formulated to minimize the peak charging demand using integer nonlinear programming, a non-convex problem. To tackle this non-convex problem, a minimax genetic algorithm is proposed, which is genetic algorithm combined with game theory. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulations based on real data from Jeju Island.

This categorization mainly concerns the cobalt-containing cathode Li-ion batteries i.e., NMC which is the dominant technology for transportation, and the alternative technology i.e., LFPs with a more recent attention toward them in automobile sector due the cobalt scarcity in the supply chain. This technology shift will impact their end-of-life management at the retirement. In this arrangement, the economic priority of repurposing such battery chemistries needs quantification. This study evaluated the financial return of repurposing retired Li-ion NMC and LFP batteries for energy arbitrage applications in power systems. The feasibility of repurposing is examined in the Irish and Queensland's markets. Results show that retired Li-ion LFPs respond to price fluctuations more frequently with a higher financial return compared to NMCs; thus, they have higher potential for repurposing as such their greater integration in new vehicles is promising from a circular economy perspective. Different rates of return have been observed for various sizes of systems and battery durations. The financial benefits are more prominent for a one-hour battery in a medium system compared to half and two-hour durations and a smaller system. A sensitivity analysis shows that even spending the same capital cost as a new system for a repurposed system results in a marginal financial return in a competitive electricity market like Queensland's, whereas further incentives toward circular-enabling business models from local authorities will effectively make such investments feasible.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2023.107740,2023,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2023.107740,13,high
maybe,,Coordinated integration of distributed energy resources in unit commitment,"Distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles and roof-top solar panels have become increasingly popular and essential components of power distribution systems. However, their growth poses significant challenges to system operation, such as bidirectional power flow, intermittent power generation, increased peak demand, and unexpected frequency/voltage fluctuation. To tackle these challenges, we developed a vehicle-to-grid model, which incorporated dynamic electric vehicles usages, such as driving times, driving distance, and charging/discharging locations. The machine learning method of principal component analysis and XGBoost were used to develop the solar energy prediction model. We also developed a novel unit commitment model to coordinate and aggregate the distributed energy resources in power generation economic dispatch. Electric vehicle charging was used as elastic demand and electric vehicle discharging was used as power generation sources. The solar energy was considered as a negative load. Simulation results showed that uncontrolled electric vehicle charging and solar energy could negatively impact the power systems. For example, the load ramping rate was increased by 384%. Simulation results also showed that the proposed models could mitigate the negative impact and improve energy efficiency. For example, the peak demand, load ramping rate and average generation cost were reduced by 21%, 79%, and 27%.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2022.108671,2023,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2022.108671,13,high
maybe,,Coordinated expansion planning of transmission and distribution systems integrated with smart grid technologies,"Integration of smart grid technologies in distribution systems, particularly behind-the-meter initiatives, has a direct impact on transmission network planning. This paper develops a coordinated expansion planning of transmission and active distribution systems via a stochastic multistage mathematical programming model. In the transmission level, in addition to lines, sitting and sizing of utility-scale battery energy storage systems and wind power plants under renewable portfolio standard policy are planned. Switchable feeders and distributed generations are decision variables in the distribution level while the impact of demand response programs as a sort of behind-the-meter technologies is accommodated as well. Expansion of electric vehicle taxi charging stations is included as a feasible option in both transmission and distribution levels. In order to deal with short-term uncertainty of load demand, renewable energy sources output power, and the charging pattern of electric vehicle taxis in each station, a chronological time-period clustering algorithm along with Monte Carlo simulation is utilized. The proposed model is tackled by means of Benders Dual Decomposition (BDD) method.

maybe,,Optimal design of electric vehicle charging stations for commercial premises,"Influx of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) creates a pressing need for careful charging infrastructure planning. In this paper, the primary goal is to devise a closed-form expression for the PEV charging station capacity problem. Two types of commercial charging stations are considered. The first problem is related to the calculation of the optimal service capacity for charging lots located at workplaces where PEV parking statistics are given as a priori. The second problem, on the other hand, is related to the optimisation of arrival rates for a given station capacity. In the second part, the mathematical models are expanded for the case where multiple charger technologies serve customer demand. This time the goal is to calculate the optimal customer load for each charger type according to its rate. Calculations are carried out for both social and individual optimality cases. Markovian queues are used to model the charging station system to capture the complex interactions between customer load, service waiting times, and electricity cost. The related optimisation problems are solved using convex optimisation methods. Closed-form expressions of station capacity and optimal arrival rates are explicitly derived. Both analytical calculations and discrete-event simulations are carried out and the results show that 60% of the waiting times and 42% of the queue length can be reduced by optimal capacity planning. © 2021 The Authors.

maybe,,A multiobjective planning framework for EV charging stations assisted by solar photovoltaic and battery energy storage system in coupled power and transportation network,"The global shift away from internal combustion (IC) engines and toward electric vehicles (EVs) is well underway. The sustainability of this transition requires a coordinated approach for planning of charging stations integrated with solar photovoltaic (SPV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) with due consideration to the power distribution and transportation network. A two-stage multiobjective planning framework is proposed to find effective service radius, optimal sites, and sizing of fast charging electric vehicle stations (FCEVS), photovoltaic (PV) plants, and battery energy storage systems (BESS). The dynamics of EV charging demand are estimated using EV flow modeling in the M1/M2/N queuing model for the transportation network, which incorporates EV population with multiple battery capacities and waiting time constraints. The multiobjective grey wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithm is used in the first stage to obtain a nondominated solution set for EVCS and PV siting and sizing. The best solution from the nondominated solution set is then obtained using fuzzy satisfaction-based selection. In the second stage, the bisection point method is used iteratively to obtain adequate BESS capacity as well as additional PV capacity required to support EV load during peak traffic hours. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is investigated using a 25-node transportation network coupled to an IEEE 123-bus distribution test system for several scenarios integrating seasonal irradiance and traffic patterns. The findings demonstrate a cost-effective placement of FCEVS with reduction in active power losses, voltage variation, and increased capture of EV flow. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1002/er.7442,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1002/er.7442,13,high
maybe,,Optimal path planning method of electric vehicles considering power supply; 考虑电动汽车电量补给的最优路径规划方法,"Because of the limitations of electric vehicle (EV) battery technology and relevant supporting facilities, there is a great risk of breakdown of EVs during driving. The resulting driver “range anxiety” greatly affects the travel quality of EVs. These limitations should be overcome to promote the use of EVs. In this study, a method for travel path planning considering EV power supply was developed. First, based on real-time road conditions, a dynamic energy model of EVs was established considering the driving energy and accessory energy. Second, a multi-objective travel path planning model of EVs was constructed considering the power supply, taking the distance, time, energy, and charging cost as the optimization objectives. Finally, taking the actual traffic network of 15 km×15 km area in a city as the research object, the model was simulated and verified in MATLAB based on Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional route planning method, the total distance in the proposed optimal route planning method increased by 1.18%, but the energy consumption, charging cost, and driving time decreased by 11.62%, 41.26% and 11.00%, respectively, thus effectively reducing the travel cost of EVs and improving the driving quality of EVs. © 2022, Central South University.",10.1007/s11771-022-4924-x,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s11771-022-4924-x,13,high
maybe,,Optimal deployment of distributed rooftop photovoltaic systems and batteries for achieving net-zero energy of electric bus transportation in high-density cities,"Using rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) and batteries together to power electric buses is considered a novel and feasible approach to reducing carbon emissions and tackling street-level air pollution in high-density cities like Hong Kong. However, associated optimal deployment is highly challenging due to the involved high-dimensional system planning, non-linear component sizing, and complex solar potential accurate characterization. To address this challenge, this study proposed a strategy to minimize the payback period of the deployed rooftop PV and batteries for achieving net-zero energy of electric bus transportation by taking associated grid impacts into consideration. In this strategy, a genetic algorithm-integer linear programming (GA-ILP) approach was developed to solve the high-dimensional rooftop PV planning problem and the non-linear PV and battery sizing problem. Our 3D-GIS (geographic information system) and DL (deep learning) integrated approach was used to attain accurate spatiotemporal rooftop solar power generation profiles. To verify the proposed strategy, a case study covering 5 bus terminuses with 28 bus routes and a total of 1,224 building rooftops surrounding the terminuses was conducted in a real region of Hong Kong. The effectiveness of the developed strategy was verified by comparing the optimized deployment with 150 million Monte-Carlo-generated solutions. The optimized deployment achieved the shortest payback period of 3.98 years by effectively tackling design issues such as battery oversizing, PV misallocation, and battery misallocation. To meet the increasing requirement on peak export power reduction (representing the grid impact constraint in the study), the proposed strategy can find a cost-effective balance between shifting PVs from higher-density solar potential terminuses to lower ones and increasing battery capacity. The proposed strategy can be adopted in practice to facilitate the development of cost-effective and grid-friendly community-solar-powered electric bus networks in high-density cities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119274,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119274,13,high
maybe,,Dynamic energy scheduling and routing of a large fleet of electric vehicles using multi-agent reinforcement learning,"As the world's population and economy grow, demand for energy increases as well. Smart grids can be a cost-effective solution to overcome increases in energy demand and ensure power security. Current applications of smart grids involve a large numbers of agents (e.g., electric vehicles). Since each agent must interact with other agents when taking decisions (e.g., movement and scheduling), the computational complexity of smart grid systems increases exponentially with the number of agents. Computational tractability of planning is a significant barrier to implementation of large-scale smart grids of electric vehicles. Existing solution approaches such as mixed-integer programming and dynamic programming are not computationally efficient for high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a reformulation of a Mixed-Integer Programming model into a Decentralized Markov Decision Process model and solves it using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to address the scalability issues of large-scale smart grid systems. The Decentralized Markov Decision Process model uses centralized training and distributed execution: agents are trained using a unique actor network for each agent and a shared critic network, and then agent execute actions independently from other agents to reduce computation time. The performance of the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning model is assessed under different configurations of customers and electric vehicles, and compared to the results from deep reinforcement learning and three heuristic algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm can reduce simulation time significantly compared to deep reinforcement learning, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and the artificial fish swarm algorithm. The superior performance of the proposed method indicates that it may be a realistic solution for large-scale implementation. © 2022",10.1016/j.cie.2022.108180,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.cie.2022.108180,13,high
maybe,,Impact assessment of electric vehicles as curtailment mitigating mobile storage in high PV penetration grid,"Electric vehicles are seen as a potential solution in reducing the fossil fuel dependence of the transport sector and could also serve as secondary storage for renewable energy. This study aims to clarify the role of EV in managing curtailment in electricity grid with high PV penetration. An energy balance analysis was conducted to assess the impact of various EV adoption rates and PV capacity growth rates on curtailment throughout a 10-year planning period. Results show that EV as mobile storage has a significant impact in reducing curtailment. In the case of Kyushu, Japan, the analysis showed that 20 GWh was sufficient by 2031. It will require 300,000 to 570,000 electric vehicles as mobile storage to reach this capacity, depending on the combinations of EV classes used. Additional capacity will only benefit spring and autumn, which does not merit an increased target due to the low capacity factor. Following the logistics growth model, the current adaption rate is insufficient to reach target volume, and external support will be necessary. EV as mobile storage can keep the curtailment to around 10%–15% but has less impact initially; thus, stalling the additional capacity until sufficient EV capacity is available might be necessary to keep the curtailment below 10%. Overall, EV as secondary storage is ideal for regions experiencing PV curtailment, and cars are only used for specific activities. © 2021 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.egyr.2021.11.223,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2021.11.223,13,high
maybe,,Metaheuristic-based isolated microgrid sizing and uncertainty quantification considering EVs as shiftable loads,"Isolated microgrids are increasingly recognised as an effective platform for the optimal coordination of integrated distributed energy resources – including renewable energy generation and storage technologies – for remote, island, and peripheral communities. However, they require advanced off-grid microgrid capacity planning optimisation models to achieve the globally optimum sizing results. In this context, while considerable attention has been devoted to a range of off-grid microgrid sizing methods, leveraging the potential of metaheuristic optimisation algorithms is less well-explored. Furthermore, there is a general lack of electrified transportation interventions considered during long-term grid-independent microgrid planning phases. In response, this paper introduces a novel metaheuristic-based strategic off-grid microgrid capacity planning optimisation model that is applicable to associated integrated energy and e-mobility resource planning problems. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, three independent microgrid development projects have been considered for three communities residing on Aotea–Great Barrier Island in Aotearoa–New Zealand. The sites of interest have different demand profiles and renewable energy potentials – with consequent changes in the technologies considered in the associate candidate pools. Moreover, to generate key insights into the impact of the forecast uncertainty of different variables on the costing and configuration of the associated microgrids, a number of scenario analyses have been performed. In addition, the numeric simulation results and the associated capital budgeting analyses have demonstrated the economic viability of the project proposals formulated based on the proposed off-grid microgrid planning method, especially with controlling the charging of electric vehicles. Particularly, the potential of the artificial hummingbird algorithm in reducing the total discounted costs of off-grid microgrids by at least ∼6% has been shown. Also, the importance of electric vehicle charging coordination in reducing the off-grid microgrid costs (by at least ∼9%) has been substantiated. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.egyr.2022.08.254,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2022.08.254,13,high
maybe,,Controlled V2Gs and battery integration into residential microgrids: Economic and environmental impacts,"The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) represents a huge burden on the electrical grid.

This study introduces a multi-objective power scheduling of a residential microgrid that consists of PV, wind generator (WG), EVs, and battery energy storage system (BESS). It also presents a comparison between two energy management techniques: renewable base control (RBC) and load base control (LBC) for controlling plug-in-electric vehicles’ charging and discharging. The novelty of this work depends on holding a comparison between four sizing scenarios of residential load to verify the economic feasibility and environmental viability of integrating EVs into microgrids; and introducing a control technique for charging and discharging battery energy storage system (BESS) with the consideration of ToU prices and EVs’ power. Also, conducting a comparison between two optimization algorithms for confirming the effectiveness of the control techniques.

maybe,,Planning integrated energy systems coupling V2G as a flexible storage,"Coupling the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) with integrated energy systems (IES) offers an emerging solution for decarbonisation of both energy and transport sectors. To evaluate the feasibility of coupling V2G with IES as a flexible storage, we propose an optimisation-based system planning framework embedding V2G into IES. Within this framework, stochastic features of electric vehicles (EV) fleets are simulated. The impacts of V2G on IES design are captured by assessing both economic and environmental benefits via multi-objective optimisations utilising an improved NSGA-II algorithm. Six case studies considering three cities with different climate conditions and two functional areas of residential and commercial are performed. The results manifest that Beijing-commercial case could achieve the largest mutual benefits. The EV fleets’ charging behaviour follows the time-of-use energy tariff in transition seasons while not during winter. Sensitivity analysis indicates the electricity and gas prices have significant impact on the system design. The benefits induced by growing EV penetration would gradually decrease and stabilise when the EV number reach 300, the growth of economic and environmental benefits stabilized at 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. Overall, this study quantifies the benefits of enabling V2G in IES, and generates valuable insights for IES planners, V2G service providers, and relevant policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2021.122215,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2021.122215,13,high
maybe,,Urban regeneration plans: Bridging the gap between planning and design energy districts,"District regeneration plans introduce demographic and land use changes that influence their energy balance, modifying electricity and heating/cooling demand. Traditional approaches see urban regeneration projects as independent processes with respect to the energy planning ones, ignoring the European Union targets to move towards the energy transition. Smart energy district approach allows to better solutions from the thermodynamic and economic point of view, and to integrate renewable energy sources, which by their nature are ‘fluctuating,’ with the energy demands using a data centre to menage the energy flows. To evaluate the benefits that a district could obtain when integrating energy planning in regeneration plans, the authors analyse the effects of a different approach to the urban design that goes beyond the traditional tasks of designing districts’ spatial aspects and propose a consistent technical analysis during the decision-making process. To do this, after defining strategic targets related to energy and resource issues, the authors implement different scenarios, evaluating the most suitable technologies that can be integrated in the area. The process of modelling and simulating the energy system hour by hour enables to identify the synergies among the energy sectors. This is done by creating models using different energy tools, as the ones used in this work. The research work analyses a real case for a possible process of urban regeneration, of former industrial area in a district located in the city of Naples, through retrofit and re-use of existing buildings, the construction of new ones and the implementation of smart infrastructures. The overall goal of this work is to present and evaluate different development configuration of a smart energy district when going from the planning to the design phase. The analysed system is designed for matching the power and thermal flow rate demands of the district considered, including the power demand of electric vehicles charging stations, as well as the energy for space heating and cooling. A technoeconomic analysis of three technical alternatives has been implemented, each one characterized by a different energy mix, allowing to verify the most suitable option between the individual and central heating and cooling supply.

maybe,,Implications of electric vehicle promotion policy on the road transport and electricity sectors for Thailand,"This paper aims to analyze the implications of electric vehicle (EV) promotion policy on the Thai road transport and electricity sectors. For this purpose, this paper develops three scenarios representing different levels of EV penetration and assesses the scenario impacts with a view to identify policy implications and policy trade-offs of an increased EV deployment. A Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) model is employed, in this study, to assess the scenario impacts for the period 2020–2037. The analyses showed that high EV deployment in the transport sector would provide noticeable benefits, for example, reducing energy demand in the transport sector, decreasing primary energy requirements, and mitigating emissions of CO<inf>2</inf>, NOx and PM2.5. An increase in electricity generation would be, however, required for supporting increased EVs. The analyses further revealed that the impacts of high EV adoption in the transport sector could be considered in terms of both emerging challenges and opportunities. In terms of emerging challenges, promotion of EV adoption would pose several challenges including electricity grid impacts, energy security issues, and impacts on related industries. In order to address these challenges, the development of long-term electricity planning taking into account various issues, for example, a mixture of generating capacity additions, infrastructure expansion, coordinated charging, and time-of-use tariff setting would be essentially needed. EVs deployment would also bring several opportunities including the implementation of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology in smart grid and integration of renewable energy with V2X in smart grid. The success of these opportunities would, however, require policy supports from the Thai government and also the development of a consistent policy framework considering all related sectors.

maybe,,Dynamic long-term expansion planning of electric vehicle parking lots considering lost opportunity cost and energy saving,"In this paper, a practical approach is presented to long-term expansion planning of electric vehicle (EV) parking lots which aims to maximize the parking lot operator's profit. The optimal number, location, capacity, and time for construction or expansion of EV parking lots have also been determined. Moreover, a method based on drivers' travel patterns is proposed to estimate the number of EVs referring to each area, in which the unscented transformation method (UTM) is used to calculate the annual growth rate of EVs. An innovative and real-time method for optimal charge and discharge scheduling of EVs is also provided, which can calculate the parking lots' demand at different times. The most important advantages of this method are its independence from iterative-based optimization algorithms and from modeling some input parameters such as the initial state of charge (SOC) and the arrival time of EVs into the parking lot as uncertain parameters. Also, a Lagrange interpolation-based method is proposed to minimize the energy consumption required for EVs to reach a parking lot. In addition, in order to prevent the reduction of parking lot operator's profit in case of non-fulfillment of the obligations of the EV owners, an approach based on paying the lost opportunity cost (LOC) is presented. Real -world data has been used for numerical studies. The results show that based on travel patterns and estimating the number of EVs available in each municipal district and using the proposed real-time scheduling method, parking lot's demand can be calculated as the main prerequisite for parking lots expansion planning. Also, the proposed method for parking selection compared to two other methods will save energy by 26.6\% and 8.33\%, respectively.

According to the actual charging transactions big data of Shanxi, the construction sequence of regional public charging facilities has been studied, which verified the scientificity and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the charging facilities demand of 11 cities in Shanxi can be divided into 4 types, Linfen and Lvliang having the highest demand for charging facilities in the short term and long term; in the same city, the utilization of charging stations in residential areas is the highest, and the utilization of charging stations in working areas is the lowest; so, the charging facilities construction should focus on residential areas in Linfen and Lvliang.

In particular, public transportation allows massive transportation of passengers, but it remains highly polluting, especially in high elevation cities. Thus, the progressive introduction of electric buses (EBS) will allow mitigating these environmental concerns.

Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to the security of the smart grid. It is possible for any Electric Vehicle (EV), charging station (CS), or other components to be compromised, and they can infect other stations too. This problem can damage even the central infrastructure. We can prevent the spread of attacks by isolating the high-risk stations. Researches in this area have not considered the availability of charging infrastructure, and they only tried to reduce the speed of threat propagation. EV battery capacity is limited, and they need charging at several stations during a trip. So availability of specified stations along the route to recharge the vehicles is critical. We first present a model that minimizes security risk and maximizes the availability of the stations. Second, we propose another model for EVs itinerary planning that detects the best plans according to their status, system topology, and threat level of stations. Our model is used to minimize the outage probability of stations and infection propagation speed in peak time. This model also reduces the tour time of the EVs.

This research presents a two-stage optimization strategy, for improving the economic and environment-friendly operation of MG considering EVs integration. In Stage 1, model of EVs under coordinate charging/discharging stimulated by time-of-use incentive mechanism is established, and the peak–valley hours are dynamically divided to obtain a load curve with minimized peak-to-valley difference (PVD). In Stage 2, aiming for the best tradeoff between the generation cost and pollutant emission, daily optimal scheduling of the MG generators is efficiently calculated according to the varying power demand. For enhancing the convergence, an advanced genetic algorithm with elite preservation strategy is employed. Two cases from a residential MG system is exploited to validate the proposed method, and the results show that firstly the power supply pressure could be obviously relieved owing to the load shifting effect of the coordinated vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service reflected by the decreased PVD (Case 1: from 76.16 to 54.35 kW, Case 2: from 76.25 to 46.19 kW); simultaneously, via applicable power planning of the MG components, cost saving and emission reduction can be both achieved (Case 1: ¥190.12 under V2G management compared to ¥281.66 under basic load, Case 2: ¥177.28 compared to ¥350.24), ensuring the feasibility of the control strategy, which promotes the economic-environmental and reliable operation of the MG system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100872,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2022.100872,13,high
maybe,,Optimal integration of Vehicle to Building (V2B) and Building to Vehicle (B2V) technologies for commercial buildings,"The advent of vehicle-to-building (V2B) technology provides an option to export electricity from the battery in electric vehicles (EVs) into buildings to assist in meeting building electric demands. However, there are some constraints on operating the EV fleets as flexible energy storage for buildings, including (i) stochastic and limited availability of EVs for building energy management; and (ii) necessity of bi-directional flow of EVs to operate in both V2B and building-to-vehicle (B2V) modes. Hence, these constraints and the changing degree of electric energy exchange provided by the different numbers of EVs could affect the building energy management system and the dynamic energy usage. The main objectives of this paper are to study the optimal configurations of the number of EVs interacting with a building by examining (1) the impact of different numbers of EVs on the daily electricity bills in a grid-connected commercial building microgrid, (2) the range of allowable EV numbers that enable optimal V2B capacity and reasonable charging loads for enhancing the cost-effectiveness of building energy management; (3) the role of different EV numbers in affecting the required stationary battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity in an isolated commercial building microgrid. It is observed that optimal building connected EV numbers are determined by EV driving patterns, seasonal solar output, building demand profiles, and the price of grid electricity. Thus, a scenario analysis is conducted to determine a range of suitable EV numbers in each scenario. Simulation results indicate that the optimal number of EVs varies greatly between summer and winter, as well as across different solar irradiance scenarios. In a case study where a building's peak electric consumption is 30 kW and the PV system's rated capacity is 50 kW, the allowable EV number, depending on the amount of available solar energy, varies from 8 to 29 in summer and changes from 2 to 15 in winter. These results could be used to suggest the optimal EV numbers based on the day-ahead solar energy forecasting, enabling day-ahead planning to either attract more vehicle owners to boost V2B capacity or to limit the number of integrated EVs in order to avoid a spike in total EV charging demand. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2022.100921,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2022.100921,13,high
maybe,,A comparative analysis for impact of distributed generations with electric vehicles planning,"In the approaching years, the utilization of Distributed Generations (DGs) with Electric Vehicles (EVs) will accelerate. Future issues will be exacerbated by the relationship between the distribution system of DGs solely, DGs with Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), and DGs with Extended Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (Ex-PHEV). This paper discusses the use of a multi-tasking Genetic Algorithm to optimize DGs with EVs planning in distribution systems for load models for rating and placement determination. From a system perspective, the goal of this research is to reduce total real power loss. The various types of DGs with EVs are taken into account from the standpoint of the analysis. Photovoltaic, diesel engines, synchronous condensers, and doubly-fed induction generators are examples of various types of DGs. In this analysis, EV types such as FCEV and Ex-PHEV are considered. Different forms of constant impedance (Z), constant current (I), and constant power (P) load models are included in DGs with EVs planning for improving system performance indices, such as Light-emitting diode, Laptop charger, Personal computer, Tungsten light, and Vacuum tube. The real power loss index (% ILP), the reactive power loss index (% ILQ), the voltage deviation index (% IVD), the short circuit current reduction (% IC), the active power DGs with EVs penetration (% P<inf>PWDGs & EVs</inf>), and the reactive power DGs with EVs penetration (% P<inf>QWDGs & EVs</inf>) are all measured in this paper. On the 37-bus test distribution system, the effectiveness of the listed approach was verified.

maybe,,Optimal energy management in a microgrid under uncertainties using novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm,"Smart home users play a significant role to implement a demand response strategy in managing the total power network by curtailing or shifting their electricity usage during peak periods in response to Time-of-Use rates. In Time-of-use metering, utility companies’ electricity charge is higher during peak periods. This paper presents the development of an optimal energy management system by incorporating a demand response strategy to operate and sustain the efficiency and reliability of microgrids at a satisfactory level. The long short-term memory recurrent neural network model has been developed based on a novel hybrid metaheuristic grasshopper and flower pollination algorithm to forecast load demand and renewable energy generation for planning day-ahead schedules. Price-based demand response strategy is applied for a microgrid with the effect of penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to shave off the peak load of the main grid. The simulation study has been done to show the efficacy of the energy management system in terms of reduced operational cost, unit commitment, and load forecasting under uncertain conditions. The accuracy of the forecasting model is satisfied with an RMSE value of 0.17861 for PV power and 0.47844 in the case of wind power. The load demand is reduced by 26.14% using the time-of-use price-based demand response strategy. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.suscom.2022.100819,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.suscom.2022.100819,13,high
maybe,,Human settlements arranged as networks of regenerative villages with nature-based infrastructure ecosystems,"Civil infrastructures have historically been developed as highly centralised, extensive, and complicated systems. Electricity, water, buildings, transport networks, and communication systems are each delivered separately. Recent advancements in the development of energy micro-grids have opened the possibility of localised, intensive, and complex, nature-based infrastructure ecosystems. Designed at the scale of a village, such systems would integrate different types of infrastructure. For example, an energy micro-grid can provide electricity to buildings, power electric vehicles and cycle water through a precinct. In turn, the water system can store energy and irrigate a diverse, regenerative food system. Providing housing close to food production reduces transport costs, supply chain losses and packaging. The significant land area required for each village would result in a dispersal of populations, creating networks of villages, each with integrated infrastructure ecosystems. This challenges the orthodoxy in town planning and regional economics that accepts ever-increasing urbanisation. To synthesise ideas developed in different disciplines we adopt the epistemology of consilience. That is, a conclusion can be confirmed when different disciplines arrive at that same position. We show that literature in town planning, regional economics, ecological economics, and public health all support the argument for dispersal reached through civil engineering systems. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/10286608.2022.2128341,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1080/10286608.2022.2128341,13,high

The proposed hybrid scheme is the joint execution of both the balancing composite motion optimization (BCMO) and the political optimizer (PO); hence, it is called the BCMPO technique. The balancing composite motion properties are enhanced by political optimizer algorithm. Here, allocation of the parking lot (PL) including capacitor is presented for congestion management (CM) along with reactive power compensation. BCMPO technique is adopted to optimally determine the size of the PL. The propsoed approach is used to reduce the active and reactive power loss and voltage fluctuation by optimally siting the EVPL. The proposed BCMPO model is performed in MATLAB/Simulink platform, and then the performance is compared with other models.

maybe,,Analysis of Microgrid's Operation Integrated to Renewable Energy and Electric Vehicles in View of Multiple Demand Response Programs,"A suitable energy management scheme and integrating renewable energy resources (RERs) can significantly increase energy efficiency and the stability of future grids operation. This work modeled a household energy management comprising a microgrid (MG) system and demand response programs (DRPs). Residential loads with price-based tariffs are introduced to reduce peak load demands and energy costs. For incorporating the uncertainties in RERs, their stochastic nature is modeled with a probabilistic method. This paper proposes a joint optimization approach for the optimal planning and operation of grid-connected residential, rural MG integrated into renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs) in view of DRPs. The investigation focuses on energy saving of residential homes under different DRPs and RERs integration. The EVs are integrated into MG by including photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), fuel cell (FC), and diesel engines (DEs). A multi-objective optimization problem has been formulated to minimize the operating cost, pollutant treatment cost, and carbon emissions cost defined as C1, C2, and C3, respectively. The load demand has been rescheduled because of three DRPs, i.e., critical peak pricing (CPP), real-time electricity pricing (RTEP), and time of use (TOU). Further, the EV load has also been analyzed in autonomous and coordinated charging strategies. Using a judgement matrix, the proposed multi-objective problem is transformed into a single-objective problem. The results of an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm are compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The simulation analysis was accomplished by employing ABC and PSO in MATLAB. The mathematical model of MG was implemented, and the effects of DRPs based MG were investigated under different numbers of EVs and load data to reduce different costs. To analyze the impact of DRPs, the residential, rural MG is implemented for 50 homes with a peak load of 5 kW each and EV load with 80 EVs and 700 EVs, respectively. The simulation results with different test cases are formulated while analyzing the tradeoff between ABC and PSO algorithms. The simulation analysis shows that multiple DRPs, EVs, and RERs offered a substantial trade-off. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140587,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2022.3140587,13,high
maybe,,Location Determination of Electric Vehicles Parking Lot With Distribution System by Mexican AXOLOTL Optimization and Wild Horse Optimizer,"In this manuscript proposes a hybrid approach for locating and sizing Electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) optimally and managing the vehicle charging process. The proposed hybrid approach is to work in conjunction with Mexican Axolotl optimization (MAO) and Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO) hence it is named as MAOWHO approach. The major purposes of the proposed approach are to site and size of the electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL) and to improve the benefit of EVPL for the participation of the reserve market. In addition, power loss and voltage fluctuations occur due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EV) demand load, which is reduced by the proposed approach. To optimally determine the size of the parking lot, the MAOWHO approach is adopted. The integration of the EV and PV systems, especially in parking lots, enhances the reliability and flexibility of the electrical system at critical moments. Multiple objective optimization problems are calculated to achieve objective variables to reduce power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and supply costs, and EV costs. The location and capacity of the RES and EV charging stations in this optimization problem are objective variables. The MAOWHO approach enhances Solar Powered Electric Vehicle Parking Lot (EVSPL) participation in various energy and ancillary service markets that includes the effects of capacity payments. Besides, the implementation of MAOWHO approach is done by the MATLAB/Simulink platform and the performance of the MAOWHO approach is compared to the existing approaches.

There are increasing efforts to directly model real large-scale networks and conduct detailed analysis beyond conventional practices. Utilizing optimization methods to leverage distributed generation to the benefit of the distribution system and all customers is the ideal. However, progress towards adoption of such controls by system operators are impeded by concerns over privacy, regulatory and market issues in many jurisdictions. While these issues are being addressed, there may be opportunity to exploit the synergistic effect of mixing low carbon technologies (LCT).

maybe,,Integrated Multi-Criteria Model for Long-Term Placement of Electric Vehicle Chargers,"Based on the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets, governments all over the world are speeding up the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). However, one of the key challenges in designing the novel EV system is to forecast the accurate time for the replacement of conventional vehicles and optimization of charging vehicles. Designing the charging infrastructure for EVs has many impacts such as stress on the power network, increase in traffic flow, and change in driving behaviors. Therefore, the optimal placement of charging stations is one of the most important issues to address to increase the use of electric vehicles. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to present an optimization method for choosing optimal locations for electric car charging stations for Campus charging over long-term planning. The charger placement problem is formulated as a complex Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) which combines spatial analysis techniques, power network load flow, traffic flow models, and constrained procedures. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is used to determine the optimal weights of the criteria, while the mean is used to determine the distinct weights for each criterion using the AHP in terms of accessibility, environmental effect, power network indices, and traffic flow impacts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to a real case study of Qatar University with collected certain attributes data and relevant decision makers as the inputs to the linguistic assessments and MCDM model. The Ranking of the optimal locations is done by aggregating four techniques: Simple Additive Weighting Method (SAW, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE-II).

maybe,,Optimal Planning of Charging Stations in Coupled Transportation and Power Networks Based on User Equilibrium Conditions,"In this article, we propose a new bi-level approach for the location and sizing of charging stations (CSs) based on the integration of power distribution and traffic networks. At the lower level, the user choices and the energy demands are modeled through the user equilibrium (UE) traffic assignment conditions that are derived for the case of electric vehicles (EVs). At the higher level, an optimization problem is formalized for the optimal planning of locations, sizes, and unit prices of a set of new charging stations in a territory, which embeds the UE conditions and the power flow model as constraints. The main novelties lie in the integration of traffic and electric networks, the optimization problem formalization, and the inclusion of detailed electrical issues [such as the complete alternating current (AC) power flow equations and the modeling of CSs with different phases]. The developed model has been applied to a case study in the Genoa Municipality. Note to Practitioners—In the past decade, particular attention has been posed on EVs and renewable resources to reduce pollutants’ emissions. Critical issues regard the setting of adequate recharging infrastructure and the integration of huge distributed and intermittent loads and production into the electrical grid. This article aims to provide a bi-level optimization model that can be used by companies or public administrations that want to install charging stations in a territory. In particular, the transportation and the electrical networks are integrated: at a lower level, the UE traffic assignment conditions are derived to represent users’ choices and to assess the energy demand.

Conventionally, the PM materials are inserted in the flux barriers region of the rotor. Consequently, the PMs sizing parameters will be restricted to the available space that may limit the efficient use of PMs benefits. In this study, a portion of the rotor structure is replaced with an Interior PM (IPM) rotor so that an axially segmented integration of IPM and SyRM is obtained. Thus, the PMs design is performed specifically in the IPM segment independent of the SyRM scheme, while the SyRM segment remains PM-less. The main motivation of this concept is to improve the contribution of the PM material in the total torque as well as utilizing the special property of the proposed rotor configuration for pulsating torque reduction. A computationally cost-effective algorithm is proposed for the optimal design of IPM-SyRM motor by which a low-power design is carried out for a lightweight electric vehicle.

Rule-based home energy management systems (HEMSs) are developed for two different configurations of the GCH: 1) with only SWT and 2) with SWT and BES. For each configuration, the HEMSs are developed for two cases: with and without an EV in the premises of the GCH. Uncertainties are also included in the arrival time, departure time, and initial state of charge (at arrival) of the EV. The abovementioned technique is then applied to a typical household in South Australia using the yearly load profile of the household and actual yearly wind speed data at an interval of one hour. To investigate the effects of stochastic nature of household load, EV, and wind power generation on various results, the optimization process is repeated using 10-year of actual wind speed data and probabilistic load and EV uncertainties. The results of several sensitivity analyses of various system parameters are presented.

maybe,,"A 300 kHz, 63 kW/L ZVT DC–DC Converter for 800-V Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles","In this article, one of the very first 800-V fuel cell DC–DC converter (FDC) is developed for the next-generation fuel cell electric vehicles. The higher boost gain ratio and switching loss associated with increasing dc-link voltage, along with gradually increasing power density and efficiency demanded in the next-generation EV power converters, make the conventional boost converter not suitable for 800-V FDC. This article proposes a new design approach in which a zero voltage transition (ZVT) high step-up dual floating output boost converter (DFOBC) is introduced. Due to higher voltage gain, the operating duty cycle of DFOBC is reduced and lies in the vicinity of D = 0.5, which reduces filter size. The ZVT cells greatly reduce switching losses at 300 kHz, which enables using only a single discrete SiC mosfet for the main switch of 25-kW module, contributing to volume and cost reduction. Moreover, the proposed converter successfully demonstrates the possibility of using planar core and printed circuit board (PCB) windings at 100-kW power level, which is rarely seen in previous works. Finally, a 25-kW prototype of the proposed ZVT DFOBC is built and test. The power density of 63 kW/L excluding heatsink is achieved.

However, the switching loss and conduction losses degrade the overall efficiency of 3LT2C. The generated heat due to the losses endangers the reliability of the device and shortens its service life. To relieve the power losses as well as maintain high-quality current output, a low-loss-tolerant sequential model predictive control (LL-TSMPC) is proposed. First, based on the energy loss analysis under switching transitions per commutation, the prediction models of both switching loss and conduction loss are established. Second, the total loss reduction is considered as one control objective in LL-TSMPC. Finally, because multiobjective model predictive control (MPC) requires selecting appropriate weighting factors, complicating the design to solve this problem, TSMPC-based lexicographic optimization is introduced to eliminate the tradeoff factors and simplify the MPC controller design. The proposed method is tested on the hardware platform with the rated power of a 10-kW prototype.

Due to the uncertainties of wind turbine/photovoltaic power outputs, an improved rolling ultra-short-term forecast method with high reliability is proposed, which is based on long short-term memory networks, and the superiority is proved by comparing with multi-layer perception neural networks, linear regression, support vector regression and random forest. Then, two stochastic optimization models are constructed, one is based on CPS, the other is based on CPSS. As for social factors, electric vehicle aggregator is stimulated by cost to actively participate in the dispatch operation.

maybe,,Multistage Planning Model for Active Distribution Systems and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Considering Voltage-Dependent Load Behavior,"This work proposes a novel mixed-integer linear programming model for the medium-term multistage planning of active distribution systems and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). Investment alternatives include the installation of conductors, capacitor banks, voltage regulators, dispatchable and nondispatchable distributed generation, energy storage units, and EVCSs. Hence, the model identifies the best size, location, and installation time for the candidate assets under the uncertainty associated with electricity demand, energy prices, renewable energy sources, and EVCSs’ load profiles. Unlike classical planning approaches, conventional load is modeled as voltage-dependent. Besides, EVCSs are planned by zones to optimize the coverage of the service provided to users of electric vehicles and to reduce the discrepancy between the geographical requirements and the optimal locations for the installation of EVCSs in the system. EVCSs’ load profiles are calculated using a travel simulation algorithm based on real travel patterns that consider fast, slow, and residential chargers. Moreover, as another salient feature, constraints for CO2 emissions are incorporated into the model. The resulting model is formulated as a stochastic scenario-based program, which is driven by the minimization of the total expected cost. Tests are conducted using a 69-node system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",10.1109/TSG.2021.3125786,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2021.3125786,13,high
maybe,,Coincidence Factors for Domestic EV Charging From Driving and Plug-In Behavior,"This study models the coincidence factor (CF) of electric vehicle (EV) charging given driving and plug-in behaviors by combining data sources from travel surveys and recorded EV charging data. From these, we generate travel and plug-in behaviors by using a Monte Carlo approach to derive CFs. By varying the EV battery size, the rated charging power, and the plug-in behavior, their influence on the CF is examined. The key results show that the CF decreases to less than 25% when considering more than 50 EVs with a charging level of 11 kW, with the CF strongly depending on the number of EVs considered. By contrast, the driving behavior and the battery size have a minor influence on the CF. Furthermore, when mixing the parameters, such as EV battery size and rated charging power, then, especially, the active power drawn by the feeder does not change linearly. Ultimately, the study aims to add to the state-of-the-art by solely and systematically focusing on the CF and its sensitivity to a number of key factors.

maybe,,Planning Strategy for an Electric Vehicle Fast Charging Service Provider in a Competitive Environment,"Fast charging is a promising method of energy refueling for electric vehicles (EVs), significantly shortening the refueling time to a level comparable with traveling and queuing times, which consequently will highly influence the decision of charging places for EV users. Multiple charging service providers (CSPs) are participating in the investment of EV fast charging facilities, inevitably bringing competition among each other, which affects the planning decision of investors. This article studies the planning strategy of EV fast charging infrastructure in a competitive environment, taking the queuing impacts on EV users into consideration. A double-loop iterative methodology is proposed, and the outer loop seeks the equilibrium point of the CSP’s planning schemes. A user equilibrium traffic assignment model integrated with queuing theory and an adaptive route selection algorithm are built in the inner loop to optimize the planning scheme of a CSP, along with a station-level linear programming model to obtain the optimal sizes and operation scheduling of on-site energy storage systems (ESSs) considering time-of-use prices and investment constraints.

Specifically, the analysis focuses on the comparison of 3 lithium-ion battery technologies (NMC, LTO and LFP) and 8 energy management strategies (including rule-based and optimization-based strategies). In order to develop this analysis, a methodology that returns the life cycle cost of each proposed case is presented. The methodology includes the optimization of the diesel generator and lithium-ion battery sizing. A scenario based on a real railway line is introduced, and the obtained results are compared to a traditional diesel-electric railway vehicle to develop a techno-economical discussion. The best lithium-ion battery technologies are found to be LTO and NMC, and the most appropriated strategy a state-machine controller optimised by a genetic algorithm approach. The best case obtains a life cycle cost reduction of the 4.0% and diesel savings of the 13.7% compared to a traditional diesel-electric railway vehicle.

maybe,,Energy Management in the Microgrid and Its Optimal Planning for Supplying Wireless Charging Electric Vehicle,"The ongoing research work on electric vehicles (EVs) as well as the growing concern around the world to ensure a pollution-free environment is sure to lead to a significant increase in the number of EVs in the near future. The electrification of automobiles is an inevitable trend of future development. However, the growth of EVs relies on several elements: autonomy, the charging practice and infrastructure, the price, and the high amount of energy needed for supplying EV. This tendency impacts several points in transportation such as the road infrastructure and electrical power network. The aim of this article is the integration of new energy power sources as a part of the microgrid (MG) to supply EV with dynamic wireless charging. The main goal is to establish an energy management strategy reducing the running cost. The purpose is suggested for two kinds of operation mode: relying only on the MG (island mode) or relying on the MG and the large grid (grid-connected). The optimization problem is solved on the basis of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. We could note that the stability of the microgrid in the off-grid mode is better, when the load is close to the output power of the distributed power supply. Through the coordination and cooperation of the battery output and the other two distributed power generation units, the microgrid can achieve its autonomy and maximize the economy of the system operation. Thanks to our methodology, a better revenue and an enhanced flexible dispatching of the system were met in the grid-connected mode as well. © © 2022 Salma Sraidi and Mohamed Maaroufi.",10.1155/2022/5923568,2022,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1155/2022/5923568,13,high
maybe,,Comparison of Grid Reactive Voltage Regulation with Reconfiguration Network for Electric Vehicle Penetration,"Renewable energy sources and EV growth brings new challenges for grid stabilization. Smart grid techniques are required to reconfigure and compensate for load fluctuation and stabilize power losses and voltage fluctuation. Numerical tools are available to equip the smart grid to deal with such challenges. Distribution Feeder reconfiguration and reactive voltage injection to the disturbed grid are some of the techniques employed for the purpose. However, either reconfiguration or injection alone is used commonly for this purpose. In this study, both techniques are applied to EV penetration as load and compared. A balanced IEEE 33 Radial network is used in this study and selected branches with high power losses are targeted for the reactive voltage injection and Minimum Spanning tree techniques (MST). EV charging loads are usually modelled with time base distribution which requires times base power flow analysis for reactive power injection. A comparison between coordinated, reconfiguration, and reactive voltage injection shows differences in power losses, voltage distortion, and cost saving. The analysis is carried out with an integer linear programming technique for coordinated charging, a minimum spanning tree for network reconfiguration, and genetic optimization for reactive power injection. Besides, all power flow analyses are carried out with the Backward/Forward sweep method.

maybe,,Surrogate DC Microgrid Models for Optimization of Charging Electric Vehicles under Partial Observability,"Many electric vehicles (EVs) are using today’s distribution grids, and their flexibility can be highly beneficial for the grid operators. This flexibility can be best exploited by DC power networks, as they allow charging and discharging without extra power electronics and transformation losses. From the grid control perspective, algorithms for planning EV charging are necessary. This paper studies the problem of EV charging planning under limited grid capacity and extends it to the partially observable case. We demonstrate how limited information about the EV locations in a grid may disrupt the operation planning in DC grids with tight constraints. We introduce two methods to change the grid topology such that partial observability of the EV locations is resolved. The suggested models are evaluated on the IEEE 16 bus system and multiple randomly generated grids with varying capacities. The experiments show that these methods efficiently solve the partially observable EV charging planning problem and offer a trade-off between computational time and performance. © 2022 by the authors.

maybe,,"Home Energy Management Considering Renewable Resources, Energy Storage, and an Electric Vehicle as a Backup","The vehicle-to-grid concept emerged very quickly after the integration of renewable energy resources because of their intermittency and to support the grid during on-peak periods, consequently preventing congestion and any subsequent grid instability. Renewable energies offer a large source of clean energy, but they are not controllable, as they depend on weather conditions. This problem is solved by adding energy storage elements, implementing a demand response through shiftable loads, and the vehicle-to-grid/vehicle-to-home technologies. Indeed, an electric vehicle is equipped with a high-capacity battery, which can be used to store a certain amount of energy and give it back again later when required to fulfill the electricity demand and prevent an energy shortage when the main-grid power is limited for security reasons. In this context, this paper presents a comparative study between two home microgrids, in one of which the concept of vehicle-to-home is integrated to provide a case study to demonstrate the interest of this technology at the home level. The considered microgrid is composed of renewable energy resources, battery energy storage, and is connected to the main grid. As the vehicle is not available all day, in order to have consistent results, its intervention is considered in the evening, night, and early morning hours. Two case studies are carried out. In the first one, the vehicle-to-home concept is not taken into account. In this case, the system depends only on renewable resources and the energy storage system. Subsequently, the electric vehicle is considered as an additional energy storage device over a few hours. Electric vehicle integration brings an economic contribution by reducing the cost, supporting the other MG components, and relieving the main grid. Simulation results using real weather data for two cities in France, namely Brest and Toulon, show the effectiveness of the vehicle-to-home concept in terms of cost, energy self-sufficiency, and continuity of electrical service. © 2022 by the authors.

The estimation methodology extensively utilizes the vehicle registration data in conjunction with Thailand’s so-called EV30@30 campaign and GIS-based road infrastructure data. To facilitate the analysis, square grids are built to form cells representing the number of electric vehicles in any specific area of interest. This estimated number of electric vehicles is further analyzed to determine the energy consumption, calculate the recommended number of public chargers, and visualize an increase in the substation loads from those charging stations. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using the whole area of Thailand, consisting of five regions with a total area of 513,120 km2. The results show that the trucks contribute the most energy consumption while taxis rely on a lot of public chargers. The total energy consumption is about 79.4 GWh per day. A total of 12,565 public fast chargers are needed across the country to properly support daily travel, around half of them being located in the metropolitan area. © 2022 by the authors.

To facilitate vehicleto-grid strategy development, the EV model is completed with the measurement of the on-board charger efficiency and the charging control behavior upon external set-point request via IEC 61851-1. The battery model is an electro-thermal model with a dual polarization equivalent circuit electrical model coupled with a lumped thermal model with active liquid cooling. The aging trend of the EV’s 50 Ah large format pouch cell with NMC chemistry is evaluated via accelerated aging tests in the laboratory. Performance of the model is validated using laboratory pack tests, charging and driving field data. The RMSE of the cell voltage was between 18.49 mV and 67.17 mV per cell for the validation profiles. Cells stored at 100% SOC and 40 °C reached end-of-life (80% of initial capacity) after 431–589 days. The end-of-life for a cell cycled with 80% DOD around an SOC of 50% is reached after 3634 equivalent full cycles which equates to a driving distance of over 420,000 km.

maybe,,Scenarios on the Impact of Electric Vehicles on Distribution Grids,"The electricity sector has a central role in the efforts to meet climate targets. Consequently, efforts are taking place to electrify industry, heating, and transportation. The Finnish government has set the target to halve carbon dioxide traffic emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. Due to this target, the currently small proportion of electric vehicles (EVs) in Finland could expand in a manner that is difficult to forecast but could be exponential. Amid already strained investment budgets, anticipating the alternative scenarios and impacts of such a transport electrification evolution is of high importance to distribution system operators in order to optimize network planning and enhancements during the coming 15–25 years. The novelty and contribution of this paper is in utilizing a formal scenario planning process to envision what the alternative scenarios are (i.e., possible futures) for the evolution of the electric car fleet in Finland until 2040 and how these alternative scenarios could impact distribution grids. The impact analysis is performed in terms of additional energy and additional power in order to gain an understanding of the high-level impacts and investment needs. The analysis utilizes a real distribution grid in southern Finland as a case example that enables quantification. The results indicate the electric vehicles will, depending the scenario, pose an essential additional load in terms of both energy and power and that the required investment levels and investment types will be heavily dependent on the scenario. © 2022 by the authors.

maybe,,Use before You Choose: What Do EV Drivers Think about V2G after Experiencing It?,"This study aims to investigate the consumer acceptance of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) charging of electric vehicle (EV) drivers. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first V2G acceptance study that is based on actual users’ experience of V2G charging. A test set up with a V2G charge point at a solar carport was constructed at the Delft University of Technology. Seventeen participants in the study were given access to a V2G-compatible Nissan LEAF and the constructed V2G charging facilities, after which they were interviewed. Clear communication of the impacts of V2G charging cycles on EV batteries, financial compensation covering these impacts, real-time insight on the battery state-of-charge and the ability to set operational parameters through a user-friendly interface were all found to foster acceptance. The main barriers for acceptance were the uncertainty associated with battery state-of-charge, the increased need for planning charging and trips, the increased anxiety about the ability of the vehicle to reach its destination, economic and performance-related effects on the EV’s battery and the restriction of the freedom that users associated with their personal vehicles. The participants were found to be divided across high, conditional and low acceptance of V2G charging. The use of V2G charging over the trial period was found to inform their opinions: tangible factors such as range anxiety and the user interface were given more importance than abstract concepts such as lack of standards that were discussed by users without experience of V2G charging. Our study indicates that V2G charging in its current form is acceptable to a section of current EV users. The discussion provides insights on extending the relevance of our findings across other user groups and over further developments in the field. © 2022 by the authors.

Smart grids can be a cost-effective solution to overcome increases in energy demand and ensure power security. Current applications of smart grids involve a large numbers of agents (e.g., electric vehicles). Since each agent must interact with other agents when taking decisions (e.g., movement and scheduling), the computational complexity of smart grid systems increases exponentially with the number of agents. Computational tractability of planning is a significant barrier to implementation of large-scale smart grids of electric vehicles. Existing solution approaches such as mixed-integer programming and dynamic programming are not computationally efficient for high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a reformulation of a Mixed-Integer Programming model into a Decentralized Markov Decision Process model and solves it using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to address the scalability issues of large-scale smart grid systems. The Decentralized Markov Decision Process model uses centralized training and distributed execution: agents are trained using a unique actor network for each agent and a shared critic network, and then agent execute actions independently from other agents to reduce computation time. The performance of the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning model is assessed under different configurations of customers and electric vehicles, and compared to the results from deep reinforcement learning and three heuristic algorithms.

Traditional approaches see urban regeneration projects as independent processes with respect to the energy planning ones, ignoring the European Union targets to move towards the energy transition. Smart energy district approach allows to better solutions from the thermodynamic and economic point of view, and to integrate renewable energy sources, which by their nature are ‘fluctuating,’ with the energy demands using a data centre to menage the energy flows. To evaluate the benefits that a district could obtain when integrating energy planning in regeneration plans, the authors analyse the effects of a different approach to the urban design that goes beyond the traditional tasks of designing districts’ spatial aspects and propose a consistent technical analysis during the decision-making process. To do this, after defining strategic targets related to energy and resource issues, the authors implement different scenarios, evaluating the most suitable technologies that can be integrated in the area. The process of modelling and simulating the energy system hour by hour enables to identify the synergies among the energy sectors. This is done by creating models using different energy tools, as the ones used in this work.

In this article, EV charging load curves are obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation method. This article reduces the number of photovoltaic outputs and load scenarios by the K-means++ clustering algorithm to obtain a typical scenario set. Additionally, we propose a bi-level programming model for the coordinated DG and EVCSs planning problem. The maximisation of annual overall profit for the power supply company is taken as the objective function for the upper planning level. Then, each scenario is optimised at the lower level by using active management strategies. The improved harmonic particle swarm optimisation algorithm is used to solve the bi-level model. The validation results for the IEEE-33 node, PG&E-69 node test system and an actual regional 30-node distribution network show that the bi-level programming model proposed in this article can improve the planning capacity of DG and EVCSs, and effectively increase the annual overall profit of the power supply company, while improving environmental and social welfare, and reducing system power losses and voltage shifts.

Aiming at the impact of the uncertainty of electric vehicle on the power grid, an optimized dispatching method of hybrid energy storage systems based on multiobjective optimization in the scenario of tracking plan output is proposed in this paper. The predicted value of the photovoltaic power obtained by the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-back propagation (BP) neural network is used to formulate the planned output of photovoltaic power generation, and the principle component analysis algorithm is used to extract the main features affecting photovoltaic power generation to further improve the prediction accuracy of photovoltaic output power. From the perspective of the service life of electric vehicles, a two-stage optimal control method of hybrid energy storage systems based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is used to achieve energy distributions between electric vehicles and supercapacitors.

In this paper, an improved decentralized Virtual-battery based droop control with the capability of bus voltage maintenance, load power dispatch and SOC balance of the energy storage system (ESS) is proposed to ensure the autonomous and stable operation of the DC microgrid. The reference output voltage and virtual resistance in the droop control loop are altered dynamically based on the Virtual-battery model of the ESS. The coordinated control among the PV-ESS-Grid integrated system is realized through the primary Bus-Signaling control, where the reference voltages at which the control modes of the PV array and the grid are switched are designed based on the VirtualOCV of the ESS. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated in MATLAB/Simulink environment with an equivalent bus capacitance-based model where the EV charging profile is obtained from real-world charging data of a fast charging station. The merits of the control strategy including higher PV utilization, less frequent connection of the grid and more precise voltage tracking are highlighted in comparison with the conventional droop control strategy.

maybe,,Two-stage robust optimization for expansion planning of active distribution systems coupled with urban transportation networks,"Widespread utilization of electric vehicles has incurred more uncertainties and led to profound interdependencies across the power grid and transportation network. This creates an urgent demand for uncertainty modelling tools. Under this context, this paper proposes a two-stage robust optimization model for expansion planning of coupled active distribution and transportation. This model identifies the best type, location and capacity for roads, distribution lines, distributed generations, static VAR compensators, on-load tap changers, energy storage systems and charging facilities. From a system-level perspective, the steady-state pattern of the traffic flow in a transportation network is characterized by the Wardrop user equilibrium. In the active distribution system, the conic relaxation-based branch flow equations are employed, and the operating status of related devices are formulated by the linearized convex constraints. Considering the interdependency between two coupled systems, a deterministic expansion planning model is first established. Furthermore, with multiple uncertainties considered, a two-stage robust optimization model is proposed to optimize the investment and operation strategies coordinately, and thus a robust optimal solution is achieved. A two-level algorithm based on a combination of the column-and-constraint generation and outer approximation technique is developed for solving the two-stage model. The results demonstrate that the robust approach can effectively reduce the operation cost of coupled systems under the worst-case scenarios. Moreover, a comparative analysis indicates that operation costs in both systems increase linearly as the uncertainty level of traffic demand increases, while increasing that of the power load does not show an obvious change in the traffic operation cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114412,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114412,13,high
maybe,,"Robust expansion planning of a distribution system with electric vehicles, storage and renewable units","The decarbonization of energy systems passes through the transition towards low- and zero-emission vehicles and the investments in efficient technologies. To this end, an adaptive robust optimization approach is proposed for the expansion planning problem of a distribution system where expansion decisions involve the construction of renewable generating units, storage units, and charging stations for electric vehicles. The problem is formulated under the perspective of a central planner that aims at determining the expansion plan that minimizes both investment and operation costs. Both short-term variability and long-term uncertainty are considered in the proposed approach and are modeled in different ways. Short-term variability of the demand, the production of stochastic units, and the price of electricity withdrawn from or injected into the transmission system is modeled using a number of representative days corresponding to different operating conditions. Long-term uncertainty in the future peak demands, the future value of electricity exchanged with the transmission grid, and the number of electric vehicles is instead modeled through confidence bounds. A case study based on a 69-node distribution network shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the relationship between the optimal expansions decisions, the revenues from selling electricity to the electric vehicles, the degree of independence from the transmission system, and the role played by the investment budget availability. Moreover, an ex-post decarbonization analysis is conducted to evaluate the environmental impact of the adoption of electric vehicles.

In such an intelligent environment, it is possible and imperative to consider the traffic flow guidance for electric and non-electric vehicles in the urban transportation network. However, this has not yet been considered in the challenges of planning multi-energy systems. Based on these considerations, a novel optimal planning framework is proposed in the present study, that takes into account the coupling of transportation, natural gas and active distribution networks. Firstly, a novel structure of integrated energy stations is proposed, which serves as coupling components where various sources of energy can be converted, distributed, and stored. The model optimizes the investment and operational strategies of renewable energy generation, energy converters, storage devices and charging facilities in a coordinated way. To capture the impact of traffic flow, a mixed user equilibrium state was established. Thus, the route selections for non-electric vehicles and the navigations of electric vehicles to charging facilities could both be incorporated into the model. Since the proposed planning model is a mixed-integer nonlinear program problem, convex relaxation was conducted to transform the model formulations into a mixed-integer second order cone program version. Finally, four cases were designed and tested in a practical urban area. The quantitative comparison revealed that unguided traffic flow will increase the traffic costs by more than 23%. Moreover, when both charging and routing guidance are considered the energy losses will decrease by at least 5.6%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115006,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115006,13,high

We discuss the economic viability and identify potential roadblocks impeding a rapid build-up of electric mobility.We find that the installation of high-performance charging stations is highly profitable even for rather low demand, mainly due to the spread between wholesale and retail electricity prices. Congestion of regional distribution grids becomes a serious issue already for a moderate market penetration of electric vehicles.

Despite the impetus of economic and environmental benefits, the uncertainty brought in poses challenges. In this paper, we propose an integrated expansion planning framework based on a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear program. The aim is to minimize the net present value of investments considering feeder routing, substation alterations and construction while maximizing the utilization of proposed charging stations. Distributed generation and load uncertainties, recast in two-stage stochastic programming, are tackled with a scenario generation and reduction technique using a probabilistic approach with Kantorovich metrics. The final number of the scenarios are validated with an alternative clustering method. A flow-based location–allocation theory with user equilibrium traffic assignment model is exploited to site charging stations. The sizing problem is determined using continuous-time Markov chain modeling. The proposed framework is solved with a multiobjective Tchebycheff decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm and tested on a modified 54 bus distribution network and 25 transportation node system.

In this paper, we consider optimal operation of a cyber-physical system (CPS) comprising a large fleet of SAEVs and a set of charging hubs located across the transportation network and supported by the power grid. The hubs are considered to have a number of charging stations, a stand-alone battery bank for energy storage, and limited rooftop photo-voltaic (PV) generation capacity. We developed a robust mixed integer linear programming model. It considers a number of practical features of both the power and transportation systems, including day-ahead load commitment for electricity via an alternative current power flow model, real time price spikes of electricity, energy arbitrage, uncertainty in passenger demand, and balking of passengers while waiting for a ride.

Nevertheless, they bring about adversities such as uncertainty in production-load sides, augmented power loss, and voltage instability in the power system, which should be carefully addressed to increase the reliability. In this concern, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization methodology for sizing and siting of SDGs, WDGs, and capacitor banks (CBs) in the power system considering uncertainties stemmed from PEVs load demand, solar irradiance, wind speed, and the conventional load. The understudy objectives are the voltage stability index, green-house gas emissions, and the total cost. An unconventional point estimate method (PEM) is used to handle the related uncertainties, and chance-constrained programming method is deployed to deal with smooth constraints. The corresponding probability distribution functions of output variables are estimated by the maximum entropy method. Furthermore, robustness analysis is made by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed methodology is applied to a typical radial distribution network. The results show that the presence of PEV's significantly increases the load demand, which results in voltage collapse in the distribution system without the presence of distributed generations. However, the proposed probabilistic method ensures the safe operation of the distribution system with the optimal allocation of renewable distributed generations and CBs. Moreover, the results of deterministic and probabilistic cases are compared under different penetration levels of PEVs.

Given that existing infrastructure is insufficient to supply the projected energy needs, models are necessary to help decision makers plan for how to best expand the power grid to meet this need. A successful power grid expansion is one that enables charging stations to service the electric vehicle community. Thus, plans for power expansion need to be coordinated between the power grid and charging station investors. In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic programming approach that can be used to determine a power grid expansion plan that supports the energy needs, or load, from an uncertain set of electric vehicles geographically dispersed over a region. The first stage determines where to expand the power grid, and the second stage determines where to locate charging stations. The key link between the first and second stage decisions is that charging stations can only be located in areas with sufficient power supply enabled by an expanded power grid. To solve the model, we utilize a hybrid approach that combines Sample Average Approximation and an enhanced Progressive Hedging algorithm. We enhance the Progressive hedging algorithm by applying rolling horizon and variable fixing techniques. To validate the proposed model and gain key insights, we perform computational experiments using realistic data representing the Washington, DC area. Our computational results indicate the robustness of the proposed algorithm while providing a number of managerial insights to the decision makers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.07.034,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.07.034,13,high
maybe,,Optimal planning of PEV fast charging stations using an auction-based method,"In recent years, the plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have attracted a lot of attention. For integration of PEVs, proper planning of PEV charging stations is necessary. Location and size of fast charging stations (FCSs) are very important for distribution companies (DISCOs) and FCS investors. In this paper, FCS planning problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) from DISCO point of view. The proposed method is based on the dynamic auction, and a co-evolutionary genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem. FCS investors bid DISCO for energy in different locations. The DISCO, as the auctioneer, determines the location and size of FCSs based on the bids received at each location so that its profit is maximized. In the proposed model, capacitor and feeder installations are considered to satisfy the bus voltage limit and the apparent power capacity constraint of feeders, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical results. Our work shows that the proposed method can be used as a proper tool for fast FCS optimal planning in the presence of private investors of FCSs. Furthermore, in the new environment of power systems, dynamic auctions can be utilized in FCS planning. In addition, the capacitor and feeder installations can be effectively used for getting a better value of DISCO objective function. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118999,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118999,13,high
maybe,,Hierarchical planning of PEV charging facilities and DGs under transportation-power network couplings,"The increasing penetration level of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), as well as distributed generators (DGs), imposes significant challenges on power system planning. This work presents a coordinated approach for the planning of PEV charging facilities and DGs, including both the locations and the capacities, with the consideration of the transportation - power network couplings. First, the PEV charging demand is characterized by a temporal-SoC (State of Charge) analysis, and the DG generation uncertainties are modeled by K-means clustering using historical data. The M/M/s/N queuing model is used to formulate the dynamics of charging stations and then obtain the optimal station capacity, including the number of chargers and waiting spaces. Furthermore, the placement of charging stations is optimized by the Floyd Algorithm to minimize the total distance to obtain charging service. Finally, the sitting and sizing of DGs are optimized over multiple objectives, including active power losses, reactive power losses, and voltage deviation. The solution is evaluated through a case study of the IEEE 53-bus test feeder coupled with a 25-node transportation network. It is shown that the proposed solution enables the active and reactive power losses as well as the voltage deviation to be reduced by 37.6%, 44.3%, and 33.6%, respectively, after the optimal integration of PEV charging stations and DGs. The scalability and effectiveness of the solution are further validated in an IEEE 123-bus test feeder coupled with the same transportation network, and the result confirms the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed solution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.renene.2019.12.097,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2019.12.097,13,high

maybe,,Techno-economic evaluation of PEVs energy storage capability in wind distributed generations planning,"Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can be used for renewable energy dispatching in both operation and planning of distribution networks. In this paper, wind distributed generations (WDGs) are planned based on vehicle to grid (V2G) operation mode of PEVs. The optimal long-term planning is based on optimal short-term scheduling considering all related uncertainties. A comprehensive model of the batteries degradation is considered in the objective function. A two-layer optimization procedure is proposed in which the optimal location and capacity of WDGs are determined in first layer, while optimal charge and/or discharge of PEVs are scheduled in the second layer, subject to technical constraints. The numerical results delineate the capability of PEVs in V2G operation mode for wind energy dispatching in WDGs planning. The simulation results show the storage capability of PEVs will increase by their number growing. Therefore, the operation and planning costs of WDGs will be reduced if the PEVs penetration to be high. The capacity of installed WDGs in smart charging scenario is less than uncoordinated charging scenario as the PEVs properly dispatch WDGs in smart charging strategy. Moreover, the results show that the PEVs battery degradation cost limit the participation rate of PEVs in WDGs dispatching. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.scs.2020.102117,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2020.102117,13,high
maybe,,Multi-objective optimal planning of wind distributed generation considering uncertainty and different penetration level of plug-in electric vehicles,"Despite the many challenges related to the simultaneous surge in wind-based distributed generation (WDGs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in modern power systems, they will be a great help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nonetheless, the associated problems such as uncertainty in production-load sides, voltage instability, and power loss augmentation should be reanalyzed. These predicaments can be dealt to some extent with proper siting and sizing of WDGs together with capacitor banks (CBs) as a conventional voltage regulator and reactive power compensator. However, the sizing and siting problem consists of various objectives, such as voltage stability improvement, emission reduction, and cost reduction. It is a great challenge to optimize these contradictory objectives altogether. Hence, to overcome all these struggles, this paper proposes a tri-objective optimization formulation for optimal planning of WDGs and CBs in the power system, considering uncertainties derived from PEVs’ load demand, wind speed, and conventional load. The objectives to be optimized are, namely, voltage stability index, total cost, and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, this study assimilates an unaccustomed type of point estimate method (PEM) into strength Pareto multi-objective differential evolution algorithm, which is not only computationally light but also reasonably accurate. Moreover, chance-constrained programming is integrated into the PEM using a maximum entropy method to deal with smooth constraints. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated by the Monte-Carlo simulation. Eventually, the proposed algorithm is compared with other standard multi-objective metaheuristic optimization algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.scs.2020.102401,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2020.102401,13,high
maybe,,Conjugate active and reactive power management in a smart distribution network through electric vehicles: A mixed integer-linear programming model,"Electrical Vehicles (EVs) have a growing penetration rate in many countries aimed at the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and declining environmental issues. The high penetration rate of EVs, as new electrical energy demands, can cause operational problems for distribution networks. Therefore, designing and implementation of monitoring and management mechanisms for EVs charging is a necessity. EVs are equipped with power electronic-based chargers, bringing them a high degree of flexibility in conjugate active and reactive power control. This capability can be employed not only to reduce the adverse impacts of the high penetration rate of EVs on distribution networks operation but also to support the active and reactive management in distribution networks. In this paper, to employ EVs conjugate active and reactive power control capability, a model for central active and reactive power management in a smart distribution network is proposed. The proposed model is an optimization problem in which the objective function consists of two terms, namely, “minimizing the cost of energy” and “improving the voltage profile”, over the operation planning horizon. The constraints of the optimization problem include distribution network operation constraints and charging and discharging constraints related to the EVs batteries and chargers. This problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem and is implemented on the 33-bus, 69-bus, and 133-bus distribution networks. The results show that the proposed model can obtain the lowest energy cost and energy loss and the best operational voltage profile in a completely acceptable calculation time. Moreover, by using the proposed model, supplying the required energy for EVs during their plugin time interval is guaranteed and, increasing the penetration rate of EVs into the network is facilitated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.segan.2020.100344,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2020.100344,13,high
maybe,,Hydrogen refueling station networks for heavy-duty vehicles in future power systems,"A potential solution to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transport sector is to use alternatively fueled vehicles (AFV). Heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) emit a large share of GHG emissions in the transport sector and are therefore the subject of growing attention from global regulators. Fuel cell and green hydrogen technologies are a promising option to decarbonize HDVs, as their fast refueling and long vehicle ranges are consistent with current logistic operational requirements. Moreover, the application of green hydrogen in transport could enable more effective integration of renewable energies (RE) across different energy sectors. This paper explores the interplay between HDV Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) that produce hydrogen locally and the power system by combining an infrastructure location planning model and an electricity system optimization model that takes grid expansion options into account. Two scenarios – one sizing refueling stations to support the power system and one sizing them independently of it – are assessed regarding their impacts on the total annual electricity system costs, regional RE integration and the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The impacts are calculated based on locational marginal pricing for 2050. Depending on the integration scenario, we find average LCOH of between 4.83 euro/kg and 5.36 euro/kg, for which nodal electricity prices are the main determining factor as well as a strong difference in LCOH between north and south Germany. Adding HDV-HRS incurs power transmission expansion as well as higher power supply costs as the total power demand increases. From a system perspective, investing in HDV-HRS in symbiosis with the power system rather than independently promises cost savings of around seven billion euros per annum. We therefore conclude that the co-optimization of multiple energy sectors is important for investment planning and has the potential to exploit synergies. © 2020 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102358,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102358,13,high

Coordinated distributed energy resources and PEV charging can mitigate the impact of this shift. This study presents an analysis of photovoltaic (PV) solar parking lots that address this benefit. Real-world charging data, solar data, and electricity tariffs are used to determine the microgrid system that minimises the cost of retrofitting an existing parking lot with PV and PEV infrastructure coupled. The result is a load scheduling algorithm that takes into account tariffs and insolation to reduce costs while ensuring customer satisfaction. The techno-economic feasibility of PV infrastructure in the microgrid is determined by minimising the net present cost (NPC) in two case studies: Victoria, BC, and Los Angeles, CA. Relatively low solar irradiation and electricity prices make it economically infeasible to install solar panels in Victoria even though the operational costs are reduced by 11\%. In Los Angeles, high time-of-use prices, together with abundant solar radiation, make PV retrofitting economically feasible with any array capacity. At the current solar infrastructure price, coordinated charging in this region yields 8-16\% savings on NPC and smaller feeder size requirements with greater load growth opportunities.",10.1049/iet-esi.2019.0136,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1049/iet-esi.2019.0136,13,high

The model considers investment, production and maintenance cost and identifies the substations and feeders to be built, reinforced or replaced. Owing to the increasing penetration of PEVs into the distribution network, traditional strategies to expand the network have to be updated to cope with the new uncertainties incurred by the PEVs integration. In this regard, a two-stage scenario-based strategy is presented, in which the uncertainties related to the PEVs are modelled via stochastic optimisation using Monte Carlo simulation. In the first stage, the binary decision variables (here and now decision variables) are determined, whereas in the second stage, the optimal production of substations and optimal charging of PEVs (wait and see decision variables) are identified in a day-ahead electricity market. Moreover, the daily electricity price and load volatilities have also been taken into account.

This is due to the intermittent generation of RESs and uncertain loads of PEVs, both of which necessitate enhancing the flexibility requirements at the distribution level so as to accommodate the high penetration of these clean technologies in the future. To address such issues, this study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming-based expansion planning model for DNs considering the impact of high RES and PEV penetration, the associated uncertainties, and providing flexibility requirements at the distribution level. In this respect, the spherical simplex unscented transformation, an analytical uncertainty modelling method, is implemented in the planning model to take into account the forecasting errors of the uncertain green technologies. Also, in order to estimate the electric vehicle parking lot demand at each load node of the network, a new approach for PEV-charging model is suggested.

This requires an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs). Such an allocation strategy should provide acceptable charging services at different deployment stages while meeting financial and technical constraints. As new CSs get allocated, distributed generation (DG) units need to be also dynamically allocated in both space and time to compensate for the increment in the loads due to the EV charging requests. Unfortunately, existing power grid models are not suitable to reflect such spatio-temporal evolution, and hence, new models need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal expanding power grid model based on stochastic geometry. Using this flexible model, we perform a dynamic joint allocation of EV CSs and DG units based on a constrained Markov decision process. The proposed dynamic allocation strategy accounts for charging coordination mechanism within each CS, which in turn allows for maximal usage of deployed chargers.

maybe,,Scenario Forecasting of Residential Load Profiles,"Load forecasting is an integral part of power system operations and planning. Due to rising penetrations of rooftop PV, electric vehicles and demand response programs, forecasting the load of individual and a small group of households is becoming increasingly important. Forecasting the load accurately, however, is considerably more difficult when only a few households are included. A way to mitigate this challenge is to provide a set of scenarios instead of one point forecast, so an operator or utility can consider the full range of behaviors. This paper proposes a novel scenario forecasting approach for residential load using flow-based conditional generative models. Compared to existing scenario forecasting methods, our approach can generate scenarios that are not only able to infer possible future realizations of residential load from the observed historical data but also realistic enough to cover a wide range of behaviors. Particularly, the flow-based models utilize a flow of reversible transformations to maximize the value of conditional density function of future load given the past observations. In order to better capture the complex temporal dependency of the forecasted future load, we extend the structure design for the reversible transformations in flow-based conditional generative models by strengthening the coupling between the output and the conditioning input.

In particular, the proposed framework accounts for the link between the charging QoS and the power distribution network (PDN) capability. Towards this end, we firstly optimize charging facility sizes to achieve a targeted QoS level. Then, we minimize the integration cost for the PDN by attaining the most cost-effective allocation of the energy storage systems (ESSs) and/or upgrading the PDN substation and feeders. Additionally, we capture the correlation between the occupation levels of neighboring charging facilities and the blocked PEV user behaviors. We model the EVCI as a queuing network with finite capacity, and utilize the non-stationary queuing models to study the temporal variability of the PEV charging demand. A network of charging facilities is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",10.1109/OJVT.2020.2979820,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/ojvt.2020.2979820,13,high
maybe,,Decentralized Hierarchical Planning of PEVs Based on Mean-Field Reverse Stackelberg Game,"In the reverse Stackelberg mechanism, by considering a decision function for the leader rather than a decision value in the conventional Stackelberg game, the leader can explore a wider decision space. This flexibility can result in realizing the globally optimal solution of the leader's objective function, while controlling the reaction function of the followers, simultaneously. We consider an aggregator who purchases energy from the wholesale energy market. The aggregator acts as the leader for a group of plugged in electric vehicles (PEVs) and determines the price of energy versus consumption at each hour a day as its decision function. In the followers level, since the optimal charging strategies of the PEVs are coupled through the electricity price, the PEVs in a group are considered to cooperate in finding their Nash-Pareto-optimal charging strategy, by minimizing a social cost function. For a large number of PEVs, the cooperative cost minimization of PEVs can be modeled as a cooperative mean-field (MF) game. We propose a decentralized MF optimal control algorithm and prove that the algorithm converges to leader-follower MF \varepsilon _{N}-Nash equilibrium point of the game. Furthermore, a decentralized reverse Stackelberg algorithm is implemented to achieve the optimal linear price function of the leader. Simulation results and comparison with benchmark methods are performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-The effect of a large population of PEVs on the power grid such as overload and voltage drop is inevitable. Motivated by this, there are many research articles which propose different centralized and decentralized charging coordination solutions to address this problem. The core idea in the most of literature is: 'How to IMPLEMENT a demand response (DR) program appropriately for charging coordination problem to avoid high peak load?' However, none of them propose a practical algorithm on 'How to DESIGN a DR optimally by having limited information from the clients?' We propose a bilevel optimization algorithm to both design a DR program (i.e., price function) and also implement DR program to flatten the demand curve, accordingly. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the information structure of the problem is close to reality. There is no information exchange among the clients and also the utility company does not need to know the private information of the clients. The Utility Company only knows the charging profile of the PEVs in each day and broadcasts the price signal to the clients for the next day.

maybe,,Robust Scheduling of Electric Vehicle Charging in LV Distribution Networks Under Uncertainty,"Rapid increase in the number of electric vehicles will likely deteriorate voltage profiles and overload distribution networks. Controlling the charging schedule of electric vehicles in a coordinated manner provides a potential solution to mitigate the issues and could defer reinforcement of network infrastructure. This work presents a method for robust, cost-minimizing, day-ahead scheduling of overnight charging of electric vehicles in low voltage networks in a stochastic environment with minimal real-time adaptation. To reduce the computational complexity, a linear power flow approximation is utilized. The stochastic environment captures multiple uncertainties arising from the mobility behavior including stochastic daily trip distances, arrival and departure times. Knowledge about the probability distributions of these parameters is used to hedge risks regarding the cost of charging, network overloading, voltage violation, and charging reliability. The results on a test network provide an insight into the impact of uncertainty and the effectiveness of addressing aspects of risk during optimization.

By increasing EVs in cities, it has appeared some new players such as electric vehicles (EVs) owners and electric vehicle parking lots (EVPLs) owners for DNP. In this article, we conduct a new study on the coupled dynamic expansion problem of EVPLs placement and distribution networks. To reach this goal, at first, EVs driving and charging/discharging behavior as some influential factors is modeled using an efficient probabilistic algorithm. An analytical model is then introduced to estimate the number of EVs in EVPLs at different times. To find out the optimal place for installing EVPLs and distribution network reinforcement, a multiobjective (MO) optimization model is formulated considering the main requirements of EVs users, EVPLs owners, and distribution system operators. A linear model is also derived for the energy monument of EVs in EVPLs and residential charging stations to be used in the mentioned MO expansion problem. Numerical results with various cases are presented to illustrate the main advantages of the proposed coupled expansion model.

Other uncertain parameters are related with the behavior of the PEV owners, for instance, the arrival and departure times to home, and the state of charge of the PEV when it is plugged to the grid. These parameters are modeled by using probability density functions, to then generate random numbers and perform Monte Carlo simulations. Each Monte Carlo simulation corresponds to the calculation of a power-flow in the analyzed network. The proposed methodology is tested on the IEEE 33-bus test distribution network, with the purpose of quantifying the influence of diversity of PEVs. The analysis is performed, specifically, for identify those transformers and lines that could be overloaded. Two scenarios of PEV penetration by 2025 and 2030 were assessed, i.e., considering that 10 and 30 percent of the residential customers will have at least one PEV, respectively.

We present an enhanced AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) model that estimates dynamic Distribution nodal Location Marginal Costs (DLMCs) encompassing transformer degradation as a short-run network variable cost. We decompose real/reactive power DLMCs into additive marginal cost components representing respectively the costs of real/reactive power transactions at the T&D interface, real/reactive power marginal losses, voltage and ampacity congestion, and transformer degradation, capturing intertemporal coupling. Decomposition is useful in identifying sources of marginal costs and facilitating the employment of distributed AC OPF algorithms. DLMCs convey sufficient information to represent the benefit of shifting real/reactive power across time and achieve optimal Distribution Network and DER operation.

This will result in more reliability stress and security constraints on existing and planned electricity generation and transmission assets, at a time utilities are facing pressure to do more with less. This paper proposes to address grid limitations, which may constrain large-scale PEV integration in future grids, using a novel planning model for transmission and generation expansions under uncertainties, based on adaptive robust optimization via scenario-based ambiguity sets. The new model can achieve decarbonization of both the electricity and transportation sectors economically, while meeting the electric grid reliability requirements. It also incorporates PEV charging controls over the planning horizon aiming at facilitating the maximum PEV penetration in the used test cases, more economically and realistically, considering current technology trends.

Therefore, this article presents a look-ahead scheduling model for EVs to offer a load curtailment service in a distribution network, with the aim of smoothing out the power fluctuations caused by distributed renewable energy sources. An equivalent aggregation method that is not sensitive to heterogeneous private parameters is used to extract the overall dynamic power regulation characteristics of the EV population, while a decomposition model ensures the completion of the regulation task. Besides, in the scheduling model, the variable baselines are dynamically refreshed to capture the load rebound effects caused by load curtailment, allowing more accurate regulation plans to be obtained.

However, in those regions where coal is a dominating power generation fuel source, different opinions about whether EVs can help emission reduction exist. In other words, whether EVs can help emission reduction depends on the energy system configuration and the power generation mix. To achieve the overall emission reduction in both systems, a collaborative planning strategy for electricity and transportation systems is proposed. In the electricity distribution network, the renewable energy source is planned to cope with future demand growth due to the increasing use of EVs. In the transportation network, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are introduced to realize the coordinated development of different types of vehicles. The location of the hydrogen refueling stations can be planned, and the penetration ratio of internal combustion vehicles, EVs, and FCVs is optimized. The proposed planning model is verified on the 46-bus electricity distribution network and the 21-bus transportation network.

The focuses were placed on analyzing the daily usage occupancy variability, daily energy consumption variability, and station-level usage variability. Compared with the traditional discrete-based analysis models, the proposed FDA modeling approach had unique advantages in preserving the smooth function behavior of the data, bringing more flexibility in the modeling process with little required assumptions or background knowledge on independent variables, as well as the capability of handling time series data with different lengths or sizes. In addition to the patterns revealed in the EV charging station’s occupancy and energy consumption, the differences between EV driver’s charging time and parking time were analyzed and called for the needs for parking regulation and enforcement. The different usage patterns observed at charging stations located on different land-use types were also analyzed. © © 2020 Chenxi Chen et al.

The system power loss and node voltage excursion can be effectively reduced, by taking measures of time-of-use (TOU) price mechanism bonded with the reactive compensation of energy storage devices. Firstly, the coordinate charging/discharging load model for EV has been established, to obtain a narrowed gap between load peak and valley. Next, a multi-objective optimization model of the distribution grid is also defined, and the active power loss and node voltage fluctuation are chosen to be the objective function. For improving the efficiency of optimization process, an advanced genetic algorithm associated with elite preservation policy is used. Finally, reactive compensation capacity supplied by capacitor banks is dynamically determined according to the varying building loads. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on the IEEE 33-node test case, and the simulation results show that the power supply pressure can be obviously relieved by introducing the coordinated charging/discharging behavior of EV; in the meantime, via reasonable planning of the compensation capacitor, the remarkably lower active power loss and voltage excursion can be realized, ensuring the safe and economical operation of the distribution system.",10.1186/s41601-020-0154-0,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1186/s41601-020-0154-0,13,high

A new conceptual design of mobile battery energy storage systems has been proposed in recent studies to reduce the curtailment of renewable energy while limiting the public costs of battery energy storage systems.

maybe,,Assessment and mitigation of electric vehicle charging demand impact to transformer aging for an apartment complex,"Due to the increasing use of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the effect of the EV charging power demand on the reliability of the power system infrastructure needs to be addressed. In apartment complexes, which have emerged as a common residential type in metropolitan areas and highly populated districts, high charging demand could result in substantial stress to distribution networks. In this work, the effect of EV charging power demand in an apartment complex on the aging of the Distribution Transformer (DT) is studied. A methodology based on the stochastic characterization of vehicle usage profiles and user charging patterns is developed to obtain realistic EV charging demand profiles. Based on the modeled EV charging profile and the transformer thermal model, the effect of different EV penetration ratios on DT aging for an apartment complex in the Republic of Korea is studied. Results for an EV penetration ratio of up to 30% indicated that DT aging could be accelerated by up to 40%, compared to the case without EV charging. To mitigate this accelerated DT aging caused by EV charging, the effectiveness of two integration approaches of Photovoltaic (PV) sources was studied. Based on a case study that included a realistic PV generation profile, it was demonstrated that a significant contribution to DT reliability could be achieved via the operation of PV sources. A more apparent contribution of PV integration was observed with an energy storage installation at higher EV penetration ratios. At an EV penetration ratio of 30%, a maximum decrease of 41.8% in the loss-of-life probability of the DT was achieved. The effects of different PV integration approaches and power management details on DT aging were also studied. The results demonstrate that the EV charging demand could introduce a significant level of stress to DTs and that this impact can be effectively mitigated by installing PV sources. These observations are expected to contribute toward the effective planning of power system infrastructures that support the design of sustainable cities with the widespread use of EVs. © 2020 by the authors.

maybe,,Evaluation of grid capacities for integrating future E‐Mobility and heat pumps into low‐voltage grids,"While an area‐wide implementation of electric vehicles (EVs) and electric heat pumps (HPs) will contribute to a decarbonization of the energy system, they represent new challenges for existing low‐voltage (LV) power grids. Hence, this study investigates potential grid congestions on the basis of three contrasting load approaches applied to four different grid regions. Within the three load approaches, temporal characteristics of various grid customer classes (EVs, HPs, households etc.) are derived from highly resolved realistic load profiles. In accordance with classic grid planning, firstly a static load approach is analyzed by applying the modeled coincidence for each consumer class individually. Secondly, this static approach is modified by including combined coincidence factors, taking temporal consumer class interactions into account. Finally, both static load approaches are compared with detailed annual time series analyses by means of load flow simulations using real‐life LV grid data. The evaluation of inadmissible voltage characteristics and thermal congestions identifies future grid extension needs depending on the considered grid region. In addition, the variation of the applied load approach highlights the need to consider consumer-specific temporal behavior. In fact, by neglecting temporal interactions between conventional and future grid customers, the classic grid planning approach overestimates future grid extension needs. To counteract an oversizing of future grid structures, this paper presents a combined consideration of EVs' and HPs' coincidence as well as resulting grid consequences on the LV level. © 2020 by the authors.

maybe,,A blockchain-based configuration for balancing the electricity grid with distributed assets,"This paper explores a future perspective to foster the provision of balancing services to the electricity grid by distributed assets. One recent test case, initiated by the Dutch Transmission System Operator (TSO), was to operate an Electric Vehicle (EV) fleet on the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) market, which entails fast and automated reserves. To achieve that in a decentralised, automated and transparent manner, the role of blockchain technology for this specific application is explored. We propose a novel configuration that can serve as a basis for deploying distributed assets for aFRR markets using blockchain or any alternative Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Automation can be achieved via the deployment of smart contracts, which also results in transparency in the system. The blockchain configurations are designed for three phases in the aFRR market, namely: (i) Operational planning and scheduling by a balancing service provider (i.e., formulation and submission of aFRR bid), (ii) Real-time operations (i.e., activation and measurements), and (iii) Verification and settlement (i.e., imbalance correction and financial settlement). The paper concludes that the scalability of distributed assets that can participate in the system, combined with the large transaction times and energy consumption of some consensus mechanisms, could put limitations on the proposed architecture. Future research should address benchmarking studies of other alternatives (e.g., DLTs, such as the ones based on directed acyclic graphs, and non-DLT solutions) with the proposed blockchain solution. © 2020, MDPI AG.

maybe,,Multi-time Scale Energy Management Strategy of Aggregator Characterized by Photovoltaic Generation and Electric Vehicles,"The increasing number of photovoltaic (PV) generation and electric vehicles (EVs) on the load side has necessitated an aggregator (Agg) in power system operation. In this paper, an Agg is used to manage the energy profiles of PV generation and EVs. However, the daily management of the Agg is challenged by uncertain PV fluctuations. To address this problem, a robust multi-time scale energy management strategy for the Agg is proposed. In a day-ahead phase, robust optimization is developed to determine the power schedule. In a real-time phase, a rolling horizon-based convex optimization model is established to track the day-ahead power schedule based on the flexibilities of the EVs. A case study indicates a good scheduling performance under an uncertain PV output. Through the convexification, the solving efficiency of the real-time operation model is improved, and the over-charging and over-discharging problems of EVs can be suppressed to a certain extent. Moreover, the power deviation between day-ahead and real-time scheduling is controllable when the EV dispatching capacity is sufficient. The strategy can ensure the flexibility of the Agg for real-time operation.",10.35833/MPCE.2019.000464,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.35833/mpce.2019.000464,13,high
maybe,,Assessing electric vehicle CO2 emissions in the Portuguese power system using a marginal generation approach,"In this work the electric vehicle (EV) specific CO<inf>2</inf> emissions resulting from the EV integration on the Portuguese power system are analysed, considering a large set of scenarios combining the system renewable capacity versus EV share, under a night charge scenario. For this purpose, a unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) is applied to the power units scheduling. The optimization procedure is implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) and performs the dispatch of the thermal and hydro units, in order to minimize the operation costs. The model is applied to an entire year of operation in an hourly basis using a marginal methodology. According to the results obtained, for the scenarios considered, the EV specific CO<inf>2</inf> emissions range from 57 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km, for high wind capacity and low EV penetration, to 129 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km, for low wind capacity and low EV penetration. However, if a controlled charge strategy, aiming the minimizing of generation costs, is considered, the range of results is wider, varying from 26 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km, for high wind capacity and low EV penetration, to 133 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km for low wind capacity and low EV penetration. From the results, it can be concluded that, with the current wind capacity of the Portuguese system, and with a night charge strategy, the impact of the EV in terms of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions is not beneficial when compared to the 95 g CO<inf>2</inf>/km target, for penetrations lower than 1 million vehicles, but if a controlled charge is considered, it would be not beneficial for a EV penetration of 180 thousand vehicles. Results also show that EVs can be integrated in an environmental beneficial way, if increasing EV penetrations are combined with an increase in the installed wind capacity. © 2020, Aalborg University press.

maybe,,Flexible grid-based electrolysis hydrogen production for fuel cell vehicles reduces costs and greenhouse gas emissions,"Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) have been proposed as an option for lowering carbon dioxide (CO2) and pollutants emissions from the transportation sector, when implemented in combination with green hydrogen production methods such as water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity. FCEVs also have the added advantages of high specific energy density and rapid refueling, two important challenges that battery electric vehicles have not yet fully overcome. Moreover, flexible operation of electrolysis could support the grid and lower electricity costs. In this paper, we simulate time-varying FCEV hydrogen refueling demand for light, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles met using electrolysis systems distributed throughout the Western U.S. power system. We find that by oversizing electrolyzers the resulting load flexibility results in different hydrogen generation temporal profiles, average electricity costs, renewable curtailment levels, and CO2 emissions. Our results indicate that increasing hydrogen production flexibility lowers hydrogen and electricity generation cost and CO2 emissions, but there is a tradeoff between lowering operational cost and increasing electrolyzer capital cost, yielding a minimum total system cost at a size corresponding to between 80% and 90% annual capacity factor assuming a future electrolyzer cost of $300/kW.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115651,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115651,13,high
maybe,,Quantifying power system flexibility provision,"In power systems, flexibility can be defined as the ability to cope with variability and uncertainty in generation and demand. The ongoing energy transition is affecting how much flexibility is required, but also who should provide it: some existing solutions are being phased out, while new solutions’ entire business models are based on providing flexibility (e.g. storage or demand response). With the intention of condensing information and rationalising debates, a significant number of methods have been proposed to quantify various facets of flexibility; this paper reviews and classifies them depending on the question they attempt to address. We propose a pair of novel tools to quantify a comparatively unexplored aspect of flexibility: who is providing it. These frequency spectrum analysis based tools separately quantify flexibility provision on the annual, weekly and daily timescales. The tools’ effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated through several example applications, analysing both historical and prospective power systems, in several geographical locations with contrasting characteristics. The proposed tools are of particular value to the capacity expansion planner, allowing them to quantify changes in flexibility provision as new solutions are introduced, or as carbon taxes, generation and interconnector capacities evolve.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115852,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115852,13,high
maybe,,Probabilistic planning of electric vehicles charging stations in an integrated electricity-transport system,"One of the most important aspects of the development of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the optimal sizing and allocation of charging stations. Due to the interactions between the electricity and transportation systems, the key features of these systems (such as traffic network characteristics, charging demands and power system constraints) should be taken into account for the optimal planning. This paper addressed the optimal sizing and allocation of the fast-charging stations in a distribution network. The traffic flow of EVs is modeled using the User Equilibrium-based Traffic Assignment Model (UETAM). Moreover, a stochastic framework is developed based on the Queuing Theory (QT) to model the load levels (EVs’ charging demand). The objective function of the problem is to minimize the annual investment cost, as well as the energy losses that are optimized through chance-constrained programming. The probabilistic aspects of the proposed problem are modeled by using the point estimation method and Gram-Charlier expansion. Furthermore, the probabilistic dominance criteria are employed in order to compare the uncertain alternatives.

maybe,,Multi-objective optimal short-term planning of renewable distributed generations and capacitor banks in power system considering different uncertainties including plug-in electric vehicles,"The increasing penetration of solar distributed generations (SDGs) and wind distributed generations (WDGs) together with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will lead to a promising amount of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, they bring about adversities such as uncertainty in production-load sides, augmented power loss, and voltage instability in the power system, which should be carefully addressed to increase the reliability. In this concern, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization methodology for sizing and siting of SDGs, WDGs, and capacitor banks (CBs) in the power system considering uncertainties stemmed from PEVs load demand, solar irradiance, wind speed, and the conventional load. The understudy objectives are the voltage stability index, green-house gas emissions, and the total cost. An unconventional point estimate method (PEM) is used to handle the related uncertainties, and chance-constrained programming method is deployed to deal with smooth constraints. The corresponding probability distribution functions of output variables are estimated by the maximum entropy method. Furthermore, robustness analysis is made by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed methodology is applied to a typical radial distribution network. The results show that the presence of PEV’s significantly increases the load demand, which results in voltage collapse in the distribution system without the presence of distributed generations. However, the proposed probabilistic method ensures the safe operation of the distribution system with the optimal allocation of renewable distributed generations and CBs. Moreover, the results of deterministic and probabilistic cases are compared under different penetration levels of PEVs.

maybe,,Optimal planning of PEV fast charging stations using an auction-based method,"In recent years, the plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have attracted a lot of attention. For integration of PEVs, proper planning of PEV charging stations is necessary. Location and size of fast charging stations (FCSs) are very important for distribution companies (DISCOs) and FCS investors. In this paper, FCS planning problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) from DISCO point of view. The proposed method is based on the dynamic auction, and a co-evolutionary genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem. FCS investors bid DISCO for energy in different locations. The DISCO, as the auctioneer, determines the location and size of FCSs based on the bids received at each location so that its profit is maximized. In the proposed model, capacitor and feeder installations are considered to satisfy the bus voltage limit and the apparent power capacity constraint of feeders, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical results. Our work shows that the proposed method can be used as a proper tool for fast FCS optimal planning in the presence of private investors of FCSs. Furthermore, in the new environment of power systems, dynamic auctions can be utilized in FCS planning. In addition, the capacitor and feeder installations can be effectively used for getting a better value of DISCO objective function.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118999,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118999,13,high
maybe,,Hierarchical planning of PEV charging facilities and DGs under transportation-power network couplings,"The increasing penetration level of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), as well as distributed generators (DGs), imposes significant challenges on power system planning. This work presents a coordinated approach for the planning of PEV charging facilities and DGs, including both the locations and the capacities, with the consideration of the transportation - power network couplings. First, the PEV charging demand is characterized by a temporal-SoC (State of Charge) analysis, and the DG generation uncertainties are modeled by K-means clustering using historical data. The M/M/s/N queuing model is used to formulate the dynamics of charging stations and then obtain the optimal station capacity, including the number of chargers and waiting spaces. Furthermore, the placement of charging stations is optimized by the Floyd Algorithm to minimize the total distance to obtain charging service. Finally, the sitting and sizing of DGs are optimized over multiple objectives, including active power losses, reactive power losses, and voltage deviation. The solution is evaluated through a case study of the IEEE 53-bus test feeder coupled with a 25-node transportation network. It is shown that the proposed solution enables the active and reactive power losses as well as the voltage deviation to be reduced by 37.6%, 44.3%, and 33.6%, respectively, after the optimal integration of PEV charging stations and DGs. The scalability and effectiveness of the solution are further validated in an IEEE 123-bus test feeder coupled with the same transportation network, and the result confirms the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed solution.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.12.097,2020,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.12.097,13,high

maybe,,Efficient techno-economic modelling of smart parking lots within the electricity distribution networks,"The rapid uptake of electric vehicles is transforming public and workplace car parks into large, highly flexible electrical loads whose behaviour must be co-optimised with distribution network operation. Yet explicitly modelling every plugged-in vehicle makes even modest-sized studies computationally prohibitive and masks the economic tension between parking-lot owners and network operators. This paper proposes a cost-driven optimisation framework that converts a smart parking lot into an equivalent energy storage system, retaining hourly accuracy while collapsing thousands of binary charging decisions into a handful of continuous variables, allowing for the co-optimisation of the smart parking lot and the electricity distribution network. In the network, non-linear AC power-flow limits are convexified with second-order cone programming. At the same time, the discrete operating states of the SPL are handled by mixed-integer linear programming. To capture the multi-actor reality, separate objective functions represent (i) the distribution system operator's operating cost and (ii) the smart parking lot owner's profit, allowing for realistic price-signal interactions to emerge without resorting to heavyweight bi-level or game-theoretic solvers. The framework is first benchmarked on the classical IEEE 33-bus distribution network, augmented with photovoltaic, wind turbine, and conventional energy storage resources, and then stress-tested on a real 83-bus primary network from the UK, fed with arrival/departure and state-ofcharge data for 200 real electric vehicles from the My Electric Avenue project. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model confirms that modelling smart parking lots as energy storage system equivalents unlocks their value to modern distribution networks while keeping optimisation complexity manageable.

Tri-CCSF is designed to deliver an integrated optimization of economic charging navigation and scheduling, considering the implications of charging load on the main power grid (MPG) and the inherent uncertainties associated with renewable energy (RE). The first level utilizes aggregated EV charging flexibility to minimize power exchange between CS and MPG.

Furthermore, the proximal policy optimization-alternating direction method of multipliers (PPO-ADMMs) algorithm is proposed to enhance the solution efficiency of the quadratic programming (QP) problem.

maybe,,A novel multi-objective optimization based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach for microgrid resources planning,"Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approaches are at the forefront of contemporary research in optimum electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling challenges. These techniques involve multiple agents that respond to a dynamic simulation environment to strategically integrate EV charging stations (EVCSs) on microgrids by incorporating the constraints posed by stochastic trip durations. In addition, recent research works have demonstrated that planning frameworks based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) techniques are suitable for the efficient functioning of microgrids comprising renewable energy sources (RESs) and battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Even though MADRL techniques have been used to solve the optimum EV charging scheduling challenges and MOO frameworks have been developed to determine the optimal RES-BESS allocation, the potential of merging MADRL and MOO is yet to be explored. Therefore, this research provides an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of combined MOO-MADRL dynamics and their computational efficacy. In this context, this work presents a novel Multi-objective Artificial Vultures Optimization Algorithm based on Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MOAVOA-MADDPG) planning framework for allocating RESs, BESSs, and EVCSs on microgrids. The objective function is formulated to optimize the network power losses, total installation and operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and system voltage stability. Moreover, the proposed framework incorporates the sporadic nature of RES systems and intends to improve the state of charge (SOC) of the EVs present in the network. The presented approach is validated using practical weather data and EV commuting behavior on the modified IEEE 33 bus network, two practical distribution feeders in Bangladesh, and the Turkish 141 bus network. According to the findings, the MOAVOA-MADDPG framework effectively accommodated the financial, technical, and environmental considerations with improved average SOC of the vehicles. Furthermore, statistical analysis, spacing, convergence, and hyper-volume metrics are employed to compare the suggested MOAVOA-MADDPG framework with five contemporary techniques.

First, demand-side adjustment, which involves adjusting the power of the ship's electric propulsion motors and flexible service loads, is integrated into the energy management problem. Second, HP3O algorithm is employed to obtain both continuous and discrete variables simultaneously. It utilizes a continuous actor network to obtain continuous variables, such as the generator's power and ship cruising speed, while employing a discrete actor network to determine discrete variables, i.e., the on/off status of the generators. Third, to handle complex constraints reasonably, the energy management problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and an action mask mechanism is also integrated into the energy management framework to make agent's actions more reliable.

maybe,,Chance-constrained scheduling considering frequency support from electric vehicles under multiple uncertainties,"With the share of renewable generation increasing, considerable synchronous generators have been displaced. This trend results in the decline of system inertia and thus raises the frequency secure issue. Concurrently, electric vehicles (EVs) proliferate. Numerous EVs hold a huge potential of frequency regulation in case of contingency as EVs are able to achieve primary frequency responses (PFRs) via vehicle to grid chargers. However, the value of frequency responses from aggregated EVs has not fully exploited. This paper, proposes a chance constrained scheduling model incorporating the ability of PFRs from aggregated EVs. The proposed model characterizes uncertainties associated PFR capacities from aggregated EVs and wind power forecast errors by the Wasserstein-metric ambiguity sets, which do not rely on distributional assumption, and then formulates uncertainties-related constraints as distributionally robust (DR) chance constraints. These DR chance constraints are reformulated as tractable linear programs. Consequently, the proposed model leads to a mixed-integer linear program. Numerical results on a modified IEEE 39-bus system show that incorporating PFR from EVs can reduce total costs from $4,540,396 to $4,431,233, which is reduced by 2.4%.

maybe,,Design and Validation of Adaptive Barrier Function Sliding Mode Controller for a Novel Multisource Hybrid Energy Storage System Based Electric Vehicle,"Conventional vehicles emit many pollutants and natural gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which reduce air quality and global warming. Due to their extensive consumption, another driving force behind the search for alternatives is the fast depletion of fossil fuels, oil, and natural gas. Consequently, Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) have recently been the subject of substantial research to tackle the dual problems of harmful emissions and resource depletion. This research attempts to develop a novel barrier function-based adaptive sliding mode controller (BFASMC) for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of electric Vehicle (EV). The HESS comprises a fuel cell (FC), battery, supercapacitor (SC), and photovoltaic (PV). The FC serves as a primary source, while the others are auxiliary sources. DC converters are employed to couple these sources to a DC bus. The proposed BFASMC stabilizes and regulates the DC bus voltage. The system’s global stability has been assured through Lyapunov criteria and verified through phase plane (error and error differential) analysis. The proposed controller is compared with conventional sliding mode controller (SMC), integral SMC (ISMC), and double integral SMC (DISMC). The simulation (MATLAB/Simulink) and hardware in loop results (dSPACE MicroLabBox RTI1202) authenticate robustness, efficacy, resilience, chattering free operation, and superiority of proposed BFASMC compared with conventional SMC variants.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3471893,2024,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2024.3471893,12,high
maybe,,Traceable and Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme for Energy Trading in V2G Networks,"With the rapid popularization of electric vehicles (EVs) in modern society, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has been widely concerned as an emerging technology. However, various privacy and security issues arise frequently in the energy interaction between EVs and the smart grid (SG), such as the lack of secure authentication and disclosure of EVs’ identity. Although many crypto-based schemes are proposed to achieve secure authentication of V2G networks, they rely on certificate authority (CA) or private key generator (PKG). In response to this problem, some certificateless signature-based schemes have been proposed. Nevertheless, most of them are not suitable for V2G networks due to the high computational cost and communication overhead, and they do not consider the problem of tracking illegal signatures. Therefore, we propose a traceable and privacy-preserving authentication scheme with supporting batch verification for energy trading in V2G networks. We use the method of binary tree level traversal to quickly track EVs with illegal signatures, which can reduce computational resources. Besides, the proposed scheme is easier to be deployed in real world because of avoiding the problems of key escrow and certificate management. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis and performance evaluation regarding our scheme. We prove that our proposed scheme is secure under the random oracle model (ROM), and the experimental results illustrate that the proposed scheme has less computational cost and communication overhead as compared to the existing schemes.",10.1109/JIOT.2023.3311800,2024,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/jiot.2023.3311800,12,high

Considering the cyber-attacks on the nodes of the sensor and actuator networks of the IPSs, the distributed remote estimators (REs) are first constructed based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and the cyber-attacks models for the sensor and actuator networks are constructed. Then, to compensate for the influence of cyber-attacks and optimize the system state, the estimator-based distributed optimal control strategy is proposed. By constructing the control objective with the control performance index and estimation performance index, the novel optimal attack compensation approach is proposed. Furthermore, the distributed RE-based adaptive dynamic programming with the online finite-time actor–critic algorithm is implemented to solve the secure control strategy effectively. To illustrate the stability of the IPSs with the proposed control strategy, the property of the proposed control scheme is analyzed theoretically, and the finite-time convergence performance with the finite-time gradient learning algorithm is illustrated, which is different from the asymptotic convergence for the existing work.

The proposed circuit can be widely utilized to ensure the stable operation of various systems, as inductor values in PMICs may fluctuate despite being identical components. The proposed Inductance-Variation-Insensitive (IVI) buck converter directly senses the rate of change of inductor current and transmits information about the output voltage and inductance to a dynamic ramp generator. The dynamic ramp generator produces a ramp signal proportionate to the sensed inductor current slope, thereby maintaining a deadbeat state and preventing subharmonic oscillations. This innovative approach enables the converter to function seamlessly across a wide range of output values while maintaining overall stability.

Yet, the deeply intertwined information and communication technologies have exposed smart city management to malicious cyberattacks vastly. This study develops a two-stage mitigation strategy for integrated transportation-energy systems (TESs) by coordinating energy and transportation systems to safeguard against false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Our strategy targets social engagements by electric vehicle (EV) users who can be incentivized to alter their regular EV usage patterns for supporting the energy system via vehicle-to-grid actions. We consider a TES that contains a multi-energy system comprised of power and gas systems as well as an urban transportation system. Integrated system operators can take emergency measures to coordinate important system assets (e.g., traditional generators, renewable generators, EV fleets) in a sensible and intelligent way, and thereby mitigate the consequences of FDIAs. Specifically, we take a two-stage distributionally robust approach to cope with uncertain FDIAs, with which a moment-based ambiguity set is employed to yield the worst-case uncertainty distribution. We leverage constraint generation-based relaxation to solve the problem iteratively. To demonstrate our strategy's value and practical utilities, we use a coupled urban TES to conduct case studies.

In Bakhshayesh and Kebriaei (2022), the problem of choosing the route and CSs of EVs is modeled as a non-cooperative game of selfish EVs with probabilistic decision strategies. In this paper, we have proposed a linear pricing policy that ensures global efficiency of the obtained Nash strategies of EVs in Bakhshayesh and Kebriaei (2022) for the Smart City Coordinator (SCC). We model the problem as a hierarchical game with a SCC as the leader and EVs as the followers. The leader aims to design optimal price functions of CSs and Traffic Coordinator (TC) and impose them on the EVs to maximize the social profits of CSs and TC. In response, the followers play a non-cooperative game with coupling constraints to optimally decide on their route and charging destination. Thus, we have a Stackelberg Game (SG) between SCC and EVs and also a Nash game among the EVs in the lower level. Compared to the conventional Nash-based pricing policies, our proposed functional SG formulation enables the possibility of simultaneous and global-optimum management of traffic and CSs’ crowdedness.

Unlike traditional Zeta converter, which offers buck-boost gain, an AC-DC converter in this study, utilizes a switched capacitor configuration to efficiently step-down voltage in a single phase, bridging the gap between the AC grid and low potential battery assemblies. This design incorporates a coupled inductor structure and operates in discontinuous inductor current mode (DICM), reducing the size of magnetic components and overall dimensions of converter and power factor correction (PFC) rectifier. DICM operation provides intrinsic PFC and minimizes switching losses, ensuring exceptional grid-side performance with unity power factor and minimal input current harmonic distortions, while maintaining an optimal battery charging profile. The meticulously developed hardware prototype, rated at 450 W, features precise component selection and carefully designed modes of operation. Performance analysis reveals a converter peak efficiency of 94.7 %, total harmonics distortion (THD) in input current at 2.7 % under rated conditions, and near unity power factor with zero phase displacement between input voltage and current.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prime.2024.100652,2024,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prime.2024.100652,12,high
maybe,,Optimal scheduling of DG and EV parking lots simultaneously with demand response based on self-adjusted PSO and K-means clustering,"Recently, the proliferation of distributed generation (DG) has been intensively increased in distribution systems worldwide. In distributed systems, DGs and utility-owned electric vehicle (EV) to grid aggregators have to be efficiently scaled for cost-effective network operation. Accordingly, with the penetration of power systems, demand response (DR) is considered an advanced step towards a smart grid. To cope with these advancements, this study aims to develop an innovative solution for the day-ahead sizing approach of energy storage systems of EVs parking lots and DGs in smart distribution systems complying with DR and minimizing the pertinent costs. The unique feature of the proposed approach is to allow interactive customers to participate effectively in power systems. To accurately solve this optimization model, two probabilistic self-adjusted modified particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) algorithms are developed and compared for minimizing the total operational costs addressing all constraints of the distribution system, DG units, and energy storage systems of EV parking lots. The K-means clustering and the Naive Bayes approach are utilized to determine the EVs that are ready to participate efficiently in the DR program. The obtained results on the IEEE-24 reliability test system are compared to the genetic algorithm and the conventional PSO to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithms. The results show that the first SAPSO algorithm outperforms the algorithms in terms of minimizing the total running costs. The finding demonstrates that the proposed near-optimal day-ahead scheduling approach of DG units and EV energy storage systems in a simultaneous manner can effectively minimize the total operational costs subjected to generation constraints complying with DR. © 2022 The Authors.

maybe,,Hybrid transmission expansion planning and reactive power planning considering the real network uncertainties,"Conventional transmission expansion planning (TEP) has evolved with the increasing influence of distributed generations (DGs) and electric vehicles (EVs). This increases uncertainty in power systems. On the other hand, reactive power plays a key role in voltage stability, so modeling reactive power planning in TEP is very important. The amount of reactive power is a determining factor regarding the stability of the network voltage and in case of shortage, occurrence of some events may endanger the voltage stability. This research aims at proposing a hybrid TEP and reactive power planning for the first time. Furthermore, the impact of wind, PV power plants, and EVs, as the common sources of uncertainties, are included. The ultimate goal of HTEP-RPP is to find the transmission line candidates that meet the reactive power requirements. The simulation case studies on IEEE 24- and 118- buses confirm that the TEP based on DCPF may lead to some unreliable operating conditions due to violating the voltage constraints. In this case, the HTEP-RPP results, by applying the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), are more comprehensive and effective than the results obtained by gravitational search algorithm (GSA), for the studied problem or even the popular TEP solutions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1002/jnm.2937,2022,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1002/jnm.2937,12,high

This was done by performing a capacity expansion optimization of the generation fleet for the year 2040. It was assumed that there would be 2.8 million EVs by 2040, informed by global estimates. Two EV charging scenarios were tested, one using an aggregated fixed charging profile based on existing literature and another where the charging demand was optimized by the power system based on least cost. The results showed that additional capacity was required to meet the demand. For both scenarios, the least-cost capacity investment technologies chosen were the same, although the quantities differed. This indicates that the least-cost technology choice was robust against the charging profiles. The optimized charging profile led to lower system costs and a slightly higher energy share from solar relative to the fixed charging case. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00202-021-01345-y,2022,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s00202-021-01345-y,12,high
maybe,,A new power system active rescheduling method considering the dispatchable plug-in electric vehicles and intermittent renewable energies,"The significant penetration of renewable power generations (RGs) and the large-scale use of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have brought tangible impacts in tackling the climate change challenge the mankind has been facing due to substantive green-house gas and pollutant emissions from fossil-fuel based thermal power generation plants. However, the uncertainty of RGs has also exerted significant challenges to the grid operation and control. Therefore, dynamic power system scheduling to accommodate the intermittent RGs and mass roll-out of PEVs has become extremely important. In this paper, a novel power system rescheduling strategy is proposed to tackle this problem. Considering the uncertainty of the wind energy, a set of indices according to different wind power application scenarios is proposed to initiate a rescheduling scheme for power generations. In addition, a social learning particle swarm optimization algorithm based on real-value and binary parallel is proposed to schedule the output of generator units and the charging and discharging of the PEV. The effectiveness of the proposed active rescheduling framework and solving algorithm has been verified by extensive experiments considering different number of generating units and scenarios, achieving up to over 5.3% cost reduction. The experimental results have also shown that through expropriate management of the charging and discharging of PEVs would be significantly alleviate the negative impact on the grid stability caused by the intermittent wind power generations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118715,2022,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118715,12,high
maybe,,Convolutional neural networks in estimating the spatial distribution of electric vehicles to support electricity grid planning,"From the perspective of electricity distribution networks and the energy system, the increasing numbers of electric vehicles are among the most topical and challenging problems. The paper investigates a novel approach of a convolutional neural network-based modeling method for estimating the spatial distribution of electric vehicles. The proposed model extracts features from multilayer socioeconomic input raster data that are sequenced in strides and outputs a spatial estimation of EV distribution. Spatial forecasting or area forecasting is at the core of the distribution system operators’ planning and development process as it provides a solid foundation for stochastic load modeling and load development analysis. Present models mostly focus on stochastic load modeling, lacking the spatial forecasting aspect of EV distribution. The proposed model aims to enhance EV load modeling by providing a more accurate spatial approach to the models. The study uses large actual socioeconomic and vehicle registration data sets to tackle the modeling challenge. In comparison with previous studies on similar topics, the present study benefits from more samples resulting from an increase in the adoption of electric vehicles. The proposed model architecture performs adequately in predicting a spatial electric vehicle distribution; the CNN model reached a weighted average precision score of 0.91. The proposed methodology greatly enhances stochastic EV load modeling by providing a good spatial forecast of the initial EV locations, and the results can be further aggregated to support the electricity distribution system planning process.

maybe,,Optimal scheduling for unit commitment with electric vehicles and uncertainty of renewable energy sources,"The unit commitment (UC) problem is a typical mixed integer nonlinear programming problem related to power systems. As electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs; e.g., wind and solar power) have become integrated into the power system, the UC problem has become increasingly complex. With the continuous growth of the proportion of renewable energy based on wind and solar energy in the power supply structure on the supply side in the future, the random characteristics of the supply and demand sides of the power system will become more obvious, which will inevitably bring about the safety, stability and economic operation of the power system.The system. The study of UC not only has great academic value, but also has important practical significance.The significance. The optimal scheduling of UC, including thermal, wind, solar, and EV power units was investigated. The objective function of optimal scheduling was to minimize the operating cost of the unit and optimize the charging and discharging costs of EVs. In view of power generation characteristics of RESs, an interval number was introduced to describe the uncertainties in the outputs of wind and solar power generation. The enhanced-interval linear programming is introduced to deal with the UC problem including EVs and uncertainty of RES. For better accuracy, wind power was considered for each of the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) and solar power was divided into sunny, cloudy, and rainy conditions. To reflect the influence of EV charging and discharging on UC, three different charging and discharging pricing schemes were considered. Various scenarios were simulated using the CPLEX solver. The results showed that costs can be affected by season and climate. The interval number solution sets of the total cost and of the charging and unit costs were obtained by using interval number theory to describe the uncertainty of output in RESs; this provides a new approach for solving the UC optimization problem by integrating RESs. The charging and discharging of EVs can also affect costs. By encouraging the orderly charging and discharging of EVs, power load fluctuations could be reduced and peak-load shifting could be achieved. Different pricing schemes had different impacts on cost. The pricing scheme can not only effectively reduce the charging cost borne by EV owners, but could also make EVs profitable. This discovery provides a theoretical basis for guidance on the charging and discharging of EVs through charge and discharge price schemes. The simulation results reflect the relationship between economic cost and seasons/climate and confirm the suitability of using an interval number to describe uncertainty in energy generation. © 2022 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.egyr.2022.09.087,2022,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyr.2022.09.087,12,high

maybe,,Soft clustering based probabilistic power flow with correlated inter temporal events,"There is a growing demand to deploy renewable energy sources (RES) and plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging station (EVCS) in distribution networks. This, however, will change power grid landscapes and potentially impose uncertainties in short and long term grid planning. The solution to quantify randomness of intermittent events is to implement probabilistic power flow (PPF) analysis. The computation of PPF due to myriad sources of unknown uncertainties is very expensive. This computation analysis becomes more complex when inter-period temporal-spatial correlation and multivariate uncertainties are considered. This paper addresses the issue by resorting to a novel hybrid nonparametric algorithm for short-term PPF analysis in radial distribution networks. The proposed algorithm deals with probabilistic nonlinear loads, unit generators including PV panels, Wind farms, and EVCS charging pattern. Temporal correlation characterized by memory coefficient is used to model inter-event temporal correlation (IETC) over multiple time steps. Detailed uncertainty modeling of PEVs driving and their queues at EVCSs are included. The proposed method is superior over other existing numerical methods as it accounts for the multivariate inter temporal uncertainty events of RES and PEVs charging. Simulation results in a spatio-temporally correlated IEEE 34 node radial distribution system revealed that using IETC coefficients leads to improved prediction accuracy with average error less than 2.5% and improves the computation burden. The proposed method is applied to IEEE 123 node to test the performance of our proposed method. A comparative analysis is done with other well-known analytical/numerical methods. The PPF Computation time of our proposed method is shown to be faster than other methods when IETC is implemented.

However, smart management of PEVs in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system can result in benefits to the grid such as load leveling, and cost reduction. This paper proposes a unit commitment model for a V2G system connected to a smart power grid. The model considers different penetration levels of PEVs and investigates the economic and technical effects of using PEVs to support the grid. The proposed methodology incorporates controlled charging and discharging as well as accounting for battery degradation in the unit commitment problem. The model is tested using an IEEE 24 bus network to determine the impact of high PEV penetration on generation cost. A comparison between a system without V2G and a system with V2G is presented to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach.

maybe,,Resilience-oriented optimal post-disruption reconfiguration for coupled traffic-power systems,"The increasing penetration of grid-enabled electric vehicles (EVs) renders road networks (RNs) and power networks (PNs) increasingly interdependent for normal operation. For this reason, recently few studies have started to investigate the vulnerability of a highly coupled traffic-power system in the presence of disruptive events. Actually, however, only very few of these studies have considered the impact of EVs on the interdependent traffic-power system during restoration from a disruptive event. In an attempt to fill this gap, in this study, we investigate the restoration planning of both independent RNs and PNs, and interdependent traffic-power systems. A mixed integer program model is formulated to provide optimal reconfiguration and operational solutions for post-disruption traffic-power systems recovery. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost incurred by system performance loss, which is quantified by the cumulative unmet traffic demand for RNs and load shedding cost for PNs. Several reconfiguration strategies are considered, including links reversing in RNs and line switching in PNs, to optimize system resilience. In the proposed model, the integrated problem of system optimal dynamic traffic assignment and optimal power flow is solved to derive the optimal traffic-power flow. RNs and PNs are coupled through the coordinately allocated spatio-temporal charging demand of EVs. A partial highway network in North Carolina (NC), USA, and a modified IEEE-14 bus system are used to illustrate the application of the model. The numerical results obtained show the added value of coordinately planning restoration for traffic-power systems and the effects of different levels of EV penetration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ress.2022.108408,2022,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ress.2022.108408,12,high

New requirements such as the high power loads of Electric Vehicles' charging are putting pressure on grids, and the popularisation of the figure of the prosumers, are creating new needs on the management of the system. Although the investment on infrastructure is one of the ways of alleviating the arrival of this new loads, the existence of smart controls, actuators and smart appliances opens also the door for demand modification. The so called Demand Response Events are strategies to reallocate the loads of the consumers, so the power demand is shifted towards times less critical for the grid. Some smart appliances can be considered as shiftable. The operation of them can be rescheduled to other times and still provide their services. On this paper we suggest an optimisation methodology consisting on a parallelisation method together with a generic algorithm that would allow an overlooking controller (such as aggregator or DSO) reduce the power peaks even with a large number of devices to control. The research here presented has looked for the smallest group size at which the optimisation is more effectible done in parallel groups rather than on a single large set. With this, we eliminated the exponential growth of the computational effort that the optimisation algorithm would need to do organising all devices in one go. The method achieves a computational time reduction of 80\%, and it is only worsening the reduction of peak by 2.8\% compared to an optimisation with a complete set. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

maybe,,Analysis of Optimal Integration of EVs and DGs Into CIGRE’s MV Benchmark Model,"In today’s transportation sector, the growing number of electric vehicles (EVs) is progressively replacing petroleum-fueled vehicles, which are also expected to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. The main problem with EVs is the requirement of charging energy, which is fed through distribution network, while simultaneously feeding already connected load. The EV’s integration with the distribution network will overload the network due to EV’s charging load, which will eventually trip the power system protection. In this context, it is necessary to minimize power losses, improve voltage profile with sustainable power supply network. Therefore, optimal placement of EVs is required in the distribution network. Conventionally, researchers have used DGs to minimize power losses and improve voltage profile. In this paper, authors analyzed the effect of EV’s integration with simultaneous placement of distributed generations (DGs). The integration of EVs with higher penetration of DGs is cumbersome due to higher power losses and voltage variances that are outside allowable boundaries. The optimal placement of EVs into the distribution system with higher penetration of DGs is proposed in this paper using a battle royale optimization (BRO) algorithm. Since it is a new problem on CIGRE network which is not discussed before. Hence, the authors compared results with three most famous algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and accelerated PSO (APSO). The optimization problem is developed as a multi-objective function while decreasing active and reactive power losses, and minimising maximum voltage deviation index. The studied distribution network is the CIGRE 14-bus medium voltage (MV) distribution network. Three case studies are taken in which EVs are integrated in two scenarios with optimally sized and located DGs systems in the CIGRE distribution network using MATLAB. Case-1 includes simple network with DGs integration. Case-2 includes EVs only in the simple network, and case-3 finally includes EVs and DGs for optimal placement with minimum losses. The placement of the EVs results in a decrease in power losses and voltage deviation indices. The bus voltages of case-2, on the other hand, stay unchanged when the EVs are integrated. Case 3 with BRO showed the large reduction in power losses owing to the addition of EVs to the distribution network with DGs (from 19.98 kW, and 19.89 kVar to 2.54 kW, and 3.35 kVar).",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204311,2022,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2022.3204311,12,high

The increasing penetration of IoEV will have a great impact on the transportation network and power grid. In this work, we aim to study the routing and charging scheduling problem of IoEVs with the constraint of power limit. This paper proposes a clustered rolling framework and a mathematical model for the IoEVs optimal routing and charging problem to minimize the waiting time of customers and get a good converge ratio of the energy block with power limit. This framework can effectively deal with the multi-step pickup and delivery of each vehicle over the time horizon in a dynamic environment. We give a criterion to judge whether pickup and delivery tasks can be assigned to the IoEV. Then, we design a new rectangle packing method for IoEV charging dispatch with the constraint of power limit.

Different from the resistive load, CPL may make the EVDCPS unstable. Thus, in addition to less overshoot and shorter setting time, the controller of the converter applied in EVDCPS should maintain the system stable. In this article, the finite-time controller (FTC) is proposed based on exact feedback linearization (EFL) to stabilize the EVDCPS feeding CPL. First, to handle the nonlinearity caused by the CPL, the affine nonlinear model of EVDCPS is transformed into the Brunovsky canonical form by using EFL. Then, the finite-time control is adopted and a PI compensator is designed to eliminate the steady-state error. Under the proposed control algorithm, rigorous proofs indicate that not only the closed system can be large-signal stable, but also the EVDCPS bus voltage can converge the reference in finite time. Furthermore, to reduce the design difficulty of FTC, the backstepping method is adopted to design a backstepping finite-time controller(BFTC). Finally, simulations and experiments of FTC and BFTC are carried out. Results indicate that both FTC and BFTC have large-signal stability, and although the robustness of BFTC is inferior to FTC, the setting time and overshoot are greatly improved compared with the traditional linear feedback controller.",10.1109/TIA.2021.3125621,2022,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tia.2021.3125621,12,high

This study determines in which municipalities and at what additional cost energy autonomy is feasible for a case study of Germany. An existing municipal energy system optimization model is extended to include the industrial, commercial and personal transport sectors. Multiple regression methods are benchmarked in order to identify the model best suited for the transfer of individual optimization results to a large proportion of German municipalities. The resulting levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from the optimization of representative case study municipalities are transferred using energy-relevant indicators. The study demonstrates that energy autonomy is technically feasible in 6,314 (56%) municipalities. Thereby, the LCOEs increase in the autonomous case on average by 0.41 €/kWh compared to the minimum cost scenario. Apart from energy demand, base-load-capable bioenergy and deep geothermal energy have the greatest influence on the LCOEs.

In this article, we develop a distributed EV charging mechanism (D-EVCM) where each EV possesses some information, such as the charging probabilities of other EVs, electricity price, current energy level, and expected departure time. Based on the information, an EV periodically decides whether to charge its battery in a distributed manner. To minimize the average charging cost of EV while avoiding the situation where an EV departs from a charging station with insufficient energy level, a constrained stochastic game model is formulated and its solution is obtained using a best response dynamics-based algorithm.

In the standard independent Q-learning approach, the coordination performance of agents under partial observability drops at scale in stochastic environments. Here, the novel combination of learning from off-line convex optimisations on historical data and isolating marginal contributions to total rewards in reward signals increases stability and performance at scale. Using fixed-size Q-tables, prosumers are able to assess their marginal impact on total system objectives without sharing personal data either with each other or with a central coordinator. Case studies are used to assess the fitness of different combinations of exploration sources, reward definitions, and multi-agent learning frameworks.

maybe,,Optimal scheduling for unit commitment with electric vehicles and uncertainty of renewable energy sources,"The unit commitment (UC) problem is a typical mixed integer nonlinear programming problem related to power systems. As electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs; e.g., wind and solar power) have become integrated into the power system, the UC problem has become increasingly complex. With the continuous growth of the proportion of renewable energy based on wind and solar energy in the power supply structure on the supply side in the future, the random characteristics of the supply and demand sides of the power system will become more obvious, which will inevitably bring about the safety, stability and economic operation of the power system. The study of UC not only has great academic value, but also has important practical significance. The optimal scheduling of UC, including thermal, wind, solar, and EV power units was investigated. The objective function of optimal scheduling was to minimize the operating cost of the unit and optimize the charging and discharging costs of EVs. In view of power generation characteristics of RESs, an interval number was introduced to describe the uncertainties in the outputs of wind and solar power generation. The enhanced-interval linear programming is introduced to deal with the UC problem including EVs and uncertainty of RES. For better accuracy, wind power was considered for each of the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) and solar power was divided into sunny, cloudy, and rainy conditions. To reflect the influence of EV charging and discharging on UC, three different charging and discharging pricing schemes were considered. Various scenarios were simulated using the CPLEX solver. The results showed that costs can be affected by season and climate. The interval number solution sets of the total cost and of the charging and unit costs were obtained by using interval number theory to describe the uncertainty of output in RESs; this provides a new approach for solving the UC optimization problem by integrating RESs. The charging and discharging of EVs can also affect costs. By encouraging the orderly charging and discharging of EVs, power load fluctuations could be reduced and peak-load shifting could be achieved. Different pricing schemes had different impacts on cost. The pricing scheme can not only effectively reduce the charging cost borne by EV owners, but could also make EVs profitable. This discovery provides a theoretical basis for guidance on the charging and discharging of EVs through charge and discharge price schemes. The simulation results reflect the relationship between economic cost and seasons/climate and confirm the suitability of using an interval number to describe uncertainty in energy generation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.09.087,2022,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.09.087,12,high

This, however, will change power grid landscapes and potentially impose uncertainties in short and long term grid planning. The solution to quantify randomness of intermittent events is to implement probabilistic power flow (PPF) analysis. The computation of PPF due to myriad sources of unknown uncertainties is very expensive. This computation analysis becomes more complex when inter-period temporal-spatial correlation and multivariate uncertainties are considered. This paper addresses the issue by resorting to a novel hybrid nonparametric algorithm for short-term PPF analysis in radial distribution networks. The proposed algorithm deals with probabilistic nonlinear loads, unit generators including PV panels, Wind farms, and EVCS charging pattern. Temporal correlation characterized by memory coefficient is used to model inter-event temporal correlation (IETC) over multiple time steps. Detailed uncertainty modeling of PEVs driving and their queues at EVCSs are included. The proposed method is superior over other existing numerical methods as it accounts for the multivariate inter temporal uncertainty events of RES and PEVs charging. Simulation results in a spatio-temporally correlated IEEE 34 node radial distribution system revealed that using IETC coefficients leads to improved prediction accuracy with average error less than 2.5% and improves the computation burden. The proposed method is applied to IEEE 123 node to test the performance of our proposed method. A comparative analysis is done with other well-known analytical/numerical methods.

Of all the different services, the ones that can be provided by EV-charger are highlighted and classified into 12 geo-electrical charging clusters. Second, the focus is moved to the flexibility providers. Independently from location, to provide ancillary services with EVs, multiple actors are recognized: the end-user, the charging site operator (CSO), the charging point operator (CPO), the aggregator, the energy community, the distribution system operator (DSO), and the transmission system operator (TSO). The collaboration between the actors is today carried out by making alliances, to help exchange knowledge and gain confidence in ancillary services provision.

maybe,,Challenges and opportunities in decarbonizing the U.S. energy system,"The United States has pledged to develop a 100% carbon-free electric power system by 2035 and a net-zero-emissions economy by 2050. While important advancements have been made in the scale, performance, and economics of clean energy technologies, meeting the nation's ambitious goals will not only require their deployment at scale, but also additional innovation and effective integration of different solutions. Technological developments across the broad suite of low-carbon energy solutions are advancing rapidly, with ongoing innovations in renewable electricity generation, industrial processes, and energy-saving technologies and services, including LED lighting, induction heating, electric vehicles, energy storage solutions, and mobility as a service, plus smart devices, controls, and more efficient and smart buildings. Combining renewable electricity with biotic and abiotic pathways to produce chemicals, fuels, and materials promises to deliver new solutions. Grid-interactive buildings and communities, integrating transportation infrastructure and vehicles, are likely to be significant components of any zero-carbon energy strategy. Low-carbon industrial manufacturing will also make strong contributions to a net-zero economy. While the technical prospects appear promising, variations in the state of infrastructure, jurisdictional and social equity, pollution, economic and socio-cultural constraints, energy resource availability, and supply chain dynamics found in different locations present a range of challenges and demand customized solutions.

Further, to determine the optimal placement of EVCSs & Distribution Generator (DG) for mitigating the losses & improving the voltage profile Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) algorithm proposes. HHO is a widespread swarm-based, gradient-free optimization technique based on the supportive action & hunting characteristic of Harris hawks in nature with numerous energetic phases of exploration & exploitation. The active, reactive power limits and different operational constraints of URDS consider while minimizing the losses. It observed that the unbalanced radial distribution network could survive the deployment of EVCSs at the vital buses up to a certain extent. However, the allocation of EVCSs at the weak buses of the network prevents the power system's stable operation. The analysis performs on the IEEE 25 bus Unbalanced radial distribution network for the placement of EVCS & DG.

maybe,,Real-time realization of network integration of electric vehicles with a unique balancing strategy,"This article introduces a unique dynamic balance strategy (DBS) that can overcome many disadvantages such as voltage and frequency deviations, overloading, high infrastructure costs that may occur in the network integration of electric vehicles (EVs). The proposed method is also aimed at keeping the comfort and satisfaction of the EV users at a high level without the obligation of the EV owners to inform the operator of the entry and charge planning. DBS introduces a real-time energy-sharing method that uses both the grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) topologies simultaneously without knowing the power demand profile in advance. However, from the perspective of smart grid, it is also possible to activate the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) topology in case of frequency or voltage fluctuations in the network with the proposed DBS. The proposed DBS was simulated in real time and phasor analysis for different penetration levels in MATLAB/Simulink program. Considering that EV driver behavior is highly variable and will vary regionally, it is shown that the proposed DBS gives dynamic results against all behavioral situations, varying penetration levels, and all the negativities that may occur in the penetration of EVs are overcome by keeping the satisfaction of EV drivers at a high levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00202-021-01259-9,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s00202-021-01259-9,12,high
maybe,,Modelling of decarbonisation transition in national integrated energy system with hourly operational resolution,"In this paper, we present an optimisation integrated energy system model (IESA-Opt) for the Netherlands with the use of a linear programming formulation. This state-of-the-art model represents a scientific contribution as it integrates a European power-system model with a complete sectoral representation of the energy system technologies and infrastructure that account for all greenhouse gas emissions considered in the targets, and takes into consideration a detailed description of the cross-sectoral flexibility (e.g. flexible heat and power cogeneration, demand shedding from power-to-X and electrified industrial processes, short- and long-term storage of diverse energy carriers, smart charging and vehicle-to-grid for electric vehicles, and passive storage of ambience heat for the built environment). This model provides a detailed description of the operation of technologies and considers exogenous technological learning to simultaneously solve multi-year planning of investments, retrofitting, and economical decommissioning with intra-year operational, flexible, and despatch decisions. The model is applied to a case study of the Netherlands energy transition under the current climate policy and conservative projections for the economy and availability of resources. The results present a significant reliance on renewable energy sources, such as wind (800 PJ) and solar (300 PJ), to fuel the electrification revolution as well as biomass (550 PJ) for feedstock and heat purposes coupled with carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) to achieve negative emissions in certain sectors. However, oil (880 PJ) and gas (1050 PJ) constitute almost half of the final energy demand as they are required for heat applications, industrial feedstock, refined oil products for export, and international transport fuel. Four different sensitivity analyses are presented for the emission reduction target, oil demand streams, biomass availability, and demand volumes. The most significant findings are as follows: 1) it is crucial to have simultaneous highly available biomass and CCUS storage capacities to achieve negative emissions and facilitate the transition; 2) even in a highly decarbonised scenario, it is necessary to simultaneously develop climate policies focused on international transport emissions, oil-based feedstock, and refined-oil product exports to completely displace oil from the energy mix; 3) (imported) biomass has the ability to decrease system costs (3% under conservative scenarios of availability and price); however, for biomass prices higher than 20 €/GJ, this effect is lower; 4) in relative terms, the system is most sensitive to demand uncertainties from the transport sector than any other sector, followed closely by the industrial sector. © 2021 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.adapen.2021.100043,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.adapen.2021.100043,12,high
maybe,,Techno-economic design of energy systems for airport electrification: A hydrogen-solar-storage integrated microgrid solution,"Can aviation really become less polluting? The electrification of airport energy system as a micro-grid is a promising solution to achieve zero emission airport operation, however such electrification approach presents the engineering challenge of integrating new energy resources, such as hydrogen supply and solar energy as attractive options to decarbonize the present system. This paper explores the techno-economic benefits of integrating hydrogen supply, electric auxiliary power unit (APU) of aircraft, electric vehicles, photovoltaic energy (PV), and battery storage system into electrified airport energy system. The hydrogen fuel cell generation provides great flexibility to supply aircraft at remote stands, and reduces the carbon emissions caused by traditional fuel-powered APU. A mixed integer linear programming optimization method based on life cycle theory is developed for capacity sizing of hydrogen energy system, PV and battery storage, with optimization objective of minimizing the total economic costs as well as considering environmental benefits of the proposed airport microgrid system. Case studies are conducted by five different energy integration scenarios with techno-economic and environmental assessments to quantify the benefits of integrating hydrogen and renewable energy into airport. Compared with the benchmark scenarios, the integration of hydrogen energy system reduced the total annual costs and carbon emissions of airport energy system by 41.6% and 67.29%, respectively. Finally, sensitivity analysis of key system parameters such as solar irradiance, grid emission factor, elctricity price, carbon tax, unit investment cost of hydrogen energy system have been investigated to inform the design of hydrogen-solar-storage integrated energy system for future airport electrification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116374,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116374,12,high
maybe,,"An energy paradigm transition framework from negative towards positive district energy sharing networks—Battery cycling aging, advanced battery management strategies, flexible vehicles-to-buildings interactions, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis","In response to the clean power production with large-scale deployment of renewable systems, technical challenges are proposed, including the resilient and smart building system design, cycling aging of battery storages, energy congestion between renewable and flexible grid energy, the flexible micro-grids to energy supply fluctuations in multi-energy systems, and so on. In this study, a series of technical solutions, including the integration of plug-in vehicles (under multi-directional energy interaction paradigms), the Vehicles-to-Buildings interaction levels, and the grid-responsive control, were proposed, studied, and discussed to promote the resilient and smart energy systems from district levels in subtropical regions. Dynamic battery cycling aging and advanced modelling tool in this study outperforms traditional rough battery cycling aging approaches, and correct conclusions on battery and vehicle-to-building interaction, to avoid the battery performance overestimation. Novel energy management strategies advance traditional power flow strategy, in terms of the off-peak grid electricity shifting, the enhancement of renewable penetration, and the deceleration of battery cycling aging. Techno-economic performances have been investigated, including net present value (NPV), the discounted payback time (DPT), and the net direct energy consumption (DEC). Furthermore, the energy paradigm transition from negative to positive building–vehicle systems outperforms single case study in academia for carbon-neural transition. The research results showed that, with the energy paradigm transition from the negative to the positive system, the net present value increases from −7.182 × 107 to 5.164 × 108 HK$, and the average annual net DEC decreased from 249.1 to −343.3 kWh/m2.a. Furthermore, compared to Control Strategy 2 (grid-responsive control strategy), the proposed Control Strategy 3 (battery-protective control strategy) can improve the net present value, and the increasing magnitude is dependent on the specific energy paradigm. Furthermore, compared to the positive buildings-vehicle system, the impact of the vehicle-to-building interaction on the decreasing magnitude of the net present value is more prominent for the negative system. The uncertainty and sensitivity analyses indicate that the net present value of the positive energy paradigm as compared to the negative energy paradigm is more sensitive to the battery cost. This study demonstrates the techno-economic performance of district building–vehicle systems with the energy paradigm transition from the negative to the positive, together with a series of effective solutions. The research results can provide multi-dimensional effective approaches for district energy sharing systems in subtropical regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116606,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116606,12,high
maybe,,A distributed computing framework for multi-stage stochastic planning of renewable power systems with energy storage as flexibility option,"An integrated generation, transmission, and energy storage planning model accounting for short-term constraints and long-term uncertainty is proposed. The model allows to accurately quantify the value of flexibility options in renewable power systems by representing short-term operation through the unit commitment constraints. Long-term uncertainty is represented through a scenario tree. The resulting model is a large-scale multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem. To overcome the computational burden, a distributed computing framework based on the novel Column Generation and Sharing algorithm is proposed. The performance improvement of the proposed approach is demonstrated through study cases applied to the NREL 118-bus power system. The results confirm the added value of modeling short-term constraints and long-term uncertainty simultaneously.

maybe,,Quantile based probabilistic wind turbine power curve model,"Wind turbine power curve is an indicator of wind turbine performance and important input of wind farm design or power prediction, therefore can serve the system planning and operation. However, a good power curve model is difficult to obtain because of the uncertain relationship between wind speed and its power output. Existing works focus on a deterministic model or use probabilistic distribution to represent such uncertain relation, which is not easy to be employed by the following decision-makers. This paper presents a novel concept termed as quantile power curve, which generates a series of power curves under any confidence level. Quantile loss based neural network algorithm is proposed to establish the quantile power curve. Index to measure the wind turbine performance and power generation uncertainty is also proposed based on the quantile power curve. Based on the operational data of a Chinese wind farm, the proposed model and index are validated and employed to estimate the wind energy yield when planning a system with wind, solar and electric vehicle charging loads. The results show that quantile power curve provides more comprehensive information about the uncertainty during the power generation process and helps to improve the renewable supply rate to charging loads. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116913,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116913,12,high
maybe,,Prediction of voltage distribution using deep learning and identified key smart meter locations,"The energy landscape for the Low-Voltage (LV) networks is undergoing rapid changes. These changes are driven by the increased penetration of distributed Low Carbon Technologies, both on the generation side (i.e. adoption of micro-renewables) and demand side (i.e. electric vehicle charging). The previously passive ‘fit-and-forget’ approach to LV network management is becoming increasing inefficient to ensure its effective operation. A more agile approach to operation and planning is needed, that includes pro-active prediction and mitigation of risks to local sub-networks (such as risk of voltage deviations out of legal limits). The mass rollout of smart meters (SMs) and advances in metering infrastructure holds the promise for smarter network management. However, many of the proposed methods require full observability, yet the expectation of being able to collect complete, error free data from every smart meter is unrealistic in operational reality. Furthermore, the smart meter (SM) roll-out has encountered significant issues, with the current voluntary nature of installation in the UK and in many other countries resulting in low-likelihood of full SM coverage for all LV networks. Even with a comprehensive SM roll-out privacy restrictions, constrain data availability from meters. To address these issues, this paper proposes the use of a Deep Learning Neural Network architecture to predict the voltage distribution with partial SM coverage on actual network operator LV circuits. The results show that SM measurements from key locations are sufficient for effective prediction of the voltage distribution, even without the use of the high granularity personal power demand data from individual customers. © 2021 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100103,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100103,12,high
maybe,,Stochastic synergies of urban transportation system and smart grid in smart cities considering V2G and V2S concepts,"Serious challenges such as rapid growth in population, environmental pollution, and possibility of energy shortage have motivated researchers for designing optimal energy operation strategies through the concept of smart city. Buildings and electric transport systems, especially subway systems and Plug in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), are among the major energy consumption systems in a smart city. In this paper, a linear model is proposed for the co-optimization planning and operation of distributed energy resources and transportation systems in an interconnected system that analyzes the interactions of such an interconnected system. The idea of Regenerative Breaking Energy (RBE) is deployed to improve the operation of the subway system through the interconnected subway system in the smart city. For the optimal operation of the smart city, an optimization formulation is devised to minimize the total cost of the city in the presence of subway RBE. In this paper, the traffic and length of the routes are modeled considering Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to Subway (V2S) located in the parking lots. Furthermore, the degradation model is developed to increase the PEVs’ battery life. An unscented transformation (UT) approach is utilized to construct a stochastic framework based on the uncertainty method, to handle the uncertain behaviors of PEVs and distributed energy resource and loads in the smart city.

Such participation relies on the prediction of available capacity to support the reliable delivery of agreed reserves at a future time. In this work real historical trip data from a fleet of vehicles belonging to the University of Nottingham was used and a simulation developed to show how battery state-of-charge and available capacity would vary if these trips were taken in electric vehicles that were charged at simulated charging station locations. A time series forecasting neural network was developed to predict aggregated available capacity for the next 24-h period given input data from the previous 24 h and its increased predictive capability over a regression model trained using automated machine learning was demonstrated. The simulations were then extended to include delivery of reserves to satisfy the needs of simulated market events and the ability of the model to successfully adapt its predictions to such events was demonstrated. The authors conclude that this ability is of critical importance to the viability and success of future V2G services by supporting trading and vehicle utilisation decisions for multiple market events. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119813,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119813,12,high

Nowadays, the electricity market participation entails making decisions aided by a support and information system, which is an important part of a microgrid support management system. The microgrid support management system developed in this paper has a formulation based on a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem that depends on knowledge of the stochastic processes that describe the uncertain parameters. A set of plausible scenarios computed by Kernel Density Estimation sets the characterization of the random variables. But as commonly happen, a scenario reduction is necessary to avoid the need to have significant computational requirements due to the high degree of uncertainty.

maybe,,Mobile energy hub planning for complex urban networks: A robust optimization approach,"The electricity grid with a high penetration of renewable energy can enable travelers to travel free of emissions using state-of-the-art electric vehicles (EVs). Extensive electric vehicle demands at the peak-times, and an increase in electricity consumption due to population growth, have led to higher utility infrastructure investments. Mobile energy hubs i.e. clustered EVs parked in a dedicated location, can be used as an innovative demand-side management solution to reduce long-term utility infrastructure investments. They can store and release electricity to the grid based on consumer demand. However, a scientific planning approach for grid integration has been overlooked. Accordingly, this study proposes a comprehensive framework required to plan and develop mobile energy hubs based on optimization of life cycle cost, access distance and parking duration considering the temporal variation of EV recharging demands. The results of the study show that the framework developed can minimize lifecycle costs, and improve infrastructure utilization by accounting for the interests of all stakeholders. The total cost with the proposed robust optimization model under uncertainties of 50% is lesser than the robust cost calculated from a scenario-based approach. Furthermore, the developed framework is useful for recharging infrastructure planners to devise the deployment schedules and attract investors based on the economic viability of the planned strategies. © 2021",10.1016/j.energy.2021.121424,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2021.121424,12,high

The proposed approach helps to upgrade the infrastructure satisfying the demand for high penetration of EVs with least expansion cost. This approach proposes a routing signal for the arriving EV at the parking lot to guide them to a suitable charger according to the charger and EV battery statuses. The proposed signal increases the utilization EV chargers. Also, the planning approach jointly considers the PV allocation to provide more energy and power capacity for chargers and to reduce overall energy cost. This proposed approach considers coordinated charging /discharging, creating bidirectional power flow between the grid and the EVs. The planning problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program to maximize the net annual revenue. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation technique is utilized to account for the uncertainties associated with the PV generation and the power demand.

maybe,,Energy management of a renewable-based isolated micro-grid by optimal utilization of dump loads and plug-in electric vehicles,"This paper proposes a new day-ahead energy management system (EMS) for an off-grid fishing island micro-grid (MG). The MG considered in this work is well equipped with smart grid infrastructure and embedded with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Moreover, it is a green and fossil fuel free MG without any conventional power plant. The MG provides its load demand by solely renewable generations, including wind farms (WF) and photovoltaic (PV) power plants. Therefore, keeping balance between generation and demand is a difficult task in day-ahead operation planning of this MG. In order to overcome this obstacle, the MG uses a mega-scale battery energy storage system (BESS). However, the capacity of the BESS is limited and it is not economically feasible to increase the BESS capacity. Therefore, the MG considers PEVs G2V/V2G operation modes planning and dump loads optimal utilization as supplementary balance options. The main dump loads in this MG are industrial fish refrigerators (IFRs) and reverse osmosis desalination system (RODS). These dump loads in addition to PEVs’ G2V/V2G modes of operation are scheduled in the EMS proposed in this paper.

By exploiting Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) such as solar energy (PV) and wind energy (WT) as widely acknowledged RESs to be more environmentally friendly and address power difficulties. They are acknowledged to be an interesting option to charge Electric Vehicles (EVs) via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. On the contrary, to the best knowledge of the authors, there are few numbers published articles on RESs (PV and WT) integrated with Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) to charge EVs. This research is aimed at implementing a metaheuristic optimization algorithm named Antlion Optimizer (ALO) algorithm for sizing the system components to meet the load demand and minimize the two objective functions - Losses Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and Cost of Electricity (COE) while maximizing the Renewable Energy Fraction (REF). In addition, the Rule-Based Energy Management Strategy (RB-EMS) is proposed to control the flow of power in the system. The integration of RESs to the utility grid with V2G technology and V2G services is discussed. Furthermore, the State-of-the-art for improving the stability and reliability of the grid-connected system is presented.

maybe,,Plug-in behavior of electric vehicles users: Insights from a large-scale trial and impacts for grid integration studies,"Electric vehicle (EV) grid integration presents significant challenges and opportunities for electricity system operation and planning. Proper assessment of the costs and benefits involved in EV integration hinges on correctly modeling and evaluating EV-user driving and charging patterns. Recent studies have evidenced that EV users do not plug in their vehicle every day (here called non-systematic plug-in behavior), which can alter the impacts of EV charging and the flexibility that EV fleets can provide to the system. This work set out to evaluate the effect of considering non-systematic plug-in behavior in EV grid integration studies. To do so, an open-access agent-based EV simulation model that includes a probabilistic plug-in decision module was developed and calibrated to match the charging behavior observed in the Electric Nation project, a large-scale smart charging trial. Analysis shows that users tend to plug-in their EV between 2 and 3 times per week, with a lower plug-in frequency for large-battery EVs and large heterogeneity in user charging preferences. Results computed using our model show that non-systematic plug-in behavior effects reduce the impact of EV charging, especially for price-responsive charging, as fewer EVs charge simultaneously. On the other hand, non-systematic plug-in can reduce available flexibility, particularly when considering current trends towards larger battery sizes. Counter-intuitively, large-battery fleets can have reduced flexibility compared to small-battery fleets, both in power and stored energy, due to lower plug-in frequency and higher energy requirements per charging session. Improving plug-in ratios of EV users appears as key enabler for flexibility. In comparison, augmenting charging power can increase the flexibility provided by EV fleets but at the expense of larger impacts on distribution grids. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.etran.2021.100131,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.etran.2021.100131,12,high

Results show that installing PV panels and storage systems not only reduces the dwellings’ grid energy demand by 31% in January but also helps the dwellings to become net exporters of green electricity to the grid in July and hence saves a substantial amount of money by taking advantage of Feed-in and Economy 7 tariffs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.renene.2021.01.059,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2021.01.059,12,high
maybe,,Multicriteria power generation planning and experimental verification of hybrid renewable energy systems for fast electric vehicle charging stations,"The installation of fast electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) will be essential to promote the acceptance by the users of electric vehicles (EVs). However, if EVCS are exclusively supplied by the grid, negative impacts on its stability together with possible CO<inf>2</inf> emission increases could be produced. Introduction of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) for EVCS can cope with both drawbacks by reducing the load on the grid and generating clean electricity. This paper develops a weighted multicriteria methodology to design the most suitable configuration of HRES for EVCS. This method determines the local renewable resources and the EVCS electricity demand. Then, taking into account environmental, economic and technical aspects, it deduces the most adequate HRES power generation planning for EVCS. Besides, an experimental stage to validate the design deduced from the multicriteria methodology is included.

maybe,,"The key issues of electric vehicle charging via hybrid power sources: Techno-economic viability, analysis, and recommendations","Recently, electric vehicles (EVs) have been intensively utilized in various parts of the world. Because the use of EVs allows the prompted minimization of fossil fuel consumption, this modern mode of transport is regarded as environmentally friendly. Nevertheless, despite the benefits they afford, EVs cannot be extensively adopted worldwide because of the insufficiency of charging station infrastructures. Accordingly, there have been several attempts to establish EV charging stations supplied by a fossil fuel-powered main grid with electricity. However, these types of charging infrastructures can negatively impact the distribution system and environment; it can therefore result in peak load increment. A potential and efficient solution is the utilization of self-sustainable sources (such as photovoltaic (PV) energy), which can mitigate the adverse effects of fossil fuels. With this solution, the planning of the distribution system should be appropriate to satisfy the load demand because a large number of EVs will be connected to the grid. Because of the increasing importance of this subject, in this manuscript, PV-EV stand-alone connection and PV-EV-Grid in hybrid connection of charging system topologies and their associated control architectures are critically enumerated, presented, and discussed; several perspectives and problems that confront the EV charging technology are also highlighted. Furthermore, the impact of numerous EVs connected to the electricity grid is reviewed, and the analysis of various EV charging scheduling techniques and control topologies proposed in available literature is presented. Finally, research suggestions on the economic value assessment of grid operation and EV load, recommendations, and future research directions are underscored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.rser.2020.110534,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.rser.2020.110534,12,high
maybe,,Energy management considering simultaneous presence of demand responses and electric vehicles in smart industrial grids,"Due to a growing trend in electricity consumption and limitations in expanding the capacity of power plants, the issue of privatizing and restructuring the electricity industry has come to the fore. In this regard, with the emergence of competitive markets, drawing upon responsive programs and electric vehicles in planning smart networks has become an intense topic of research. This paper presents a new method for programming industrial virtual power plants (IVPP) considering synchronous presence of demand response programs and electric vehicles. The proposed algorithm aims at maximizing the proceeds from industrial networks through demand response planning and managing the energy consumption of electrical vehicles. The algorithm is implemented in Zone 2 of the modified version of the IEEE Reliability Test System. The simulation results show that the presence of electric vehicles in the parked position will increase the storage capacity of the IVPPs, whereupon the consumption load on IVPPs is reduced. Using demand response programs in this regard and selecting the best program for each IVPP at different times of the day cuts back on both network operating costs and high consumption peaks, whereby an improvement in the efficiency of electric vehicles parking schemes is obtained. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.seta.2021.101127,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.seta.2021.101127,12,high

While decision-making, it is necessary to guarantee that all scheduled tasks are completed with reliability against stochastic electricity consumption. We discover that a large fleet size and a high charging infrastructure capacity can reduce the minimum necessary battery capacity, and this tradeoff is crucial in the optimization.

The electrification of vehicles is a promising solution to this widespread problem; however, integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into existing grid systems on a large scale creates several problems, both for consumers and for utilities. Accelerated aging of expensive grid assets, such as power transformers, is one of the primary issues that these utilities are facing. This problem can be addressed with battery energy storage systems (BESS), which acts as buffer between demand and supply. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel strategy for optimal sizing of BESS based on thermal loading of transformers. This paper also investigates issues associated with high penetration levels of rooftop photovoltaics (PVs), determining the synergy between EV charging load and BESS. The proposed solution is treated as an optimization problem, in which a new time of use (ToU) tariff is utilized as a demand response signal to reduce the accelerated aging of transformers.

Unlike existing works, the present article explicitly considers the uncertain implications of incentive policy on PEV owners’ charging behaviors and its effects in PL planning. For this aim, a regret-matching technique is introduced to model the bounded rationality of PEV owners in deciding the choice to use different charging options for recharging their vehicle, as a dependency with respect to the incentive value and the accessibility of the charging service in long-term horizon. Such endogenous uncertainties are considered simultaneously with the inherent exogenous randomness of PEV demand and captured by the proposed PL planning model using a proper scenario generation method. The resulting model turns out to be a two-stage stochastic programming with decision-dependent uncertainties and it is solved by using the genetic algorithm.

However, existing planning approaches generally aim to minimize investment costs in PDSs while ignoring the risk of worsening traffic conditions. To overcome this research gap, this article integrates the interests of traffic networks into PDS and FCS joint planning model to mitigate negative impacts on traffic conditions caused by installing FCSs. First, a novel microscopic method that is different from traditional assignment methods is proposed to simulate the influences of FCSs on traffic flows and EV charging loads. Then, a multiobjective joint planning model is developed to minimize both the planning costs and unbalanced traffic flows. A new bilayer Benders decomposition algorithm is designed to solve the proposed joint planning model. Numerical results on two practical systems in China validate the feasibility of our microscopic method by comparing the simulated results with real data.

It integrates a fast scheduling optimization into a meta-heuristic grid-planning algorithm. The grid-planning algorithm uses Delaunay triangulation and an ant colony systems approach. The scheduling optimization combines dynamic programming and a fast heuristic to consider grid constraints. The last section presents exemplary results and illustrates effects of different regulatory regimes on costs. Results suggest that market-based scheduling will prevail due to energy cost-savings.

With proper evaluation, distribution system operators can decide on a reasonable course of action for encouraging energy flexibility and make predictions on the recommended timing and magnitude of system updates under different scenarios. However, there is no efficient tool for system operators to quickly set up and perform simulations of alternative scenarios for system updates before planning their course of action, without much experience with programming or system modeling. This paper proposes an agent-based modeling framework for developing agent-based simulation models of business ecosystems that can be applied to multiple evaluation scenarios by simple configuration of agents and roles. There are two steps in this proposed framework: Step 1 – Interface and role interactions design and Step 2 – Agent architecture and connections design. In addition, the framework depends on a pre-step that covers mapping and architecture development of the business ecosystem to be modeled. The framework is demonstrated with a case study of an energy business ecosystem consisting of an electricity distribution grid with 137 connected domestic consumers. The case study shows that the proposed agent-based modeling framework supports the development of agent-based models for simulating energy business ecosystems.

Although conventional carrier-based modulations (CBMs) and space vector modulations (SVMs) have been commonly applied and extensively studied for three-phase four-leg voltage-source converters, very little has been reported concerning their pollution impact on AC grid in terms of switching ripple currents. This paper introduces a thorough analytical derivation of peak-to-peak and RMS values of the AC current ripple under balanced and unbalanced working conditions, in the case of three-phase four-leg converters with uncoupled AC-link inductors. The proposed mathematical approach covers both phase and neutral currents. All analytical findings have been applied to two industry recognized CBM methods, namely sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (PWM) and centered PWM (equivalent to SVM). The derived equations are effective, simple, and ready-to-use for accurate AC current ripple calculations. At the same time, the proposed equations and diagrams can be successfully adopted to design the conversion system basing on the grid codes in terms of current ripple (or total harmonic distortion (THD)/total demand distortion (TDD)) restrictions, enabling the sizing of AC-link inductors and the determination of the proper switching frequency for the given operating conditions.

Resulting issues are expected to be mitigated by charging control. In particular, voltage-based charging control, by relying only on the local measurements of voltage at the point of connection, provides an autonomous communication-free solution. The controller, attached to the charging equipment, compares the measured voltage to a reference voltage and adapts the charging power using a droop control characteristic. We present a systematic study of the voltage-based droop control method for electric vehicles to establish the usability of the method for all the currently available residential electric vehicle charging possibilities considering a wide range of electric vehicle penetra-tions. Voltage limits are evaluated according to the international standard EN50160, using long-term load flow simulations based on a real distribution grid topology and real load profiles. The results achieved show that the voltage-based droop controller is able to mitigate the under voltage problems completely in distribution grids in cases either deploying low charging power levels or exhibiting low penetration rates. For high charging rates and high penetrations, the control mechanism improves the overall voltage profile, but it does not remedy the under voltage problems completely. The evaluation also shows the controller’s ability to reduce the peak power at the transformer and indicates the impact it has on users due to the reduction in the average charging rates. The outcomes of the paper provide the distribution grid operators an insight on the voltage-based droop control mechanism for the future grid planning and investments. © 2021 by the authors.

Recently, the process of designing solar charging stations as flexible sources has been growing and developing. This paper presents a relatively complete design of a solar charging station as a flexible economic resource in a 10-year planning horizon based on a genetic algorithm in two scenarios. PVCSs are not considered in the first scenario. This scenario is only to confirm the results, and the proposed method is proposed. However, in the second scenario, the effects of PVCSs and the demand response strategy (DR) on this development are considered. Copula probability distribution functions are used to create appropriate scenarios for vehicles during different planning years. The proposed energy management system shows a stable performance in terms of the annual load growth index and electricity price of each level of demand over the time horizon along with minimizing power losses and costs required, which makes PVCS efficiency higher and gives them a suitable structure and stability. The modeling results in terms of uncertainties in the system indicate that the use of load management along with PVCS design and flexible electric vehicle charge control strategies improves power quality parameters and optimizes system cost over a period of 10 years. Compared to the obtained results with the traditional case, it is observed that long-term planning in terms of DR and PVCSs and the technical specifications of the network have been improved.

This model provides a detailed description of the operation of technologies and considers exogenous technological learning to simultaneously solve multi-year planning of investments, retrofitting, and economical decommissioning with intra-year operational, flexible, and despatch decisions. The model is applied to a case study of the Netherlands energy transition under the current climate policy and conservative projections for the economy and availability of resources. The results present a significant reliance on renewable energy sources, such as wind (800 PJ) and solar (300 PJ), to fuel the electrification revolution as well as biomass (550 PJ) for feedstock and heat purposes coupled with carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) to achieve negative emissions in certain sectors. However, oil (880 PJ) and gas (1050 PJ) constitute almost half of the final energy demand as they are required for heat applications, industrial feedstock, refined oil products for export, and international transport fuel. Four different sensitivity analyses are presented for the emission reduction target, oil demand streams, biomass availability, and demand volumes. The most significant findings are as follows: 1) it is crucial to have simultaneous highly available biomass and CCUS storage capacities to achieve negative emissions and facilitate the transition; 2) even in a highly decarbonised scenario, it is necessary to simultaneously develop climate policies focused on international transport emissions, oil-based feedstock, and refined-oil product exports to completely displace oil from the energy mix; 3) (imported) biomass has the ability to decrease system costs (3% under conservative scenarios of availability and price); however, for biomass prices higher than 20 €/GJ, this effect is lower; 4) in relative terms, the system is most sensitive to demand uncertainties from the transport sector than any other sector, followed closely by the industrial sector.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adapen.2021.100043,2021,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adapen.2021.100043,12,high

maybe,,Interdependence between transportation system and power distribution system: a comprehensive review on models and applications,"The rapidly increasing penetration of electric vehicles in modern metropolises has been witnessed during the past decade, inspired by financial subsidies as well as public awareness of climate change and environment protection. Integrating charging facilities, especially high-power chargers in fast charging stations, into power distribution systems remarkably alters the traditional load flow pattern, and thus imposes great challenges on the operation of distribution network in which controllable resources are rare. On the other hand, provided with appropriate incentives, the energy storage capability of electric vehicle offers a unique opportunity to facilitate the integration of distributed wind and solar power generation into power distribution system. The above trends call for thorough investigation and research on the interdependence between transportation system and power distribution system.

maybe,,Evaluating grid-interactive electric bus operation and demand response with load management tariff,"Electric Vehicles are expected to play a vital role in the transition of smart energy systems. Lots of recent research has explored numerous underlying mechanisms to achieve the synergetic interactions in the electricity balancing process. In this paper, the grid-interactive operation of electric buses is first time integrated within a dynamic market frame using the Distribution Locational Marginal Price algorithm for load congestion management. Since the defined problem correlates the opportunity charging flexibility with the bus mobility over a network, the tempo-spatial distribution of energy needs can be reflected in the dynamic of service planning. The interactions between bus operators and suppliers are quantitatively modelled by a bi-level optimisation process to represent the electric bus service planning and electricity market clearing separately. The effectiveness of the proposed load management has been demonstrated using data collected from an integrated real-world bus network. Experiments show that engagement of electric bus charging load in demand response is helpful to alleviate the network congestion and to reduce the power loss by 7.2% in the distribution network. However, alleviated charging loads have exhibited counter-intuitive capability for load shifting. The restricted electric bus operational requirements leads to a 8.17% loss of charging demand, while the reliance on large batteries has increased by 10.57%. However, the sensitivity analysis also shows that as the battery cost declines, the such discourage implications on grid-interactive electric bus operation will decrease once the battery cost below 190/kWh. The optimal grid-ebus integration have to consider the trade-off between range add-up, reduced battery cost and additional benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113798,2019,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113798,12,high
maybe,,Optimal renewable generation and battery storage sizing and siting considering local transformer limits,"In response to climate change and sustainability challenges, various incentive programs have increased solar photovoltaic (PV) generation interconnection in the low voltage electrical distribution system. However, electric utility support of PV generation is limited by reverse power flow into the electricity network at high penetration levels. This limits the ability to achieve Zero Net Energy (ZNE) behind individual meters and in whole communities. In parallel, district level energy systems, and Advanced Energy Communities (AEC) that include storage, offer a great prospect for integrating high levels of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into the built environment. Optimally designing such systems to serve communities, commercial, and industrial loads, while maximizing the penetration of solar PV, has been a challenge to Distribution System Operators (DSO) and city planners. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) optimization to decide the best DER portfolio, allocation, and dispatch, for an AEC that achieves ZNE and islanding while respecting electrical grid operational constraints, with a focus on distribution transformer overloads. The main strategies to avoid transformer overloads were found to be judicious sizing and siting of battery energy storage and also optimally re-distributing PV throughout the community, which increased the ability of the electric infrastructure to support a PV deployment that is 1.7 times larger than the existing transformer capacity without the need for infrastructure upgrades. This work highlights the importance of including local infrastructure capacities, such as distribution transformer constraints when developing projects that result in high renewable penetration throughout the distribution network. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113926,2019,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113926,12,high

PEV adoption increases electricity consumption from the grid that could either exacerbate electricity supply shortages or smooth demand curves. The optimal coordination and commitment of power generation units while ensuring wider access of PEVs to the grid are, therefore, important to reduce the cost and environmental pollution from thermal power generation systems, and to transition to a smarter grid. However, flexible demand side management (DSM) considering the stochastic charging behavior of PEVs adds new challenges to the complex power system optimization, and makes existing mathematical approaches ineffective. In this research, a novel parallel competitive swarm optimization algorithm is developed for solving large-scale unit commitment (UC) problems with mixed-integer variables and multiple constraints – typically found in PEV integrated grids. The parallel optimization framework combines binary and real-valued competitive swarm optimizers for solving the UC problem and demand side management of PEVs simultaneously. Numerical case studies have been conducted with multiple scales of unit numbers and various demand side management strategies of plug-in electric vehicles. The results show superior performance of proposed parallel competitive swarm optimization based method in successfully solving the proposed complex optimization problem.

The constraints involve the electric power system reliability check, ensuring charging reliability and the required quality of service of the charging infrastructure. In ensuring the charging reliability, at least one candidate location must be selected within the driving range of electric vehicles and suitable charging technologies placed to accommodate the disposable charging times of electric vehicle users for the requested quality of service. The proposed optimization model presents an upgrade of an existing optimization formulation since it includes a power system reliability check based on a DC power flow model. To show the general applicability and significance of the model, a test 10 × 10 grid road network and a standard six-bus test power system are considered.

Big-data should be handled for accurate modeling of PEVs load demand. Therefore, the utilization of data mining tools will be helpful for PEVs data analytics and clustering. In this paper, a Factor Analysis (FA) based method is introduced for the PEVs data mining. The load profiles of PEVs that are extracted by Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) are clustered in some groups optimally using FA method. The clustered data is applied on Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) and Distributed Generation (DGs) planning procedure, separately. The simulation results show the power demand of PEVs effect on both ESSs and DGs planning, however, the temporal feature of PEVs profiles affects only on ESS planning, but not considerably on DG planning. This temporal feature, here called Storage to Storage (S2S) effect, reflects the nature of PEVs and ESS long-term memory which is discussed in this paper. The simulation results show that the optimal ESSs capacity is reduced if the PEVs data are clustered especially in high PEVs penetration.

Thus, the importance of a robust power system especially in the distribution network level is indisputable. During the planning or reinforcement stage of distribution networks, it is paramount to have some estimations and analyses done on system-wide EV charging loads that will be placed in the network. Thus, this paper systematically investigates the EV fleet composition, market shares, and charging patterns within New Zealand (NZ) area. A multivariate probabilistic modelling of dependent random variables and cumulative distribution functions is adopted for the accurate estimation of aggregated EV charging demands. Several vehicle travel survey data sets are utilised to quantitatively determine charging behaviours and driving patterns of EVs.

Voltage-dependent loads (VDLs) were used to analyze the total power loss and load voltage deviation (LVD) under different EV load models and the general load of the electrical power system. The VDL was defined in the backward stage where the voltage ratio was between bus voltages per nominal voltage. The IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system was selected to be the test system. The EV penetration level was defined as 26.88\% compared to the base case of constant power (P). The simulation results showed the impact levels from EV load models to the grid based on the traditional method, with impact levels from high to low being for polynomial load (EVI), constant current load (EVIII), and VDL (EVII) models, respectively. In particular, the highest impact for EVI was in scenario 4 (D), where the total active power loss, total reactive power loss, and LVD were 3.45\%, 3.47\%, and 3.36\%, respectively. Therefore, the EV load model was one important factor to select for solving the power flow of the grid.

maybe,,Scenario-based planning of fast charging stations considering network reconfiguration using cooperative coevolutionary approach,"In recent years, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have attracted a great deal of attention because of environmental issues. For large-scale integration of PEVs, appropriate siting and sizing of PEV charging stations are essential. In this paper, a framework for simultaneous fast charging stations (FCSs) planning and distribution network reconfiguration is proposed. The distribution network reconfiguration is effectively used to optimize objective functions. The objective function considered is defined as the sum of the initial investment and energy loss costs subject to different distribution system constraints. In the model, a scenario-based approach is used for taking into account uncertainties of traditional electric load, FCS load, and electricity price. To reduce the computational burden of the problem, a scenario reduction technique is utilized. A cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA) is employed to solve the problem. The FCSs locations and the network switches are coded separately, and they evolve cooperatively as two different species, i.e., the location species and the switch species. Furthermore, an efficient technique called Dijkstra's algorithm is used to calculate FCSs sizes in which the nearest FCS to PEVs is determined based on their driving distance from FCSs on their path to their destination. Finally, the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by numerical results. More specifically, use of the proposed scenario-based approach yields to a more accurate solution than deterministic method. In addition, usage of network reconfiguration in FCSs planning both reduces the total costs and improves the voltage profile. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.est.2019.04.024,2019,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2019.04.024,12,high

There is a global consensus in increasing the share of renewable energy-based generation in the overall mix, transitioning to a more environmental-friendly transportation with electric vehicles as well as liberalizing the electricity markets, much to the distaste of traditional utility companies. All of these changes are against the status quo and introduce new paradigms in the way the power systems operate. The generation penetrates distribution networks, renewables introduce intermittency, and liberalized markets need more competitive operation with the existing assets. All of these challenges require using some sort of storage device to develop viable power system operation solutions. There are different types of storage systems with different costs, operation characteristics, and potential applications. Understanding these is vital for the future design of power systems whether it be for short-term transient operation or long-term generation planning.

maybe,,A Synthetic Case Study for Analysis of the Rising Interdependency between the Power Grid and E-Mobility,"Critical infrastructures are interdependent systems that are continuously evolving. Their evolution is, oftentimes, in a way that tightens, or creates new, interdependences. As urban areas continue to develop, the philosophy of officials and policy makers to meet growth in the energy demand tends to prioritize sustainable planning by deferring infrastructural upgrades and relying instead on the smart operation. Relying on information and communication technology (ICT) network is a prerequisite to achieving smart operation. With the anticipated high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs), increased reliance on real-time monitoring and control is a must for the power grid to handle such unprecedented levels of load/generation uncertainties. This paper sheds light on how the power grid, the ICT network, and the transportation network are interrelated and interdependent.

maybe,,A Partial Augmented Lagrangian Method for Decentralized Electric Vehicle Charging in Capacity-Constrained Distribution Networks,"This work deals with decentralized optimization problems where a collection of network agents operate selfishly and individually under a set of coupling constraints among them. This collection of problems are motivated by coordinating electric vehicle (EV) charging in a feeder capacity-constrained distribution network where each EV makes decisions locally to achieve the system’s global benefit. First, a centralized scheme is established and admits an optimal coordination behaviour that minimizes the aggregate generation cost and all the EVs’ local costs. However, the coupling of the charging behaviours among the EV population brings challenges to the design of the decentralized algorithm, which is expected to converge to the global optimum. A partial augmented Lagrangian method is presented to disperse the coupling constraint by introducing a penalty term. Combined with the gradient projection method, an iterative procedure is designed such that each EV and feeder line update in parallel until satisfying the terminal condition. The convergence can be guaranteed under some certain mild conditions, and the convergence rate to the global optimum is analysed as well.

Driven by an urgent desire to mitigate the effects of global warming and a foreseen end to the world’s fossil fuel resources, an increasing tendency toward renewable energies is fostered by the international community. On the other hand, distributed generation and electric vehicle adoption are altering load nature and profile. Therefore, energy storage (ES) becomes a necessity for its ability to bridge the gap between the dynamically changing supply and demand in addition to other ancillary services it can provide. Meanwhile, advances in smart grid technologies enable escalating the incorporation of new technologies with more efficient control schemes and energy management algorithms. This paper presents an overview on the employment of ES technologies in planning and operation of distribution systems through the literature survey.

maybe,,Decentralized EV-Based Charging Optimization With Building Integrated Wind Energy,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have experienced a rapid growth due to the economic and environmental benefits. However, the substantial charging load brings challenging issues to the power grid. Modern technological advances and the huge number of high-rise buildings have promoted the development of distributed energy resources, such as building integrated/mounted wind turbines. The issue to coordinate EV charging with locally generated wind power of buildings can potentially reduce the impacts of EV charging demand on the power grid. As a result, this paper investigates this important problem and three contributions are made. First, the real-time scheduling of EV charging is addressed in a centralized framework based on the ideas of model predictive control, which incorporates the volatile wind power supply of buildings and the random daily driving cycles of EVs among different buildings. Second, an EV-based decentralized charging algorithm (EBDC) is developed to overcome the difficulties due to: 1) the possible lack of global information regarding the charging requirements of all EVs and 2) the computational burden with the increasing number of EVs. Third, we prove that the EBDC method can converge to the optimal solution of the centralized problem over each planning horizon. Moreover, the performance of the EBDC method is assessed through numeric comparisons with an optimal and two heuristic charging strategies (i.e., myopic and greedy). The results demonstrate that the EBDC method can achieve a satisfactory performance in improving the scalability and the balance between the EV charging demand and wind power supply of buildings. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the challenging problem due to the substantial charging load of electric vehicles (EVs) on the power grid. Nowadays, modern technological advances and the rapid increase of high-rise buildings have promoted the development of building integrated/mounted wind turbines. As the EVs are usually parked in buildings for a large proportion of time every day, the issue to best utilize locally generated wind power of buildings to suffice EV travelling requirements shows vital significance in reducing their dependence on the power grid. However, there exist two main challenges including: 1) the multiple uncertainties regarding the uncertain wind power generation and the random driving behaviors of EVs and 2) the scalability of the solution method. To tackle the first challenge, the idea of model predictive control is introduced to make charging decisions at each stage based on a short-term prediction of the on-site wind power and the current collection of EVs parked there. To consider the scalability and overcome the lack of global charging information of all EVs in practical deployment, an iterative EV-based decentralized charging algorithm (EBDC) is derived, in which each EV can dynamically update its own charging decisions according to a dynamic charging “price” announced by the buildings. Alternatively, the buildings dynamically adjust the charging “price” to motivate the EVs to get charged during the time periods with sufficient wind power supply. Numeric results demonstrate that the EBDC method is scalable and performs well in improving the balance between the EV charging demand and the wind power supply of buildings.",10.1109/TASE.2018.2856908,2019,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tase.2018.2856908,12,high
maybe,,Reliability-Based Metrics to Quantify the Maximum Permissible Load Demand of Electric Vehicles,"The continuous increase of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to introduce several challenges to power systems among which is the deteriorating reliability of power supply. This paper proposes two adequacy metrics to quantify the maximum permissible EV loads for a power system without deteriorating its reliability and the required improvements to power systems to accommodate high penetrations of EVs, which are defined as follows: 1) extra effective available energy for EVs' charging (EEAE-EVs) and 2) extra effective required generation to accommodate EVs (EERG-EVs). The EEAE-EVs provides a measure for the maximum amount of EV loads that a power system can accommodate without adding new generation while maintaining its reliability. The EERG-EVs provides a measure to the minimum amount of new generation that is needed to restore the reliability level of a power system if the load of EVs exceeds the maximum permissible load of the system. These metrics provide a decision aid to power system planners and operators on when and how to perform generation expansion. The importance of the proposed metrics is demonstrated on the IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE RTS) with real EV charging data. The sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is used in evaluating the well known power system reliability indices, the EEAE-EVs, and the EERG-EVs. The results show that a power system can accommodate EV loads without deteriorating its reliability as long as EV loads do not exceed the EEAE-EVs of the system. For the IEEE RTS, the EERG-EVs shows that the amount of the required generation to maintain system reliability is about half of the added EV loads from 330-660 MW.",10.1109/TIA.2019.2914877,2019,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tia.2019.2914877,12,high

Hence, there is a need for comprehensive planning of charging infrastructure in order to prevent power failures or scenarios where there is a considerable demand-supply mismatch. Accurately predicting the realistic charging demand of EVs is an essential part of the infrastructure planning. Charging demand of EVs is influenced by several factors, such as driver behavior, location of charging stations, electricity pricing, etc. In order to implement an optimal charging infrastructure, it is important to consider all the relevant factors that influence the charging demand of EVs. Several studies have modeled and simulated the charging demands of individual and groups of EVs. However, in many cases, the models do not consider factors related to the social characteristics of EV drivers. Other studies do not emphasize on economic elements. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of the above factors on EV charging demand using a simulation model.

With an increase in grid-connected vehicles, the power grid needs to increase its generation capacity to meet their charging demand. Thus, from a grid perspective, it is essential to find the maximum number of EVs that the existing infrastructure can handle. This research proposes a new framework to identify the fleet size capability of a power network in both uncontrolled and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) modes of operation. The proposed model is modeled as an optimization problem and tested on a system that is formed by combining IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system and a ten-unit generation system. Simulation results show that the current system can handle a fixed number of EVs when they operate independently. Participation of EVs in a V2G market significantly enhances the fleet size handling capability of the existing infrastructure, which is approximately four times the present capacity. Furthermore, a relation between the fleet size of EVs and operating points of plants is extracted, which is very beneficial for system planners.

The retired EVBs, after repurposing, can serve as an alternative option to new batteries in a BESS. In addition, when a microgrid operator desires to install a BESS, the optimal decisions such as installation year, energy and power size, replacement year, and the number of cycles to failure, that are normally overlooked, have to be determined. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive and novel framework for planning and operation of the BESS based on repurposed EVBs. A novel linearized BESS sizing model is proposed that obtains the BESS optimal decisions regarding design and operation. Various new, modified, and linearized relationships for the BESS have been included in the planning model to ensure that the replacement year of the BESS is optimally determined.

This paper presents a new multistage distribution expansion planning model where investments in distribution network assets, RES, ESS, and EV charging stations are jointly considered. The charging demand necessary for EV transportation is performed using a vehicle model based on travel patterns. The variability associated with RES along with the demand requires the incorporation of uncertainty, which is characterized through a set of scenarios. These scenarios are generated by the k-means++ clustering technique that allows keeping the correlation in the information of the uncertainty sources. The resulting stochastic program is driven by the minimization of the present value of the total expected cost including investment, maintenance, production, losses, and non-supplied energy.

maybe,,Supply and demand side flexibility options for high renewable energy penetration levels in south africa,"This paper presents a study on supply and demand side flexibility resources assessed for two South African power system expansion scenarios with high penetrations of variable renewable energy. The demand response opportunities associated with residential water heating as well as plug-in electric vehicles are included in order to demonstrate demand-side flexibility options. Supply-side options are based on existing and optimally deployed new-build generation technologies. The scenario based results indicate that the combination of cost reductions in wind, solar PV and stationary storage (batteries), results in economic deployment of batteries in South Africa. Battery storage complements flexibility provided by demand response and supplyside options. A notable outcome is the displacement of gas-fired turbines by batteries when assuming cost reductions for batteries in the future. Finally, despite the extensive deployment of battery storage, a significant 55 TWh of energy from solar PV and wind is curtailed. Therefore, effective sector-coupling could make extensive use of this curtailed energy in a number of ways to be identified as part of future research. © 2019 South African Institute of Electrical Engineers.

These stations can perform smart charging processes, and can take advantage of the involvement of distributed generation sources in a microgrid framework. Furthermore, since photovoltaic batteries and EVs are sources based on direct current (DC), the realization of a DC microgrid structure is promising, though challenging. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear procedure for determining optimal operation planning of a DC-based electric vehicle supply infrastructure is proposed. The procedure aims at optimizing daily operational costs, based on forecast of photovoltaic production and EV exploitation. Peculiar aspects of energy storage devices and of the DC microgrid framework are accounted for through a non-linear iterative procedure.

The calculated maximum load, which is higher than the current load, is expected to cover the expected needs for electric vehicles charging. Following the proposed operational patterns, it is possible to have always maximum line capacity. This method is able to offer several benefits.

maybe,,Data-driven EV load profiles generation using a variational auto-encoder,"Although the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution networks can improve the energy saving and emission reduction effects, its random and uncertain nature limits the ability of distribution networks to accept the load of EVs. To this end, establishing a load profile model of EV charging stations accurately and reasonably is of great significance to the planning, operation and scheduling of power system. Traditional generation methods for EV load profiles rely too much on experience, and need to set up a power load probability distribution in advance. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for load profiles of EV generation using a variational automatic encoder. Firstly, an encoder composed of deep convolution networks and a decoder composed of transposed convolution networks are trained using the original load profiles. Then, the new load profiles are obtained by decoding the random number which obeys a normal distribution. The simulation results show that EV load profiles generated by the deep convolution variational auto-encoder can not only retain the temporal correlation and probability distribution nature of the original load profiles, but also have a good restorative effect on the time distribution and fluctuation nature of the original power load. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/en12050849,2019,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en12050849,12,high

However, the unreasonable construction of charging stations causes problems such as low user satisfaction, waste of land resources, unstable power systems, and so on. Reasonable planning of the location and capacity of charging stations is of great significance to users, investors and power grids. This paper synthetically considers three indicators of user satisfaction: charging convenience, charging cost and charging time. Considering the load and charging requirements, the model of electric vehicle charging station location and volume is established, and the model based on artificial immune algorithm is used to optimize the solution. An empirical analysis was conducted based on a typical regional survey. The research results show that increasing the density of charging stations, lowering the charging price and shortening the charging time can effectively improve user satisfaction. The constructed site and capacity selection optimization solving model can scientifically guide charging station resource allocation under the constraints of the optimal user comprehensive satisfaction target, improve the capacity of scientific planning and resource allocation of regional electric vehicle charging stations, and support the large-scale promotion and application of electric vehicles. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/en12101915,2019,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en12101915,12,high

The research underpinning this study finds that the greatest value from integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into the power grid can be generated by charging them when and where it is most beneficial for the power system, while ensuring consumers' mobility needs are met at an affordable cost.

This paper presents optimal distributed generator (DG) sizing and location in the power system using PEVs load demand probability. The MATLAB m-file scripts and OpenDSS were applied to solve the proposed study by varying the percentage penetration level of PEVs. A genetic algorithm optimization technique was used to find the best solution of DG installation. The simulation results showed that the PEVs were directly connected to the power grid with 100 PEVs (13.84%), 200 PEVs (27.68%) and 500 PEVs (69.19%), respectively. It was found that the DG sizing also varied with 1.773 MW, 1.663 MW and 1.996 MW, respectively. While the position of the DG also changes according to the sizing of DG. The position of DG was installed at bus No.738, bus No.741 and bus No.711, respectively. Therefore, the optimal DG placement helped to improve and reduce the total line loss and total energy demand from the power grid.

PEV adoption increases electricity consumption from the grid that could either exacerbate electricity supply shortages or smooth demand curves. The optimal coordination and commitment of power generation units while ensuring wider access of PEVs to the grid are, therefore, important to reduce the cost and environmental pollution from thermal power generation systems, and to transition to a smarter grid. However, flexible demand side management (DSM) considering the stochastic charging behavior of PEVs adds new challenges to the complex power system optimization, and makes existing mathematical approaches ineffective. In this research, a novel parallel competitive swarm optimization algorithm is developed for solving large-scale unit commitment (UC) problems with mixed-integer variables and multiple constraints – typically found in PEV integrated grids. The parallel optimization framework combines binary and real-valued competitive swarm optimizers for solving the UC problem and demand side management of PEVs simultaneously. Numerical case studies have been conducted with multiple scales of unit numbers and various demand side management strategies of plug-in electric vehicles.

Big-data should be handled for accurate modeling of PEVs load demand. Therefore, the utilization of data mining tools will be helpful for PEVs data analytics and clustering. In this paper, a Factor Analysis (FA) based method is introduced for the PEVs data mining. The load profiles of PEVs that are extracted by Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) are clustered in some groups optimally using FA method. The clustered data is applied on Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) and Distributed Generation (DGs) planning procedure, separately.

Voltage-dependent loads (VDLs) were used to analyze the total power loss and load voltage deviation (LVD) under different EV load models and the general load of the electrical power system. The VDL was defined in the backward stage where the voltage ratio was between bus voltages per nominal voltage. The IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system was selected to be the test system. The EV penetration level was defined as 26.88% compared to the base case of constant power (P). The simulation results showed the impact levels from EV load models to the grid based on the traditional method, with impact levels from high to low being for polynomial load (EVI), constant current load (EVIII), and VDL (EVII) models, respectively. In particular, the highest impact for EVI was in scenario 4 (D), where the total active power loss, total reactive power loss, and LVD were 3.45%, 3.47%, and 3.36%, respectively. Therefore, the EV load model was one important factor to select for solving the power flow of the grid.

Formulation of the proposed method and its implementation are described in detail. Performance of the estimator is tested by simulations first using a small 84-bus radial distribution system. Then the method's scalability is demonstrated by simulations on two very large scale distribution networks one configured radially and the other meshed each containing over 12 500 buses.",10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3292552,2024,"grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpwrs.2023.3292552,11,high
maybe,,Optimal Dynamic Pricing of Fast Charging Stations Considering Bounded Rationality of Users and Market Regulation,"Electric vehicles (EVs), as popular transportation carriers and flexible electric loads, couple both the power distribution networks and transportation networks. The pricing schemes of fast charging stations significantly affects the EVs’ on-tirp charging behaviors and the operations of coupled power and transportation networks. This interdisciplinary paper proposes an optimal dynamic pricing method for fast charging stations to boost charging network operator’ (CNO’s) profits and avoid excessive charging costs of EVs. Time-varying traffic flow and charging demands are generated by a dynamic traffic assignment simulation, where a boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium model is presented to capture the cost sensitivity of EVs and gasoline vehicle users. Additionally, a market regulator supervises the CNO’s pricing, balancing the interests of the CNO and users via a regulation constraint. To address the optimal dynamic pricing issue, we propose a three-level Stackelberg game involving the distribution network operator, CNO, and users. The existence of a game equilibrium is assured by the fixed-point theory. A Gauss-Seidel iteration algorithm with inertia weight is designed to solve the pricing problem. The numerical results have corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed method, illuminating the effects of bounded rationality and market regulation on the CNO’s profits and users’ travel costs.",10.1109/TSG.2024.3363040,2024,"grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2024.3363040,11,high

Conventional offline optimization algorithms lack real-time applicability due to uncertainties involved in the charging service of an EV charging station (EVCS). Firstly, an optimization model for real-time EV charging strategy is proposed to address these challenges, which accounts for environmental uncertainties of an EVCS, encompassing EV arrivals, charging demands, PVG outputs, and the electricity price. Then, a scenario-based two-stage optimization approach is formulated. The scenarios of the underlying uncertain environmental factors are generated by the Bayesian long short-term memory (B-LSTM) network.

maybe,,Game Theory Approach for Energy Consumption Scheduling of a Community of Smart Grids,"This study analyzes the potential of an independent method of dynamic pricing schemes to reduce the peak demand in the neighborhood area. For this, this work develops a collective energy consumption scheduling (CECS) algorithm in the residential sector based on a combination of energy consumption plans under a bi-level game theory method. The local level is responsible of gathering internal users' data and reducing the energy consumption in each residential building. The central level is the external demand management system that is focused on modeling a coalition between the local load management modules, as well as giving the redistributed demand profile to increase the global profit through a peak load minimization, financial gain and peak-to-average-ratio reduction. Four controllable appliances are included in load shifting and time activation cycling: clothes dryer units, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, electric water heater, and electric vehicle. The principle of the proposed CECS method relies on the flexibility of the user requirement that presents one of the contributions of this study. It proposes a novel framework for determining optimal non-static load management strategies, in which consumers can change their daily power demand patterns depending on their routines, preferences and requirements. Numerical results show that time-varying schemes encourage customers to condense their electricity consumption within low-price periods. However, by incorporating the proposed approach of coordinated scheduling algorithm significant profits in the whole and single level are demonstrated. Simulations infer that given the same load profiles, the proposed framework outperforms the non-coordinated strategy leading to important rates in total peak load minimization, total saving in electricity bills and reduction of peak-to-average-ratio.",10.1007/s42835-023-01379-1,2023,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1007/s42835-023-01379-1,11,high
maybe,,"Stochastic, resilience-oriented optimal sizing of off-grid microgrids considering EV-charging demand response: An efficiency comparison of state-of-the-art metaheuristics","The resilient microgrid (MG) capacity planning and optimisation problem is widely recognised as a non-deterministic polynomial time-hard (NP-hard) problem. Accordingly, metaheuristics – top-level algorithms inspired by various natural and physical processes – can be utilised to determine the near optimality in designing MGs. However, a comprehensive review of the mainstream literature has shown that the performance of several metaheuristics has not yet been evaluated. In response, this paper first systematically benchmarks the efficiencies of previously unexplored metaheuristics in MG sizing applications against the well-established metaheuristic in the literature, namely the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. To this end, the metaheuristics are separately integrated into a novel MG sizing method, which is aware of the optimal demand response capacity procured from electric vehicle (EV)-charging loads. Two grid-independent, 100%-renewable MGs are modelled, which enable the reliable and robust supply of electrical loads in areas far removed from the grid. Furthermore, an advanced EV-charging demand response program is integrated into the overall method, whilst quantifying various sources of time-series data uncertainty and considering specific resilience constraints. The simulation results yielded from three real-world isolated community case studies in Aotearoa-New Zealand confirm the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic, resilience-oriented, EV-charging demand response-addressable MG sizing method. Importantly, the comprehensive statistics-based performance evaluations indicate that new metaheuristics have the potential to outperform the PSO by up to ∼6% in MG sizing applications. This indicates the potentially significant implications of using advanced metaheuristics for improving the economics – and, therefore, rolling out – capital-intensive grid-isolated 100%-renewable MGs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121007,2023,"planning,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121007,11,high

However, our technical and market research in Solar Plus Storage microgrids, carried out as part of a US Department of Energy's Solar Prize project, demonstrates the efficacy of advanced microgrid controls in managing this uncertainty while saving billions of dollars. The control system must be equipped with advanced optimization tools and adaptive forecasting models that minimize planning errors for future optimal operation to achieve this. This study contributes to the literature by quantifying the impact of integrating adaptive learning-based forecasting tools for PV power and electrical load at the tertiary level of a hierarchical control system.

maybe,,Is single-phase residential EV fast-charging a good idea? Evidence from optimal charging plans based on realistic data,"One way to encourage the usage of electric vehicles (EVs) is to reduce the connection time by using higher -powered charging points at home. Nonetheless, a massive adoption of this technology could increase the network power requirements, stressing the grid beyond the technical limits. Therefore, it is important to assess how much the aggregate power will increase compared to the slow-charging process and how to minimize it. Hence, an EV charging coordination model is developed to compare the impact on the system demand of residential slow and fast-charging plans by minimizing the maximum aggregate demand. Here, ``slow{''}and ``fast{''}correspond to the minimum and the maximum charging speeds for 1-phase, mode 3 of the IEC 61851-1. To create an accurate model, realistic UK load profiles, real EV energy requirements, and real travel statistics of car drivers in the UK were included. Additionally, the stochasticity of customers was incorporated by solving the optimization for thousands of different groups of households and EVs. The results indicate that due to the greater flexibility of fast-charging events, if no coordination is considered, the aggregate effects increase by 15\% compared to the slow-charging case. However, if the process is coordinated, nearly the same maximum aggregate demand is found regardless of whether the charging is fast or slow.",10.1016/j.ijepes.2023.109231,2023,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2023.109231,11,high
maybe,,Predicting electric vehicle charging demand using a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph convolutional network,"Short-term Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand prediction is an essential task in the fields of smart grid and intelligent transportation systems, as understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of charging demand over the next few hours could help operators of charging stations and the grid to take measures (e.g., dynamic pricing) in response to varying charging demand. This study proposed a heterogeneous spatial–temporal graph convolutional network to predict the EV charging demand at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Specifically, we first learned the spatial correlations between charging regions by constructing heterogeneous graphs, i.e., a geographic graph and a demand graph. Then, we used graph convolutional layers and gated recurrent units to extract spatio-temporal features in the observations. Further, we designed a region-specific prediction module that grouped regions based on graph embedding and point of interest (POI) data for prediction. We used a large real-world GPS dataset which contained over 76,000 private EVs in Beijing for model training and validation. The results showed that, compared with recently popular spatio-temporal prediction methods, the proposed model had superior prediction accuracy and steady performance at different scales of regions. In addition, we conducted ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity tests. The results suggested that incorporating the demand graph and geographic graph could help improve model performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.trc.2023.104205,2023,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104205,11,high
maybe,,Eco-environmental operation of energy hub considering uncertainties of supply/demand-side resources with introducing a novel optimization algorithm,"In this paper, the optimal operation of Energy hub (EH) based upon both demand and renewable energy resources (RESs) uncertainties is investigated. Here, an innovative scenario-based energy hub energy management system (EH-EMS) is proposed for simultaneous cost and emission reduction considering the abovementioned uncertainties. Moreover, a multi objective hybrid heuristic algorithm, the so-called hBES-MOGWO, is introduced for solving the proposed EH-EMS, which is a combination of bald eagle search (BES) and multi objective gray wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithms. The proposed EH consists of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), boiler, heat storage (HS),combined heat and power (CHP) and multi-carrier energy storage technology such as power to gas (PtG) technology, electric vehicles and heat storages. Flexible loads are also taken into account for reducing cost and emission by participation in demand response programs (DRPs). The optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hBES-MOGWO algorithm. The simulation results illustrated that the total cost of EH-EMS can be effectively reduced by installing energy storage systems and implementing DRPs. The results emphasize that considering uncertainties can lead to increase the operating costs and emission, while flexible loads participation in DRPs and PtG can reduce the aforementioned ones. © 2023 The Authors.

Two system configurations, (1) PV-EV and (2) PV-BES-EV, are investigated for optimal sizing of PV and BES by creating new rule-based home energy management systems. The uncertainties of EV availability (arrival and departure times) and its initial state of charge, when arrives home, are incorporated using stochastic functions. The effect of popular EV models in the market is investigated on the optimal sizing and electricity cost of the customers. Several sensitivity analyses are adopted based on variations in the grid constrains, retail price and feed in tariff. Uncertainty analysis is provided based on the variations of insolation, temperature, and load to approve the optimal results of the developed model. A practical guideline is presented for residential customers in a typical grid-connected household to select the optimal capacity of PV or PV-BES system considering the model of EV. While the proposed optimization model is general and can be used for various case studies, real annual data of solar insolation, temperature, household's load, electricity prices, as well as PV and BES market data are used for an Australian case study.

There is also significant increase in load that may come in the form of electric vehicles (EV) charging and hydrogen requirement for decarbonization of other sectors. While there is a growing literature around long-term decarbonization strategies, there is still ample room for a practical methodology to rigorously test capacity plans to include a range of options inter alia re- optimization of the mix of renewable technologies, better coordination of the (EV) load from a system perspective, or augmenting the plan with battery energy storage (BESS) and hydrogen. This paper presents our research on EV load and green hydrogen modeling including how they can be integrated into long-term electricity models. We also present a methodology that allows planners to undertake a rigorous assessment that can be readily implemented using the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM). The application of the model is illustrated through a case study for Turkey (Türkiye) for 2050. The case study shows how an incumbent policy-driven capacity plan for 2050 that included 33% contribution from variable renewable energy (VRE) may be prone to unserved energy risk during winter months due to seasonal variability of VRE.

This study deeply researches microgrid and electric vehicles. A grid-connectedmicrogrid power optimization management model is established, and an adaptive crossover multi particle swarm optimization (ACM-PSO) is proposed, which can adjust and operate individually. The proposed algorithm introduces individual adjustment operation and considers the start and stop state of the micro power supply. Besides, it does not need to decompose the unit commitment problem into two levels of optimization problems, which reduces the complexity of the optimization problem. A-PSO algorithm is prone to fall into local optimum. This problem can be avoided and its global search ability can be improved by introducing the crossover operation of ACM-PSO.

These lanes allow EVs to recharge their batteries and compensate for the energy consumed during their motion. Nevertheless, the high deployment and operational costs of WCLs raise concerns about their expected utilization and returns on the investment. This calls for a detailed analysis of the potential locations for WCL implementation. This work proposes a two-staged multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) framework that integrates the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) with binary goal programming (BGP), to evaluate potential locations for WCL implementation according to geospatial, environmental, technical and economic criteria. In the first stage, the TOPSIS method is utilized to rank several alternative locations according to their geospatial, environmental and technical specifications. The alternatives with the highest ranking are then shortlisted and evaluated using a mathematical BGP model, to provide recommendations on the most optimal locations and the corresponding WCL lengths that meet budget constraints according to the economic evaluation criteria.

In particular, coordinated operations of AVs can potentially enhance the quality of public services, e.g., logistic and AV charging services. However, the joint logistic and AV charging scenario involves the sophisticated interactions between a large number of complicated agents, dynamic logistics, and electricity prices in real-world systems. Since AVs are individuals owned by different parties, the design of attractive incentive to motivate them to provide multiple public services becomes a fundamental issue. In this article, we develop an urban intelligent system (UIS) by exploiting the efficient incentive mechanisms, e.g., noncooperative and cooperative game-theoretic approaches, to motivate the AVs to provide logistic and charging services in UIS. For the noncooperative game approach, we formulate the interaction between the selfish AVs and the aggregator as a Stackelberg game. Meanwhile, the aggregator, known as the leader in the game, aims to decide the logistic and electricity trading prices, and then the AVs, executed as the followers, determine their service schedules. Furthermore, considering that all the players are willing to cooperate, we develop a cooperative potential game for the selfless AVs to maximize the social welfare of the UIS. These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of proposed incentive mechanisms that can motivate EVs to provide high-quality logistic and charging services by maximizing their utilities.

However, they often have incomplete knowledge of EV presence in their network. Identifying EV customers (charging at home) using smart meter data is a nontrivial task for the grid network and energy scheduling. The difficulties include recognizing charging patterns, balancing the number of EV and non-EV customers during modeling, and building an efficient classification model. In this article, we propose a periodic pattern recognition method to extract useful EV charging patterns. Real world smart meter datasets are unbalanced with few EVs and majority of energy customers are those without EVs. We improve Kmedoids evaluated by dynamic time warping to obtain the representative non-EV training samples so that balanced samples over EV and non-EV customers can be obtained.

Two scalable optimization approaches are presented to address the high computation time requirement of the proposed centralized DRO-based MPC method through the reduction of constraints: i) a robust optimization method including a distributionally robust bound on the uncertainties, and ii) a bi-level optimization method that determines critical buses associated with voltage violations. Furthermore, to preserve data privacy of electric vehicles, the centralized DRO-based MPC problem is transformed through an alternating direction multiplier method into a decentralized DRO-based MPC problem comprising the DSO and CSO problems.

maybe,,Analysis of Smart Grid Optimal Scheduling considering the Demand Response of Different EV Owners,"The escalating growth of electric vehicle (EV) load has emphasized the growing importance of effective scheduling strategies. Due to the discrepancies among EV owners, their responses to scheduling can differ significantly. Therefore, to achieve better scheduling results, it is crucial to consider the impact of these discrepancies on the optimal scheduling. This paper proposes a classified scheduling method for different types of EV owners. According to charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) data of EV owners, the K-means clustering algorithm (K-means) is used to classify EV owners, and the demand response (DR) model is established based on the classification results. The DR model is designed to account for the diverse responses of different EV owners, and the price elasticity, time gap elasticity, and preference time elasticity are important factors in the model. This paper adopts the maximization of smart grid's revenue as the optimization objective through three approaches: (1) modifying the charging and V2G of EV; (2) obtaining V2G prices for all types of EV; and then (3) adjusting the power output of each unit. To evaluate the proposed method, the IEEE 10-unit system is employed for simulation, and the optimization problem is solved using the CPLEX solver.

With the development of the modeling method, a number of methods based on probabilistic models are applied to generate scenarios. Model-based methods are often difficult to scale or sample. Data-driven technologies use a large number of data to mine the mapping relationships, instead of explicitly specifying a model. In this paper, we proposed a data-driven approach to generate scenarios using generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn the distribution of the charging current of EVs and obtain more abundant scenarios. The proposed method is applied to time-series data from the charging current dataset of EVs. Firstly, the K-Means clustering algorithm is used to preprocess the data to divide the distribution of charging current into four areas. Then, aiming to improve the training speed, GANs with gradient penalty (GP) is used for the generation of EV scenarios, which can use the GP term to optimize the Lipschitz limit. Finally, statistical methods are applied to estimate the quality of the generated data.

Defining unit commitment problem in a competitive environment to maximize the profit of GENCOs while satisfying all the network constraints is called Profit Based Unit Commitment problem (PBUC). The main contribution of this paper is modeling and inclusion of Market Clearing Price (MCP) in PBUC problem. In Day market, MCP is determined by market operator which provides maximum social welfare for both GENCOs and Consumers.On other hand this paper proposes a novel combination of solution methodology: Improved Pre-prepared power demand (IPPD) table and Analytical Hierarchy method (AHP) for solving the optimal day ahead scheduling problem as an another contribution. In this method, the status of unit commitment is obtained by IPPD table and AHP provides an optimal solution to PBUC problem. Minimizing total operating cost of thermal units to provide maximum profit to GENCOs is called an optimal day ahead scheduling problem.

Therefore, the intermittency in the power system transmits to the gas system through the gas-fired power plants, which makes the operation of these systems even more interdependent. This study proposes a novel possibilistic model for the integrated operation of gas and power systems in the presence of electric vehicles and demand response. The model takes into account uncertainty in demand prediction and output power of wind farms, which is based on possibility and necessity theories in fuzzy logic through modeling uncertain parameters by Gaussian membership function. Moreover, a contingency analysis algorithm based on maximin optimization is developed to enhance the resiliency in the integrated operation of these systems by finding the worst-case scenario for the outage of components. The proposed model is implemented on a Belgium gas network and IEEE 24-bus electricity network. It is demonstrated that the possibilistic model allows the gas network to respond to the demand variations by providing a sufficient level of linepack within the pipelines. As a result, gas-fired power plants are supposed to commit more efficiently to cope with the intermittency of wind farms, which reduce the wind curtailment by 26%. Furthermore, it is quantified that through applying the contingency analysis algorithm in presence of demand response and electrical vehicles, the costs of operation and load shedding is reduced up to 17% and 83%, respectively. © 2020",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116284,2021,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116284,11,high

We identify six adoption scenarios that combine deployment levels of rooftop solar photovoltaic modules (PV), electric vehicle charging (EV), and battery storage in residential and commercial customers connected to representative feeders in Indiana by 2025 and 2040. Indiana is a good proxy for many U.S. states with low current DER adoption but potentially high future growth. The economic value of DER is assessed by developing capacity expansion and power flow analysis of the generation and distribution segments, respectively, under future hourly demand assumptions based on each adoption scenarios. Results for the distribution system power flow simulations show that voltage violations are relatively rare. Voltage violations can be mitigated at a very low cost using a combination of smart inverters in future rooftop PV systems and voltage adjustments in the feeder heads. Line loading issues are minimal, with only 0.2% of simulation hours showing loading levels above 100% of capacity. Generation capacity impacts are driven by unmanaged EV charging and could be mitigated with charging management.

Energy storage systems are considered effective tools to deal with the surge of charging demands brought by EV/GV and enhance energy supply reliability. Meanwhile, the coupling between power and gas distribution systems has been strengthened in recent years via gas turbines. This makes it possible and imperative to jointly optimize the configuration of electrical and gas storage systems and avoid the overinvestment commonly occurring in separate planning. To this end, this paper proposes a joint electrical and gas energy storage planning approach considering the interdependency between power-gas distribution network and transportation network. First, the semi-dynamic traffic assignment method is utilized to obtain EV/GV traffic flow and its transition between two adjacent periods. EV/GV traffic flow is directly related to EV/GV charging demands and can be further converted into their spatial–temporal distribution. Second, a novel second-order cone formulation is proposed to accurately describe the nonlinear operating characteristic of gas storage system. This can help to incorporate the constraints associated with the effective operation of gas storage systems into the planning model, while ensuring the computational tractability. Finally, the proposed planning problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming problem. A penalty convex-concave procedure algorithm is developed to ensure the exactness of all second-order cone relaxations in our proposed model.

Besides, in the context of parcel delivery deep growth related to e-commerce, electric vehicle is becoming an alternative to conventional fossil fuel technology. Intrinsically, the charging process implies the interdependence between the transportation and electric power systems. This paper presents a new multistage optimization-based approach that allows linking delivery routing and aggregated demand management in the transportation and electric power systems, respectively. For the routing and charging of each independent electric vehicle, battery degradation, acceleration- and speed-dependent power consumption, penalty for delivery delay, tolls, fixed charging prices and incentives for availability time are considered. An electric vehicle demand aggregator is used to guarantee the synergy between systems. Incentives are included to motivate electric vehicles to remain at charging intersections. However, attractive incentives can create electric power system congestion due to simultaneous charges on nodes. Thus, an iterative decongestion methodology is developed. The resulting model is divided into three stages: delivery allocation, delivery routing for each independent electric vehicle and optimal energy management by electric vehicle demand aggregator. The resulting optimization problem is cast as a mixed-integer linear programming model for the first two stages and a linear programming model for the third stage.

Hence, this paper presents the probabilistic planning of distributed generations (DGs) and switched capacitive bank (SCB) constrained to the securable-reliable operation (SRO) strategy in reconfigurable SDN. The scheme is formulated as a four-objective optimization problem to simultaneously model the economic, operation, reliability, and security indices of SDN. So that the first to fourth objective minimize the total planning cost and expected operation cost, voltage deviation function (VDF), expected energy not-supplied (EENS), and voltage security index (VSI). It is limited to the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equations, planning and operation model of DG and SCB, formulation of demand response program (DRP), SDN reconfiguration constraints, reliability and voltage security limits.

maybe,,Evaluating the effect of electric vehicle parking lots in transmission-constrained AC unit commitment under a hybrid IGDT-stochastic approach,"Power network operators have recently faced new challenges due to an increase in the penetration of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources in power grids. Incorporating emerging flexible resources like electric vehicle parking lots (EVPLs) and demand response programs (DRPs) into power systems, could be a good solution to deal with inherent uncertainties imposed by these resources to the power grid. EVPLs can improve power system operating conditions by active and reactive power injection capabilities. The participation of consumers in DRPs can also improve energy consumption management by decreasing or shifting loads to other periods. This paper proposes a hybrid information gap decision theory (IGDT)- stochastic method to solve a transmission-constrained AC unit commitment model integrated with electric vehicle (EV), incentive-based DRP, and wind energy. The behavioural uncertainty related to EV owners is modelled using a scenario-based method. Additionally, an IGDT method is applied to manage wind energy uncertainty under a two-level optimization model. Verification of the proposed model is done under several case studies. Based on the results achieved, the proposed risk-based hybrid model allows the operator to differentiate between the risk level of existing uncertainties and apply a high-flexibility decision-making model to deal with such difficulties. Additionally, the role of the aforementioned flexible resources in the reduction of power system running costs and wind power uncertainty handling are evaluated.

maybe,,Assessment of the impact of a fully electrified postal fleet for urban freight transportation,"The progressive electrification of urban distribution fleets, motivated by the consolidation of electric vehicle technology and by the mobility advantages that cities grant to non-polluting vehicles, poses future challenges that affect electrical distribution networks. This paper simulates the main last mile distribution models that can be adopted in a mega-city such as Madrid. In particular, the impact of carrying out the full load of the last mile distribution by means of electric vehicles is analyzed. Two fundamental aspects are studied, the efficiency of the different routes developed by each transport vehicle and the impact that these routes have in the electrical distribution network. For this purpose, an intelligent route planner, capable of optimizing the distribution of the load among the number of vehicles available in each postal service hub (PSH), is combined with a Reference Network Model that designs and expands the distribution network to supply consumers and electric vehicles. Several scenarios in terms of location and segmentation of postal service hubs are analyzed. From this analysis, it is concluded that reinforcements on the distribution network are avoided if the operation is decentralized (using fourteen PSHs), since a centralized operation (a single PSH) would require longer routes with higher energy consumption. Moreover, decentralized operation would enhance the emissions reduction achieved by electrifying the fleet, since the estimated absolute emissions of the electrified fleet for a decentralized scenario are up to 50% lower compared to a centralized one. Finally, the results reveal that smart charging strategies also contribute to lessen the incremental costs in the distribution network, in addition to significantly reducing the cost of energy supply. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijepes.2021.106770,2021,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2021.106770,11,high
maybe,,Joint planning for battery swap and supercharging networks with priority service queues,"Existing network planning models for electric vehicle (EV) services usually treat the battery swap and the on-board supercharging as two independent processes. This study makes an early attempt to design an EV charging network where battery swap and supercharging are jointly coordinated. The swap and supercharge processes are characterized by Erlang B and Erlang C priority queues, respectively. A strategic location-allocation model is formulated to optimize the station sites, battery stock level, and the number of superchargers at chosen sites. Three design criteria, namely, battery state-of-charge, maximum service time, and power grid constraint, are simultaneously taken into account. Meta-heuristics algorithms incorporating Tabu search are developed to tackle the proposed non-linear mixed integer optimization model. Computational results on randomly generated instances show that the priority battery service scheme outperforms the pure battery swap station in terms of spare battery investment cost and charging flexibility. The case study on a real-world traffic network comprised of 0.714 million households further shows the efficacy and advantage of the dual battery charging process for ensuring state-of-charge, service time commitment, and network-wide grid stability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.108009,2021,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.108009,11,high

Here, we developed a cross-sector, high-resolution assessment model to quantify optimal energy structures on provincial bases for different years. Hourly power system simulations for all provinces for a full year are incorporated on the basis of comprehensive grid data to quantify the renewable balancing costs. Results indicate that the conventional strategy of employing local wind, solar, and storage to realize 80% renewable penetration by 2050 would incur a formidable decarbonization cost of $27/ton despite lower levelized costs for renewables. Coordinated deployment of renewables, ultra-high-voltage transmissions, storages, Power-to-gas and slow-charging electric vehicles can reduce this carbon abatement cost to as low as $−25/ton.

However, aircraft power system configuration and power distribution strategies should be reasonably designed to enable this benefit. This paper is the first attempt to investigate the optimal energy storage system sizing and power distribution strategies for electric aircraft with hybrid FC and battery propulsion systems. First, a novel integrated energy management and parameter sizing (IEMPS) framework is established to co-design aircraft hardware and control algorithms. Under the IEMPS framework, a new real-time power distribution algorithm with a flexible ratio is established to facilitate integrated parameter optimization, which can adapt to different power system configurations. Based on the comprehensive analysis of hydrogen economy, FC aging cost, and aircraft stability, a multi-objective parameter optimization model is established to decide the size of aircraft energy storage systems and hyper-parameters in the power controller.

Output power of this technology, similar to other types of RES, suffers from intermittency, while it is still more predictable in comparison to other technologies of RESs. Besides, energy storage systems (ESS) are introduced as a pivotal technology for dealing with the intermittent and non-dispatchable characteristics of IHS through spatio-temporal arbitrage.

Since PEV FCSs are used simultaneously by a large number of PEVs, they can cause negative effects on electrical networks, including increased losses and voltage deviations. Therefore, optimal siting and sizing of these stations to decrease their negative effects on electrical networks is one of the main challenges in the extensive use of PEVs. In this paper, optimal location and capacity of FCSs and renewable energy sources (RES) are simultaneously determined, while deviation paths and uncertainties of RESs are considered. For this purpose, first a capacitated deviation ﬂow refueling location model (CDFRLM) is proposed to cover the charging demand for PEVs on the transport network. Then, the desired problem is modeled based on the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which can be solved using commercially available softwares. The proposed model is implemented on 14-bus and 33-bus distribution test systems which are coupled with a 25-node transportation network.

Natural gas storage is incorporated into the problem to support the gas network during peak natural gas demand hours by reducing pipeline congestion. Moreover, integrating hydrogen energy storage (HES) along with new flexible technologies, such as power to gas (P2G) system and demand response program (DRP) is proven to reduce total operation cost by facilitating renewable energy dispatch and shifting peak load demand to off-peak hours.

With technological advances in the realm of communications and development in the infrastructure, a proper environment for the active contribution of customers has been formed. This new structure has enabled the consumers to play a vital role in the market via Demand Response Programs (DRPs) and coordinated aggregated Plug-In Electric Vehicle (PEV) fleets. These new resources could be a merit for the power system provided that they are employed correctly and in coordination with the rest of the system. The SCUC is where DRPs and PEVs could be optimally addressed to exploit their full potential. This paper tackles the problem of SCUC in the presence of DRPs and aggregated PEV fleets. The objective is to lessen the operation cost provided that all constraints are satisfied. Different constraints including those related to the system, units, transmission system, DRPs, and PEVs as well as the security constraints are taken into consideration. The SCUC is modeled as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem and an appropriate model of PEVs is derived to facilitate the integration of these resources into the grid while considering their charging and discharging characteristics as well as efficiency. Moreover, a suitable model of DRPs is introduced in this study based on the concept of price elasticity of demand. The proposed approach is practiced over the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System (RTS) to analyze the effect of the smart grid on SCUC. Obtained results demonstrate that with proper deployment of DRPs and PEVs the operation cost could be lessened while the security of the system is improved. © 2020",10.1016/j.segan.2020.100414,2021,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2020.100414,11,high

This is important because understanding the diversity between consumers is necessary to accurately estimate the number of electric vehicles’ charging a distribution network could support without reinforcements. The model combines readily available travel survey data with high resolution data from an electric vehicle trial, using clustering and conditional probabilities. We demonstrate through a case study of UK residential charging that existing approaches may overestimate the increase in peak distribution network demand by 50%, which has implications for assessing the cost of network investments required.

The proposed strategy meets various constraints such as, properly locating CSs in the city, considering traffic volume, taking the shortest route, reducing charging waiting time, limits of bus voltages, power balance, the permissible loading of lines. The travel comfort index corresponds to a situation in which the driver does not experience a depleted battery and successfully finish the trip. Since the movement of vehicles over the course of a day does not follow any particular pattern, unscented transformation is used to investigate the uncertainty in different probabilistic parameters of EVs. Moreover, by clustering the locations of EVs, the optimal locations of EV CSs are determined over the course of the day (in several time steps) using a multi-objective function based on a GA.

The VPP determines internal prices applied to the DERA by evaluating its real-time responses to the day-ahead schedule and updating proposed pricing function parameters, and the DERA adjusts its energy reserves. By repeating this coordination process, the VPP can establish an optimal operation strategy to manage real-time uncertainty on the DERA's own. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by identifying a capability of the DERA to cope with real-time fluctuation through scenario-based simulations.

In this paper, power system analysis is performed through electric vehicle charging demand and wind power outputs prediction, and an electric vehicle charging decentralization algorithm is proposed to mitigate system congestion. In order to predict electric vehicle charging demand, the measurement data were analyzed, and random sampling was performed by applying the weight of charging frequency for each season and time. In addition, wind power outputs prediction was performed using the ARIMAX model. Input variables are wind power measurement data and additional explanatory variables (wind speed). Wind power outputs prediction error (absolute average error) is about 9.6%, which means that the prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm is high. A practical power system analysis was performed for the scenario in which electric vehicle charging is expected to be higher than the wind power generation due to the concentration of electric vehicle charging.

maybe,,Power-Sensitivities-Based Indirect Voltage Control of Renewable Energy Generators With Power Constraints,"Recently, renewable energy has received considerable attention worldwide due to environmental problems such as climate change. However, there are still many problems to be solved to increase the penetration level of renewable energy sources in a power system. Above all, a power system with a high renewable penetration level requires an entirely novel operational strategy and control approach to achieve reliable operation by considering the intermittency of variable renewable energy sources. This paper proposes power-sensitivities-based indirect voltage control of renewable energy generators with power constraints. The proposed method realizes seamless control of the voltage by compensating with the reactive power if the real power of the distributed generator (DG) is insufficient due to its intermittency. To achieve the proposed method, the real and reactive power references of DGs are initially operated based on the power sensitivities between generation and loads if all the DGs operate within the power constraints. However, if at least one of the DGs reaches its constraint limit, the references can be modified using other sensitivities between real and reactive power generation enabling indirect voltage control of DGs. Therefore, a high level of renewable penetration in power systems can be accomplished with the proposed method. The proposed method is verified with several case studies that are based on a microgrid with practical data from a real island power system.

However, EV charging may also impose significant investment requirement for the power system that needs to be analyzed carefully including the capacity of the existing distribution network system, investments needed in solar PV together with battery storage and additional diesel capacity to meet the incremental demand from EVs. We explore an EV adoption scenario for Maldives for 2030 with 30% of all vehicles including two-wheelers that dominate the transport on the island under two different charging regimes: uncoordinated and optimized coordinated mode. The latter is achieved through a system wide optimization using a modified version of the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM) that optimizes charging load subject to a range of constraints on allowable timing for different categories of vehicles. If charging from the fleet is uncoordinated, a relatively small increase in energy requirement of 3.1% due to EV may lead to a 26.1% increase in generation capacity requirement and hence 15.7% additional investment. While the optimized charging regime helps to drastically cut down on generation capacity requirements to just 1.8% increase and also considerably eases feeder loading, it may also lead to higher emissions as more EV load during off-peak hours lead to an increase in diesel-based generation. We have therefore explored an additional scenario wherein the annual emissions from the power sector are constrained to the baseline (“No EV”) scenario. The analysis shows the importance of focused modeling analysis to understand the ramifications of EV load impact on the power system including significant increase in generation capacity and potential increase in power sector emissions in a fossil-fuel dominated system.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111001,2021,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2021.3111001,11,high

The integration of EVCSs in the modern distribution network characterized by increased penetration of randomly distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems is challenging as they can lead to excessive power losses and voltage deviations beyond acceptable limits. In this paper, a hybrid bacterial foraging optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization (BFOA-PSO) technique is proposed for the optimal placement of EVCSs into the distribution network with high penetration of randomly distributed rooftop PV systems. The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective problem minimizing active and reactive power losses, average voltage deviation index, and maximizing voltage stability index. The IEEE 69 node distribution network is used as the case network. The simulation is done using MATLAB to integrate the EVCSs in five cases of randomly sized and placed PV systems in the distribution network. For all five cases, a minimal increase in power losses is recorded with minor changes in the voltage deviation and stability indices due to the placement of the EVCSs. But for the voltages of nodes 29 to 48, the other node voltages remain unchanged upon placement of the EVCSs. The largest increase in power losses due to the EVCSs being brought into the network with PVs was noticed in case 3 (from 142.27kW, and 62.90kVar to 147.65kW, and 72.48kVar).",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3112847,2021,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2021.3112847,11,high

Although Blockchain offers magnificent decentralized solutions, the central management of DSOs still plays a significant, non-negligible role, owing to the reality of the existing grid structure. Numerous related studies of proposed blockchain-based EV systems have investigated the energy costs of EVs, fast and efficient charging, privacy and security, P2P energy trading, sharing economy, the selection of appropriate CFUs location, and scheduling. However, cooperation with DSO organizations has not been adequately addressed. Blockchain-based solutions mainly suggest an entirely distributed and decentralized approach for energy trading; however, converting the entire power system infrastructure is considerably expensive. Building a thoroughly decentralized electricity network in a short time is nearly impossible, particularly at the national grid level. In this regard, the applicability of the solutions is as significant as their appropriateness, especially from the DSO perspective, and must be examined closely.

With the rising demand for EVs and fast-charging stations (FCSs), the installation of renewable-based distributed generators (DGs) can further defer network upgrades and minimize energy losses. In this article, a new planning model is proposed to site and size FCSs and wind-based DGs, taking into account the stochastic nature of FCSs, residential EV loads, and renewable generation. The proposed planning model considers different cost and revenue components associated with FCSs and wind-based DGs. A typical distribution network is overlaid on a geographic map to illustrate how the network is connected with the municipal layout, thus taking into account practical constraints for installing FCSs and DGs in the vicinity of each bus. A novel scoring scheme that considers practical geographical aspects is developed to quantify the attractiveness of FCS candidate locations to the drivers of EVs.

The advantages are that they include complimentary technologies with both high power and energy capabilities. HESS have the potential to be useful to the bulk power systems, for example to increase the value of energy produced by variable generation resource through enabling participation in ancillary service markets. Actualizing the benefits of HESSs requires optimizing the combined ramping capability of aggregated HESS resources. To provide quality ancillary service, source of HESSs locating at multiple sites of variable generation resource must be optimally sized and cohesively controlled. Optimizing aggregated resources can be formulated as an optimization problem.

maybe,,Bilinear Pairing-Based Hybrid Signcryption for Secure Heterogeneous Vehicular Communications,"Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) enable vehicles to exchange safety information with the surrounding vehicles and infrastructure in order to ensure safety and efficiency in traffic management. Recently however, vehicles come from different manufacturers and therefore use different protocols for the transmission of messages. As a result, communication among vehicles become heterogeneous. Because of this, VANETs face problems related to security and performance. To address this, some heterogeneous vehicular communication-based schemes have been proposed. However, they do not perform well because of an increase in computational overhead. In order to resolve this, we propose a certificateless cryptosystem (CLC) and public key infrastructure (PKI)-based conditional privacy-preserving hybrid signcryption (CP-CPPHSC) scheme. This scheme utilizes bilinear pairings and provides security requirements in a single logical step. Through the CP-CPPHSC scheme, a message is transmitted by a vehicle using the CLC to a vehicle using the PKI. Additionally, the CP-CPPHSC scheme supports the batch unsigncryption method which helps a vehicle to unsigncrypt more than one messages simultaneously. In the random oracle model (ROM), our scheme ensures existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) with respect to a hardness assumption of q-strong Diffie-Hellman (q-SDH) and modified inverse computational Diffie-Hellman (mICDH) problems and indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) with respect to a hardness assumption of q-bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion (q-BDHI) problem.

The diminishing conventional energy resources and their adverse environmental impacts compelled the researchers and industries to move towards the nonconventional energy resources. Consequently, a drastic paradigm shift is observed in the power and transportation sectors from the traditional fossil fuel based to the renewable energy-based technologies. Considering the proliferation of electric vehicles, the energy companies have been working continuously to extend electric vehicle charging facilities. Problem. Down the line, the inclusion of electric vehicle charging stations to the electric grid upsurges the complication as charging demands are random in nature all over the grid, and in turn, an unplanned electric vehicle charging station installation may cause for the system profile degradation. Purpose To mitigate the problem, optimum allocation of the charging stations in existing power distribution system in a strategic manner is a matter of pronounced importance in maintaining the system stability and power quality. In this paper, optimum allocation of electric vehicle charging stations in IEEE 15-bus system is studied in order to minimize the highest over and under voltage deviations. Methodology. Primarily, voltage stability analysis is carried out for identification of the suitable system nodes for the integration. Voltage sensitivity indices of all the system nodes are calculated by introducing an incremental change in reactive power injection and noting down the corresponding change in node voltage for all nodes. Henceforth, dynamic load-flow analysis is performed using a fast and efficient power flow analysis technique while using particle swarm optimization method in finding the optimal locations. Results. The results obtained by the application of the mentioned techniques on IEEE 15-bus system not only give the optimum feasible locations of the electric vehicle charging stations, but also provide the maximum number of such charging stations of stipulated sizes which can be incorporated while maintaining the voltage profile.

In general, a holistic multi-level systemic view is required on the future enabling technologies, control and management meth-ods, operation and planning principles, regulation as well as market and business models. Increasing integration of intermittent renewable generation and electric vehicles, as well as industry elec-trification during the evolution, requires a huge amount of flexibility services at multiple time scales and from different voltage levels, resources, and sectors. Active use of distribution network‐con-nected flexible energy resources for flexibility services provision through new marketplaces will also be needed. Therefore, increased collaboration between system operators in operation and planning of the future power system will also become essential during the evolution. In addition, use of integrated cyber‐secure, resilient, cost‐efficient, and advanced communication technologies and solutions will be of key importance. This paper describes a potential three‐stage evolution path toward fully flexible, resilient, and digitalized electricity distribution networks. A special focus of this paper is the evolution and development of adaptive control and management methods as well as compat-ible collaborative market schemes that can enable the improved provision of flexibility services by distribution network‐connected flexible energy resources for local (distribution system operator) and system‐wide (transmission system operator) needs. © 2021 by the authors.

Within the synchronous area of continental Europe, flexible generators and loads can provide Frequency Containment Reserve and Frequency Restoration Reserve marketed through the balancing markets. The Transmission System Operators use these flexibilities to maintain or restore the grid frequency when there are deviations. This paper shows the future flexibility potential of Germany’s household sector, in particular for single-family and twin homes in 2025 and 2030 with the assumption that households primarily optimize their self-consumption. The primary focus is directed to the flexibility potential of Electric Vehicles, Heat Pumps, Photovoltaics and Battery Storage Systems. A total of 10 different household system configurations were considered and combined in a weighted average based on the scenario framework of the German Grid Development Plan. The household generation, consumption and storage units were simulated in a mixed-integer linear programming model to create the time series for the self-consumption optimized households. This solved the unit commitment problem for each of the decentralized households in their individual configurations. Finally, the individual household flexibilities were evaluated and then aggregated to a Germany-wide flexibility profile for single-family and twin homes. The results indicate that the household sector can contribute significantly to system stabilization with an average potential of 30 GW negative and 3 GW positive flexibility in 2025. In 2030, the corresponding flexibilities potentially increase to 90 GW and 30 GW, respectively.

The planning of the distribution network in RAs needs to consider the orderly charging load of EVs. In the current study, an orderly charging planning method for the charging posts and distribution network of RAs was proposed. First, a charging load forecasting model based on the travel characteristics, charging time, and ownership of EVs in RAs was established. Then, a hierarchical orderly charging optimization method, including a distribution network layer and EV access node layer, was devised. The upper layer optimizes the distribution network. The objective function is the minimum variance of the overall load in the RA and the constraint conditions satisfy the overall charging load demand and the capacity of the distributed network. The lower layer optimizes the EV access nodes. The objective function is the minimum variance of the node access load, and the constraint conditions are to meet the regional charging load demand and the optimal power balance demand transmitted from the upper layer to the lower layer.

maybe,,Energy Management Method for Fast-Charging Stations with the Energy Storage System to Alleviate the Voltage Problem of the Observation Node,"Large-scale fast charging of electric vehicles (EVs) probably causes voltage deviation problems in the distribution network. Installing energy storage systems (ESSs) in the fast-charging stations (FCSs) and formulating appropriate active power plans for ESSs is an effective way to reduce the local voltage deviation problem. Some deterministic centralized strategies used for ESSs at FCSs are proposed to solve the voltage deviation problem mentioned above. However, the randomness of the EV load is very large, which can probably reduce the effects of deterministic centralized strategies. A fast and reliable centralized strategy considering the randomness of the EV load for ESSs is a key requirement. Therefore, we propose in this paper a day-ahead scheduling strategy with the aim of maximizing the probability of the nodal voltage change being smaller than a preset limit at the observation node. In the proposed strategy, the uncertainty of EV load is taken into account and the probability of the voltage change of an observation node is quantified by a proposed analytic assessment model (AMM). Furthermore, a voltage change optimization model (VCOM) based on a novel control parameter b is proposed, where b can be used as a constraint to suppress the nodal voltage change at the observation node.

We identify six adoption scenarios that combine deployment levels of rooftop solar photovoltaic modules (PV), electric vehicle charging (EV), and battery storage in residential and commercial customers connected to representative feeders in Indiana by 2025 and 2040. Indiana is a good proxy for many U.S. states with low current DER adoption but potentially high future growth. The economic value of DER is assessed by developing capacity expansion and power flow analysis of the generation and distribution segments, respectively, under future hourly demand assumptions based on each adoption scenarios. Results for the distribution system power flow simulations show that voltage violations are relatively rare. Voltage violations can be mitigated at a very low cost using a combination of smart inverters in future rooftop PV systems and voltage adjustments in the feeder heads. Line loading issues are minimal, with only 0.2% of simulation hours showing loading levels above 100% of capacity. Generation capacity impacts are driven by unmanaged EV charging and could be mitigated with charging management.

Here, we developed a cross-sector, high-resolution assessment model to quantify optimal energy structures on provincial bases for different years. Hourly power system simulations for all provinces for a full year are incorporated on the basis of comprehensive grid data to quantify the renewable balancing costs. Results indicate that the conventional strategy of employing local wind, solar, and storage to realize 80% renewable penetration by 2050 would incur a formidable decarbonization cost of $27/ton despite lower levelized costs for renewables. Coordinated deployment of renewables, ultra-high-voltage transmissions, storages, Power-to-gas and slow-charging electric vehicles can reduce this carbon abatement cost to as low as $−25/ton.

maybe,,An Evolutionary Programming Algorithm for Solving Unit Commitment Problem in Smart Grid Environment,"This paper presents a new approach to solving the unit commitment problem using Evolutionary Programming Algorithm (EPA) in smart grid environment. The objective of this paper is to find the generation scheduling such that the total operating cost can be minimized, when subjected to a variety of constraints. This also means that it is desirable to find the optimal generating unit commitment in the power system for the next H hours. This paper proposes distributed sources which includes electric vehicles and distributed generation. EPA, which happens to be a Global Optimisation technique for solving Unit Commitment Problem, operates on a system, which is designed to encode each unit’s operating schedule with regard to its minimum up/down time. In this, the unit commitment schedule is coded as a string of symbols. An initial population of parent solutions is generated at random. Here, each schedule is formed by committing all the units according to their initial status (“flat start”). Here the parents are obtained from a pre-defined set of solution’s i.e. each and every solution is adjusted to meet the requirements. Then, a random recommitment is carried out with respect to the unit’s minimum down times. The Neyveli Thermal Power Station (NTPS) Unit-II in India demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach; extensive studies have also been performed for different power systems consists of IEEE 10, 26, 34 generating units. Numerical results are shown comparing the cost solutions and computation time obtained by using the EPA and other conventional methods like Dynamic Programming, Legrangian Relaxation and Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search in reaching proper unit commitment. © 2021, Naresuan University.

maybe,,Intelligent Charging Control of Power Aggregator for Electric Vehicles Using Optimal Control,"Vehicles (EVs) have been shown to be better for the environment since they emit lesser air pollutants compared to fuel-based vehicles. High penetration of EVs in the distribution network contributes to the increment of capital investment in smart grid technologies. This is because EVs' charging operation involves a considerably high level of electricity due to the size of EVs' battery charging period. Poor scheduling of EVs charging operation will lead to an increment in electricity consumption. This will then lead to overloading of distribution network, voltage quality degradation, power loss increment, and dispatch of uneconomical energy sources. Hence, coordinated, and smart charging schemes are vital in order to reduce charging costs. This paper proposes an optimized EV battery charging and discharging scheduling model using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on three charging scenarios. The daily charging and discharging schedule of EVs are optimized using optimal control. The result shows that the proposed optimized charging and discharging scheduling model reduces the charging cost up to approximately 50\%.",,2021,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,title_intelligentchargingcontrolofpoweraggregatorforelectricvehiclesusingoptimalcontrol_2021,11,high
maybe,,Environmental impact assessment of green energy systems for power supply of electric vehicle charging station,"The Electric Vehicle (EV) as a clean alternative to Classic Vehicle that use fossil fuels is promoted as an immediate solution to improve the quality parameters of the environment related to the transport sector. The transition to clean electrified mobility must be considered from the sustainability spectrum, and the planning of a strategy related to the implementation of electric vehicles implies, from the beginning, providing clean energy conditions to go toward a green-to-green paradigm. It should be noted that the successful implementation of the “green electro mobility” concept depends heavily on the green energy supply solutions of green electric vehicle, so Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EV-CS) should be powered by electricity generation systems based on green resources. This research article has as main objective the environmental impact assessment from the perspective of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions embedded in green stand-alone energy systems and the estimation of the environmental benefits of their implementation in the power supply of EV-CS from the perspective of avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions compared to the classic electricity supply grid. The results indicate that the green energy systems represent feasible solutions for the independent energy support of electric vehicle charging stations, being able to supply electricity based on on-site available 100% alternative energy sources. Related to 1 kWh of electricity, the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions embedded in these systems represent on average 11.40% of the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the electricity supplied through the grid at European level and on average 7.10% of the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the electricity supplied through the grid worldwide. Results also show that the average price of 1kWh of electricity generated by the analyzed systems is 4.3 times higher than the average unit price of the European Union grid energy, but this indicator must be correlated with the kgCO<inf>2</inf>/kWh cost savings compared to the electricity production from classic power plants. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1002/er.5678,2020,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1002/er.5678,11,high
maybe,,Robust chance-constrained programming approach for the planning of fast-charging stations in electrified transportation networks,"In this paper, a bi-level programming model is established to address the planning issues of fast-charging stations in electrified transportation networks with the consideration of uncertain charging demands. The capacitated flow refueling location model is considered in the upper level to minimize the planning cost of fast-charging stations while the traffic assignment model is utilized in the lower level to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of plug-in electric vehicle flows over entire transportation networks. Such bi-level model unveils the inherent relationship among charging demands, electrical demands and the spatial and temporal distribution of plug-in electric vehicle flows. Robust chance constraints are formulated to characterize the service abilities of fast-charging stations under distribution-free uncertain charging demands, where the ambiguity set is constructed to estimate the potential values of the uncertainties based on their moment-based information, such that the robust chance constraints can exactly be reduced to mixed integer linear constraints. By introducing new variables, the bi-level model is then reformulated into a single-level mixed integer second-order cone programming model so as to be solved via off-the-shelf solvers, which guarantee the optimality of the solution. A case study is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed planning model, which reveals three critical factors that significantly impact the planning outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114480,2020,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114480,11,high
maybe,,Quantifying the benefits of electric vehicles on the future electricity grid in the midwestern United States,"Rising numbers of electric vehicles (EVs) along with increasing renewable electricity will create challenges for electricity grids, potentially leading to significant increases in peak load, overgeneration of renewables during low load periods, and increased ramping requirements. However, controlled EV charging could largely mitigate these issues, transforming EVs from a grid liability into a valuable asset. In this study, we model the evolution of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid, located in the midwestern United States (U.S.) with large numbers of forecasted EVs and renewable generation by the late 2030s, over the period 2019–2039. Uncontrolled charging leads to peak load increases of up to 10% or 8 GW, and exacerbated ramping requirements. In contrast, controlled charging significantly ameliorates these challenges, with unidirectional (“V1G”) charging largely avoiding peak load increases, filling valley loads and reducing ramp rates. Bidirectional (“V2G”) charging provides much larger load flexibility to dramatically reduce peak loads and ramp rates. This study investigates EV load growth in the midwestern U.S. and the impact that different types of controlled charging can have on mitigating the grid challenges presented both by large numbers of EVs and increasing levels of renewable generation. Moreover, above ~3 million EVs, V2G charging can exhibit multi-day optimization behavior and very high load flexibility, suggesting the possibility of new load planning tools extending over multiple days. Such capabilities would provide significant aid in optimally scheduling resources with a larger percentage of intermittent renewables. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115174,2020,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115174,11,high
maybe,,The influence of electric vehicle charging strategies on the sizing of electrical energy storage systems in charging hub microgrids,"Economic, ecologic, and social benefits support the rapid diffusion of grid-connected microgrids (MG). Economic feasibility still stands out as the primary goal of commercial MGs. A stationary electrical energy storage system (ESS) is often a central component of MGs, facilitating islanding and cost-effective management of main grid use. Therefore, previous research has focused on the sizing of stationary ESS. The advent of large-scale electric vehicle (EV) charging hub MGs (CHMGs) such as the one along the freeway A8 near Augsburg, Germany, profoundly changes the economically optimal capacity of stationary ESS. While it is well conceived that EVs can be aggregated and then compensated for stationary ESS, research still lacks quantifiable evidence and methodological guidance on how the charging strategy (immediate, controlled, bidirectional) influences the economically optimal capacity of the stationary ESS. To address this gap, this paper proposes a method that includes a mixed-integer linear programming model for scheduling decisions under various conceivable ESS capacities and provides scenario analyses on the EV charging strategies as well as on ESS cost. Thereby, the method thus identifies the economically optimal capacity of the ESS. The results show that in the considered CHMG near Augsburg, the stationary ESS sizing decision is relevant in all but extreme scenarios. In particular, the economically optimal stationary ESS capacity soars if more than 65% of the EVs begin to charge immediately and the storage costs falls below 150 EUR/kWh. In contrast, smaller portions of controlled charging EVs can already drastically reduce stationary ESS. Remarkably, this paper also gives quantitative evidence that investments in bidirectional charging do not to pay off in the CHMG near Augsburg. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115231,2020,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115231,11,high

The methodology considers the design features of an electric vehicle and evaluates its energy and power requirements as to fulfil a driving cycle. The work starts by weight minimizing a fuel cell taking into consideration its physical and electrochemical characteristics. Batteries and ultracapacitors are then sized according to their dynamic response features and considering specifications from commercial candidate cells, to propose an electric configuration and specify the baseline for a hybrid power plant. In order to illustrate the methodology, a crossover utility electric vehicle and a WLTC class I drive cycle are used. This work shows that by reducing the power plant size, power and energy requirements can also be minimized and the overall performance can be increased promoting fuel and costs savings. For comparison and to show the impact of weight minimization on the energy on board and cost, this work presents the energy and power required by different power plant configurations. Results showed that including ultracapacitors to the power plant offers more benefits, such as less stress on batteries, at a marginal initial cost compared to a case without ultracapacitors, where batteries should attend transients with a limited capability for energy recovery from regenerative breaking. The methodology is easily implemented and does not large computational resources providing with a power plant baseline for further design stages, such as particular energy management approaches depending on particular priorities for the developer, such as range, productivity and performance, economy and others. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.157,2020,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.157,11,high

The charging facility is modeled containing fast, intermediate, and slow speed chargers. The nominal powers of these chargers are determined. The charging station is linked to the utility grid and it is supplied by wind energy and the energy storage devices. The optimal sizing and operation of storage system are optimized. The electrical grid is strengthened by line reinforcement. The uncertainty of wind power is included and dealt by stochastic programming. The model is expressed as stochastic mixed integer linear programming and solved by GAMS toolbox. The results demonstrate that the rated powers of quick, intermediate, and slow speed chargers are optimized on 116, 84, and 52 kW, respectively. The power of quick charger is 27% more than the intermediate one and the intermediate charger needs about 38% larger power facility compared to the slow speed system. The storage system is designed with rated power equal to 133 kW and it can discharge 85% of its energy during one hour. The lines are reinforced by 183% to supply the energy demand of the charging station. The energy, network reinforcement, and charging facility cover about 70%, 15%, and 12% of total cost.

Utilizing a multi-day data sampling method, analyses of scenarios are designed to provide insights on bounds of potential BEV market under different charging opportunities, including level 2 activity charging and level 3 trip charging. Single-day data results tend to overestimate travelers’ BEV feasibility assuming that multi-day sample data provides accurate estimations. Facility utilization can be improved without affecting travelers’ charging demand under correct pricing scheme for most cost-sensitive users. Smart grid charging strategy can greatly reduce the total number of operating chargers during the same time in a day, and BEV users’ charging behaviors have minor impact on this improvement.

These variations induce steep power fluctuations on the MVDC bus, adversely impacting the stability, efficiency and power quality. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is a promising solution for mitigating these power fluctuations. Dictating the energy that the HESS components must deliver/absorb, the energy management strategy (EMS) impacts the size/capacity of the energy storage system (ESS). Based on this consideration, sizing and EMS of a battery/supercapacitor (SC) HESS are jointly optimised by using a deep reinforcement learning-based method. The proposed method splits the power between the HESS components such that while the operational constraints are satisfied, energy storage size and losses are minimised. Its features are adaptability to varying sea states, real-time implementation feasibility, while obviating the requirement for knowledge of the ship propulsion power profile.

Today, public PEV charging station utilization is typically around 15%. When un-utilized, the chargers are either idle or occupied by a fully charged PEV that has not departed. We call this “overstay.” This motivates a strategy for increasing utilization by interchanging fully charged PEVs with those waiting for service-an issue which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Thus, this article studies the PEV charging station planning problem taking strategic interchange into account. To our best understanding, this has not been studied in the literature. With interchange, the objective is to enhance the charger utilization rate and, thus, reduce the number of chargers. This potentially reduces the capital investment and operational cost. A novel power/energy aggregation model is proposed, and a chance-constrained stochastic programming planning model with interchange is developed for a public charging station to incorporate customer demand uncertainties.

maybe,,Small-Signal Stability of a DC Network Planned for Electric Vehicle Charging,"This study sets out to investigate the small-signal stability of a DC network being planned for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The aim of this investigation is to reveal how the interconnection of EVCSs may affect the stability of the DC network so as to provide general guidance for the planning of the network. An analysis based on an equivalent model clearly reveals that two key factors impact network stability when EVCSs are interconnected: 1) the dynamic interaction between an individual EVCS and the remainder of DC network; 2) the topology and parameters of the DC network. In the worst case, the integration of a large number EVCSs can result ingrowing oscillations in the DC network, which is related to the high-frequency filter oscillation modes of EVCSs. Based on the results, a computationally simple, reduced-order modal analysis method for approximately assessing the small-signal stability of a DC network, as affected by the interconnection of EVCSs, is proposed for planning. An example of the planning of a DC network for about 40 EVCSs is used to evaluate the conclusions andto demonstrate how driving factors can be considered in the planning process by using the proposed reduced-order modal analysis method.",10.1109/TSG.2020.2982431,2020,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2020.2982431,11,high
maybe,,A Graph Automorphic Approach for Placement and Sizing of Charging Stations in EV Network Considering Traffic,"This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach with automorphic grouping for the modelling, synthesis, and analysis of electric vehicle (EV) networks with charging stations (CSs) that considers the impacts of traffic. The EV charge demands are modeled by a graph where nodes are positioned at potential locations for CSs, and edges represent traffic flow between the nodes. A synchronization protocol is assumed for the network where the system states correspond to the waiting time at each node. These models are then utilized for the placement and sizing of CSs in order to limit vehicle waiting times at all stations below a desirable threshold level. The main idea is to reformulate the CS placement and sizing problems in a control framework. Moreover, a strategy for the deployment of portable charging stations (PCSs) in selected areas is introduced to further improve the quality of solutions by reducing the overshooting of waiting times during peak traffic hours. Further, the inherent symmetry of the graph, described by graph automorphisms, are leveraged to investigate the number and positions of CSs.

The first part of this two-paper series proposes a scenario-based stochastic model for the multistage joint reinforcement planning of the distribution systems and the electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The historical EV charging demand is first determined using the Markovian analysis of EV driving patterns and charging demand. A scenario matrix, based on the heuristic moment matching method, is then generated to characterize the stochastic features and correlation among historical wind and photovoltaic generation, and conventional loads and EV demands. The scenario matrix is then utilized to formulate the expansion planning framework, aiming at the minimization of the investment and operational costs. The proposed expansion plan determines the optimal construction/reinforcement of substations, EVCSs, and feeders, in addition to the placement of wind and photovoltaic generators, and capacitor banks over the multi-stage planning horizon.

Especially, the resilience aspect of the EVs is focused due to its significance for EVs during power outages. First, the stochastic load of the fast-charging station (FCS) and the resilience load of the EVs are estimated using probability distribution functions. This information is utilized to maintain the energy level in the ESS to ensure the resilience of EVs during power outages. Then, the annualized cost of the ESS is determined using the annual interest rate and lifetime of ESS components. Finally, the optimal ESS size is determined using the annualized ESS cost, penalty cost for buying power during peak hours, and penalty cost for resilience violations. Simulations along with sensitivity analysis of uncertainties (market price, arrival time of EVs, and the residual energy level of EVs), number of EVs in the FCS, and converter ratings are conducted.

maybe,,Route Planning and Power Management for PHEVs With Reinforcement Learning,"In this article, we propose a novel control scheme for route planning with power management for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). By considering the power management of PHEVs, we aim to find the route that leads to the minimum energy consumption. The scheme adopts a two-loop structure to achieve the control objective. Specifically, in the outer loop, the minimum energy consumption route is obtained by minimizing the difference between the value function of current round and the best value from all previous rounds. In the inner loop, the energy consumption index with respect to PHEV power management for each feasible route is trained with reinforcement learning (RL). Under the RL framework, a nonlinear approximator structure, which consists of an actor approximator and a critic approximator, is built to approximate control actions and energy consumption. In addition, the convergence of value function for PHEV power management in the inner loop and asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system are rigorously studied.

maybe,,Medium-term planning of vehicle-to-grid aggregators for providing frequency regulation service,"Utilization of electric vehicle battery to provide frequency regulation service in electricity markets is a technically feasible and economically attractive idea. The role of aggregators as a middleman between electric vehicle owners and the frequency regulation market has been discussed in the literature. However, the economic interaction between the aggregator and the vehicle owners on division of interests is still a missing point. In this paper, a new pricing model for aggregators of electric vehicles is proposed such that not only its profit is maximized, but also the vehicle owners have sufficient incentives to take part in the offered vehicle-to-grid program. In the proposed model, the aggregator takes into account the depreciation cost of electric vehicle batteries and the cost of net energy transaction between the electric vehicles and the grid and, then, considers these items in settling accounts with vehicle owners.

maybe,,Optimized scheduling of EV charging in solar parking lots for local peak reduction under EV demand uncertainty,"Scheduled charging offers the potential for electric vehicles (EVs) to use renewable energy more efficiently, lowering costs and improving the stability of the electricity grid. Many studies related to EV charge scheduling found in the literature assume perfect or highly accurate knowledge of energy demand for EVs expected to arrive after the scheduling is performed. However, in practice, there is always a degree of uncertainty related to future EV charging demands. In this work, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based smart charging strategy is developed, which takes this uncertainty into account, both in terms of the timing of the EV arrival as well as the magnitude of energy demand. The objective of the strategy is to reduce the peak electricity demand at an EV parking lot with PVarrays. The developed strategy is compared with both conventional EV charging as well as smart charging with an assumption of perfect knowledge of uncertain future events. The comparison reveals that the inclusion of a 24 h forecast of EV demand has a considerable effect on the improvement of the performance of the system. Further, strategies that are able to robustly consider uncertainty across many possible forecasts can reduce the peak electricity demand by as much as 39% at an office parking space. The reduction of peak electricity demand can lead to increased flexibility for system design, planning for EV charging facilities, deferral or avoidance of the upgrade of grid capacity as well as its better utilization. © 2020 by the authors.",10.3390/en13051275,2020,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en13051275,11,high
maybe,,"Community resilience-oriented optimal micro-grid capacity expansion planning: The case of totarabank eco-village, New Zealand","In the grid-tied micro-grid context, energy resilience can be defined as the time period that a local energy system can supply the critical loads during an unplanned upstream grid outage. While the role of renewable-based micro-grids in enhancing communities’ energy resilience is well-appreciated, the academic literature on the techno-economic optimisation of community-scale micro-grids lacks a quantitative decision support analysis concerning the inclusion of a minimum resilience constraint in the optimisation process. Utilising a specifically-developed, time-based resilience capacity characterisation method to quantify the sustainability of micro-grids in the face of different levels of extended grid power outages, this paper facilitates stakeholder decision-making on the trade-off between the whole-life cost of a community micro-grid system and its degree of resilience. Furthermore, this paper focuses on energy infrastructure expansion planning, aiming to analyse the importance of micro-grid reinforcement to meet new sources of electricity demand—particularly, transport electrification—in addition to the business-as-usual demand growth. Using quantitative case study evidence from the Totarabank Subdivision in New Zealand, the paper concludes that at the current feed-in-tariff rate (NZ$0.08/kWh), the life cycle profitability of resilience-oriented community micro-grid capacity reinforcement is guaranteed within a New Zealand context, though constrained by capital requirements. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the capacitor-switching voltage ripple and dc-link switching voltage ripple for the three-phase, four-wire, split capacitor inverters. Specifically, analytical formulations of the peak-to-peak and rms values of the voltage ripples are originally pointed out in this paper and determined in the case of balanced three-phase and unbalanced (two-phase and single-phase) output (ac) currents. The obtained results can help in designing the considered inverter and sizing of the dc-link capacitors. Reference is made to the sinusoidal PWM modulation and sinusoidal three-phase output currents with an almost unity power factor, representing a grid-connected application. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to thoroughly verify all the analytical developments presented in this paper.

maybe,,A hierarchical dispatch model for optimizing real-time charging and discharging strategy of electric vehicles,"Aiming at the problems related to the dispatch, decomposition, and coordination, temporal and spatial distribution, and the randomness of electric vehicles (EVs), this paper establishes a hierarchical dispatch model between EVs and the power grid to achieve energy conservation and economy optimization. The model is composed of two layers. In the upper layer, considering spatial and temporal distribution characteristics, a bi-level economic dispatch model based on traditional unit commitment for EV aggregators is established. Then, on the account of the priority considering the convenience of EV users, the lower layer proposes the charging and discharging scheduling model for aggregators. In this layer, an evaluation index system is established by analyzing the impact of EVs' declared information, which includes the declared capacity and charging duration of EVs, the sincerity degree, and the battery loss, to determine the priority of scheduling for each EV based on the entropy method. Finally, the simulation is carried out on a four-bus micro-grid system. It shows that the hierarchical dispatch model could not only obtain the dispatch plan for aggregators but also divide the strategy results of regional power grid to each EV, to determine the optimal scheduling plan for charging and discharging of the EV aggregator in each period. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

maybe,,Minimization of harmonic distortion impact due to large-scale fast charging station using Modified Lightning Search Algorithm and Pareto-Fuzzy synergistic approach,"The increased number of nonlinear loads in the distribution system has caused a significant impact on its power quality in the form of higher harmonic distortion. The fast charging station (FCS) is an example of a powerful nonlinear load that is currently being widely promoted with the aim of supporting the continuous usage of electric vehicles (EV). The most common and cheapest method to minimize harmonic impact is through the use of a passive filter. This paper presents an optimal sizing and placement of a passive filter design based on the numbers of FCS installed in the distribution system. The MATLAB/m-file platform is used to model the power system harmonic flow, passive filter, and FCS. The control strategy used to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) due to the large number of FCS is presented based on the selection of optimal location and the size of passive filters that will provide minimum THD and apparent power losses to the overall distribution system. A Modified Lightning Search Algorithm (MLSA) technique is applied with the aim of identifying the optimal solution. The Pareto-Fuzzy technique is used to obtain a better solution among nondominated solutions. From the result, the optimal placements and sizes of passive filter will be able to reduce the maximum THD and also the total losses in the distribution system, which is equipped with 17 FCS units.

New research focuses on viewing microgrids as having an active role in the system and providing additional services, such as the concept of low-carbon microgrid nodes. The paper presents a mixed integer linear programming optimization algorithm for determining the optimal size of the distributed generation unit and battery storage system based on operational savings and investment costs, as well as estimation of environmental benefits. The flexibility of the analyzed power node comes not only from its capability to store electricity in the battery banks but to optimally schedule flexible loads such as electric vehicles (EVs). Stochasticity of EV arrival and their state of charge are modeled daily and seasonally.

maybe,,Real-time renewable energy incentive system for electric vehicles using prioritization and cryptocurrency,"Significant increase in the installation and penetration of Renewable Energy Resources (RES) has raised intermittency and variability issues in the electric power grid. Solutions based on fast-response energy storage can be costly, especially when dealing with higher renewable energy penetration rate. The rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) also brings challenges to the system planning, dispatching and operation. Due to the random dynamic nature of electric vehicle charging and routing, electric vehicle load can be challenging to the power distribution operators and utilities. The bright side is that the load of EV charging is shiftable and can be leveraged to reduce the variability of renewable energy by consuming it locally. In this paper, we proposed a real-time system that incorporates the concepts of prioritization and cryptocurrency, named SMERCOIN, to incentivize electric vehicle users to collectively charge with a renewable energy-friendly schedule. The system implements a ranking scheme by giving charging priority to users with a better renewable energy usage history.

This work proposes an optimization model that addresses the generation and transmission expansion of the grid, including the facilities’ locations, upgrades, and the network's design decisions. In contrast to some other models, it is not static in time: the model considers time-dependent demand in short-term (hourly) and long-term (yearly) variations. The proposed optimization model considers energy loss, transmission substations upgrades, constraints such as demand, capacities, and more.

maybe,,The impact of PHEVs charging and network topology optimization on bulk power system reliability,"Exhausting fossil fuels and increasing environmental pollutions call for the wider deployment of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which enable the interactions of transportation and electric sectors. The extra loads for charging massive PHEVs could compromise the power system reliability and impose considerable stress on the power system. Transmission line congestions and generation capacity inadequacy could be caused under this circumstance. However, there is little literature which comprehensively studies the impact of large-scale PHEVs on the bulk power system reliability when smart grid technologies are incorporated including smart charging and flexible transmission topology control technologies. This work studies the impacts of different charging strategies and transmission network operation strategies on the bulk power system reliability with high PHEVs integration. An evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the charging load of PHEVs and shave the peak load. A network topology optimization (NTO) operation strategy is employed to lessen the transmission congestions and reduce the load curtailment. Based on the sequential Monte Carlo simulation method, these technologies are integrated into the reliability evaluation process. Numerical studies and sensitivity analysis are conducted on modified IEEE RTS-79 systems. The results verify the effectiveness of the technologies to realize the potential of existing power system infrastructures so as to relieve the stress caused by the PHEVs load, increase the available penetration of PHEVs and promote the bulk power system reliability which is meaningful for power system planning and risk management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.epsr.2018.06.002,2018,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2018.06.002,11,high
maybe,,Decomposed Newton algorithm-based three-phase power-flow for unbalanced radial distribution networks with distributed energy resources and electric vehicle demands,"This paper proposes a three-phase power-flow algorithm using graph theory, injected current, and matrix decomposition techniques for unbalanced radial distribution networks. A decomposed Newton-Raphson (DNR) method is applied to solve the set of nonlinear power equations described in polar form. Unlike conventional Newton-Raphson-based methods, the proposed DNR algorithm does not involve calculating the lower and upper triangular matrix (LU) factorization, Gaussian elimination, and inversion of the full bus admittance matrix or Jacobian matrix and building the bus impedance matrix; it also requires less computation time and has high robustness with respect to the X/R ratio and load changes. The mathematical component models, such as three-phase conductors, transformers, automatic voltage regulators (AVRs), ZIP load demands, shunt capacitors/reactors, inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicle (EV) demands can easily be integrated into the proposed algorithm by using the injected current technique. Therefore, a three-phase power-flow problem can be decomposed into three single-phase power-flow problems with individual phase representation. To validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, four three-phase IEEE test systems and a practical Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) distribution system are used for comparisons. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm has good potential for improving the computational efficiency of optimal planning and design and also real-time power dispatch applications, even for ill-conditioned distribution networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijepes.2017.09.042,2018,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2017.09.042,11,high

maybe,,Loadability analysis of DC distribution systems,"DC distribution networks and micro grids are gaining importance enabling the integration of hybrid distributed generation, energy storage units, modern loads including electric vehicles and different micro grid topologies, thus permitting the consequent development of DC Distribution Systems (DCDS). For maximum utilization of distribution network without compromising the security and reliability of the supply system, determination of critical loading is crucial. With this objective, this paper proposes a modified DC continuation power flow based approach for determining the loadability limit of the active DCDS. DC-DC converters play an important role in bus voltage regulation and system loadability. Impact of these converters must be accounted in any analysis and planning of active DCDS. In this paper, two different mathematical models of lossless DC-DC converters are developed to account them in power flow model of the system. The proposed approach can be applied to both radial and meshed DCDS.

maybe,,Benefit maximization of demand side management operator (DSMO) and private investor in a distribution network,"In this paper, the beneficial impact of private investor participation and demand side management operator (DSMO) in planning problem is investigated. All system uncertainties are modeled by fuzzy number approach. Bi-objective optimization model is proposed for the maximum benefit of DSMO and private investor in the planning horizon. To tackle the optimization problem, ε-constraint and fuzzy decision making methods are jointly used. Different scenarios are modeled including and excluding electric vehicles (EVs) charging impact on the daily load curve. The problem is formulated in the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) environment and solved by its embedded high-performance solvers. The obtained results reveal that the desired benefits of a private investor cannot be satisfied in the no benefit sharing scenario. In non-zero benefit sharing scenario, Pareto optimal front includes non-negative values for both DSMO and private investor which demonstrates the beneficial solutions. Followed by adding EVs charging load to the daily load curve, the total benefits of private investor and DSMO are reduced up to 13.33% and 30.44%, respectively. Furthermore, employing smart charge/discharge behavior increases private investor and DSMO benefits up to 32.04% and 14.76%, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.scs.2018.04.022,2018,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2018.04.022,11,high

Due to high correlation of prediction performance with related horizons and aggregated more customers, a new strategy is developed to provide a forecasting model based on high accuracy. While, consumption shape of a single users normally has low structure to be exploited and vice versa. So, combining different users develops the relative prediction performance up to special point. Outside this point, no more enhancement in relative performance can be found. This model is useful in optimal power system operation and planning in micro-grids. In this paper, besides the aggregated loads of building, the electric vehicle (EV) impact on network has been considered.

These developments urge the demand for flexibility in low voltage distribution networks, on the one hand caused by the intermittency of renewable energy sources, and on the other hand by the high power demand of battery electric vehicles and heat pumps. One of the foremost ways to create flexibility is by using energy storage systems. This paper proposes a method to first optimize the siting, power and capacity rating, technology, and operation of energy storage systems based on the technical and economic value. Secondly the method can be used to make cost- and time-based network planning decisions between network upgrades and network upgrade deferral by energy storage systems. To demonstrate the proposed method, study cases are analyzed of five low voltage distribution networks with different penetrations of photovoltaics, heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. The optimal energy storage systems in the study cases are: flow batteries sited at over 50% of the cable length with a high capacity rating per euro. With the current state of energy storage system development, network upgrade deferral is up to 61% cheaper than network upgrades in the study cases.

This study addresses this technical challenge and proposes a hierarchical planning solution for both sitting and sizing of PEV fast charging stations based on a temporal-SoC (state-of-charge) characterisation and modelling of PEV fast charging demand. The optimal sitting of fast charging stations is firstly determined to ensure minimising the total number of stations and meeting the PEV fast charging demand considering the constraints of transportation networks and the expected PEV remaining mileage. Then the sizing (number of chargers and waiting spaces) of fast charging station is optimised by the use of M/M/s/N queuing model, so as to maximise the expected profit of the operator.

The parking lot will have an important role in the smart grid as a distributed generation. Due to the output power of parking lots is uncertain, More accurate modeling of parking lot output power is necessary for the future of distribution network studies such as Distribution Network Expansion Planning (DNEP). In this paper, a systematic method based on the Z-number concept is utilized to represent the uncertainty of Vehicle to Grid's (V2G's) presence. In order to investigate the impact of V2Gs uncertainty on the DNEP, we proposed a Probabilistic-Possibilistic DNEP in the presence of V2Gs referred to as P-PDNEPV2G. If the V2Gs historical data is incomplete, the proposed structure can significantly consider the effects of V2G on the DNEP. In P-PDNEPV2G, parking lots output power is described as a probabilistic-possibilistic variable by Z-number method.

To facilitate large-scale EV applications, optimal locating and sizing of charging stations have become essential. For the investors of a charging station, economic benefit is the primary and the only objective. In this context, this work studies the siting and sizing of EV stations based on the optimal economic benefit. Benefit changes with time, location and capacity. A planning model method considering net present value (NPV) and life cycle cost (LCC) is proposed to determine the site and the size of the charging stations. The model has integrated distribution network constraint, the user constraint and the traffic flow captured constraint. Origin-destination lines and voronoi diagram are selected to calculate the traffic flow and the service region of each charging station, respectively. The quantum genetic algorithm was adopted for a better convergence of the planning model. Finally, a coupled 33-node distribution system and a 36-node transportation system are used to simulate various scenarios in the coupled networks of grid and transportation.

maybe,,Stochastic integration of demand response and reconfiguration in distribution network expansion planning,"Planning the distribution network of the future involves forecasting the most likely scenario to make appropriate investment decisions. Many uncertainties concerning, e.g. the evolution of conventional loads, renewable production and electric vehicles (EVs) make it difficult to predict the location of the distribution network's weaknesses (overvoltages, undervoltages and overcurrents) and their occurrence. In some cases, alternative solutions such as demand response (DR) and reconfiguration can remove the constraints and prevent expensive network investment. This study proposes a two-stage algorithm that is able to give the probability that no technical constraints will appear as a function of the reinforcement cost with and without using DR and/or reconfiguration. The first stage of the algorithm consists in running Monte Carlo simulations based on realistic scenarios for loads, EVs and renewable production development provided by French governmental roadmaps. The cost of reinforcement per line and per hour of constraints enables selection of the feeders, where DR (solved with linear programming) and/or reconfiguration (exhaustive research) will be implemented in the second stage of the algorithm to remove these constraints.

The study was carried out using a generation planning model combined with a unit commitment and economic dispatch model. The results from the planning model show a strong shift away from combined cycle gas turbines to open cycle gas turbines and gas engines as the share of wind power and solar photovoltaic increases. Demand side flexibility measures pushed this trend further. The results from the unit commitment and economic dispatch model demonstrate that the flexibility measures decrease the ramping frequency of thermal units, while the ramp rates of thermal units remain largely unchanged or increased. This indicates that the flexibility measures can cover smaller ramps in the net load more cost-effectively but that thermal power plants are still valuable for larger ramps.

The power consumption characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible and easily controllable, which will also affect the sizing of power generation system. This paper presents a methodology for the joint capacity optimization of a typical residential standalone microgrid (MG) employing RE sources, i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WTs), diesel generators (DGs), and battery energy storage system (BESS). The MG supplies a residential community load comprising of typical residential load plus electric vehicles (EVs) charging load. The realistic mathematical models of PV, WT, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load are formulated to improve the capacity optimization methodology, which involves various realistic constraints associated with the RE sources, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load. The labyrinthine optimization problem is formulated and solved innovatively to 1) minimize the cost; 2) reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; and 3) curtail dump energy. All three objectives have special significance in designing a standalone MG, for example, cost is related to the economics, GHG emissions deal with global warming, and dump energy is related to the stability and economics of the system. The optimization problem is solved for different possible combinations of PV, WT, DG, and BESS to determine the best possible combination to serve the load effectively and economically.

This transformation is a more complex hybrid system, with dispatchable and non-dispatchable resources, and requires novel planning and design tools to ensure the security of supply in the future. This paper presents a methodology that jointly optimizes the capacities and locations of dispatchable and non-dispatchable distributed generating units and battery energy storage system employed in a stand-alone MG serving conventional residential and electric vehicle charging load. The complex dual optimization problem is solved innovatively in two sequential steps. In the first step, the capacities of solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, battery energy storage system, and diesel generator are determined without actually considering the system design itself. While in the second step, a novel and simple methodology is developed which determines the sub-optimal capacities of distributed generation units along with their actual locations in the distribution system. To determine the optimal locations of distributed generation units, we defined a novel factor, losses-voltage-factor (LVF), which ensures reduced losses and better voltage quality.

The operator procures energy from both renewable energy sources (RESs) and the spot market. We observe the fact that the RESs may incur considerable infrastructure cost. This cost is taken into account and the optimal planning of renewables is examined by controlling the investment in RES infrastructures. Due to the uncertainty of renewables, the operator can also purchase energy directly from the spot market to compensate for the possible deficit incurred by the realization of the random renewable energy. By setting appropriate prices, the operator sells the collected energy to heterogeneous end users with different demand response characteristics. We model the decision making process of the operator as a two-stage optimization problem. The optimal decisions on the renewable deployment, energy purchase from the spot market, and pricing schemes are derived.

This flexibility promotes the EVs to be good candidates for providing the grid with ancillary services, such as regulation services. A group of EVs controlled by an aggregator can collectively work as a regulation reserve in the electric grid. However, a fast response to the regulation commands is crucial to providing reliable regulation service. Typically, the response time to the regulation command requires to be less than four seconds. In this paper, we precisely evaluate the expected time delay from the instant when an aggregator server sends a regulation command to n EVs to the instant when all the EVs' responses are received successfully by the server. To achieve this goal, first, a realistic communication structure between the aggregator server and the EVs is considered. Second, the wireless link between the access point (AP) and the EVs is accurately modeled in order to estimate the average delay. The model is based on Markov chain representation for the wireless IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. Two important factors are considered in this model. First, the packet loss probability due to the lossy wireless environment has been incorporated into the model. Second, the transition stages for the contention window size of 802.11 MAC protocol to reach the saturation stage is taken into account. The model has been validated by means of extensive simulation using the well-known Network Simulator 2 (NS2) tool. Our analysis shows that one AP is capable of handling up to 1000 EVs without violating the 4-s latency limit when the probability of packet loss is 0.01. However, this number decreases significantly, less than 500 EVs, when the wireless link is experiencing a significant packet loss probability of 0.2.

maybe,,An agent-based model for zip-code level diffusion of electric vehicles and electricity consumption in New York City,"Current power grids in many countries are not fully prepared for high electric vehicle (EV) penetration, and there is evidence that the construction of additional grid capacity is constantly outpaced by EV diffusion. If this situation continues, then it will compromise grid reliability and cause problems such as system overload, voltage and frequency fluctuations, and power losses. This is especially true for densely populated areas where the grid capacity is already strained with existing old infrastructure. The objective of this research is to identify the zip-code level electricity consumption that is associated with large-scale EV adoption in New York City, one of the most densely populated areas in the United States (U.S.). We fuse the Fisher and Pry diffusion model and Rogers model within the agent-based simulation to forecast zip-code level EV diffusion and the required energy capacity to satisfy the charging demand. The research outcomes will assist policy makers and grid operators in making better planning decisions on the locations and timing of investments during the transition to smarter grids and greener transportation. © 2018 by the authors.",10.3390/en11030640,2018,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en11030640,11,high
maybe,,Capacity optimization of a centralized charging station in joint operation with aWind farm,"In the context of large-scale wind power integration and rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs), a joint operation pattern was proposed to use a centralized charging station (CCS) to address high uncertainties incurred by wind power integration. This would directly remove the significant indeterminacy of wind power. Because the CCS is adjacent to a wind power gathering station, it could work jointly with wind farms to operate in power system as an independent enterprise. By combining the actual operational characteristics of the wind farm and the CCS, a multidimensional operating index evaluation system was created for the joint system. Based on the wind farm's known capacity, a multi-target capacity planning model was established for CCS to maximize the probability of realizing diverse indices of the system based on dependent-chance goal programming. In this model, planning and dispatching are combined to improve the feasibility of results in the operational stage. This approach takes the effects of randomness into account for wind power and battery swapping. The model was solved through combining Monte Carlo simulation and a genetic algorithm (GA) based on segmented encoding. As shown in the simulation results, the proposed model could comprehensively include factors such as initial investment, wind power price, battery life, etc., to optimize CCS capacity and to ultimately improve the operating indices of the joint system. © 2018 by the authors.",10.3390/en11051164,2018,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en11051164,11,high

Solutions based on fast-response energy storage can be costly, especially when dealing with higher renewable energy penetration rate. The rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) also brings challenges to the system planning, dispatching and operation. Due to the random dynamic nature of electric vehicle charging and routing, electric vehicle load can be challenging to the power distribution operators and utilities. The bright side is that the load of EV charging is shiftable and can be leveraged to reduce the variability of renewable energy by consuming it locally.

The extra loads for charging massive PHEVs could compromise the power system reliability and impose considerable stress on the power system. Transmission line congestions and generation capacity inadequacy could be caused under this circumstance. However, there is little literature which comprehensively studies the impact of large-scale PHEVs on the bulk power system reliability when smart grid technologies are incorporated including smart charging and flexible transmission topology control technologies. This work studies the impacts of different charging strategies and transmission network operation strategies on the bulk power system reliability with high PHEVs integration. An evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the charging load of PHEVs and shave the peak load. A network topology optimization (NTO) operation strategy is employed to lessen the transmission congestions and reduce the load curtailment. Based on the sequential Monte Carlo simulation method, these technologies are integrated into the reliability evaluation process. Numerical studies and sensitivity analysis are conducted on modified IEEE RTS-79 systems.

Besides, owing to the significant evolution of power electronic devices, there is a rapid growth in penetration of DC loads and generations, such as PV and electric vehicles (EVs), into the buildings and homes as a building block of the future smart cities. This is despite the fact that the electricity infrastructure of the conventional buildings is designed based on AC electricity and as a result, there would be a lot of losses due to the frequent power conversion from AC to DC and vice versa. Besides, according to a significant amount of energy consumption in the residential sector, buildings have a prominent role to confront environmental problems and obtain sustainability. In such circumstances, and considering the energy outlook, rethinking the electrification structure of the built environment is necessary. This work is an effort in this regard and looks for a sustainable energy infrastructure for the cyber-physical homes of the future. Three disparate electrification architectures are analyzed. The proposed framework, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, not only considers costs associated with investment and operation but also evaluates the reliability of each structure by considering the different ratios of DC loads.

Asset congestion and voltage issues need to be quantified considering both the medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) parts as well as the unbalanced nature of the problem. Since LV models are not available, this paper adopts an approach to expand existing MV-only models by incorporating pseudo-LV feeders. The EV hosting capacity is assessed by exploring multiple EV penetrations and considering their time-varying behaviour during the peak demand day (worst-case scenario). Two realistically modelled Australian MV-LV networks (urban and rural) are used as case study considering EV profiles derived from the Electric Nation project in the UK.

The first stage of the suggested framework focuses on the economic operation planning of EHS. The operator of EHS handles the uncertainty of market prices and renewable resources to provide the primary scheduling from the economic point of view. In the second stage, the primary scheduling of EHS has been modified to enhance the thermal and electrical flexibility in order to cover the existing uncertainties. Increasing system flexibility is achieved by increasing system reservation, but maximizing flexibility should not lead to a lack of energy for consumers. Therefore, the third stage evaluates the operation scheduling of EHS from the electrical and thermal energy not supplied perspective. Also, the plug-in electric vehicle, electric storage, thermal storage, ice storage, electrical and thermal demand response programs are integrated into EHS to enhance the system flexibility.

The main aim of the optimisation problem is to minimize the Cost of Electricity (COE) while satisfying the design constraints over 20-year project lifespan. Novel rule-based home energy management systems are created to investigate the optimal sizing of two system configurations: (1) SPV-EV, and (2) SPV-BSS-EV.

maybe,,A Multiport Partial Power Processing Converter With Energy Storage Integration for EV Stationary Charging,"Battery storage system (BSS) integration in the fast charging station (FCS) is becoming popular to achieve higher charging rates with peak-demand shaping possibility. However, the additional conversion stage for integrating the BSS increases the system losses, size, and cost. The concept of a partial power processing converter (PPPC) can mitigate this effect. Compared to conventional used full power processing converter (FPPC), PPPC reduces the amount of transferred power from the BSS to the electric vehicle (EV) by the converter. As a consequence, the power losses generated by the converter are reduced, leading to lower sized converters and higher system efficiencies. This article proposes a dc/dc multiport converter that allows the integration of battery storage in FCS based on a partial power processing concept while maintaining the specific requirements in terms of isolation for FCS. The proposed three-port partial power processing converter (3P-PPPC) is derived from the commonly used triple active bridge (TAB) converter. The resulting design tradeoffs, the dynamic behavior, and limitations of the topology are investigated.

Reducing energy consumption in buildings toward zero-energy buildings is a vital pillar to ensure that future climate and energy targets are reached. However, due to the high uncertainty of building loads and customer comfort demands, and extremely nonlinear building thermal characteristics, developing an effective zero-energy building energy management (BEM) technology is facing great challenges. This article proposes a novel learning-based and iterative Internet of Things (IoT) system to address these challenges to achieve the zero-energy objective in BEM of connected buildings. First, all buildings in the IoT-based BEM system share their operation data with an aggregator. Second, the aggregator uses these historical data to train a deep reinforcement learning model based on the deep deterministic policy gradient method. The learning model generates precooling or preheating control actions to achieve zero-energy BEM for building heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Third, for solving the coupling problem between HVAC systems and building internal heat gain loads, an iterative optimization algorithm is developed to integrate physics-based and learning-based models to minimize the deviation between the on-site solar photovoltaic generated energy and the actual building energy consumption by properly scheduling building loads, electric vehicle charging cycles, and the energy-storage system. Finally, the optimal load operation scheduling is generated by considering customers’ comfort requirements.

Assuming price-taking behavior, we develop a competitive equilibrium concept based on a relaxed version of the social planner's problem, which includes prices for consumption and incentives for flexibility, and allows for probabilistic allocation of power to loads. Considering each load as representative of a population of identical loads with scaled characteristics, we demonstrate that the relaxed social planner's problem gives an exact solution to the original mixed integer problem in the large population limit, and give a market mechanism for implementing the competitive equilibrium.

This paper addresses the NE seeking problem for a class of aggregative games with general directed communication graphs. To achieve this objective, two new kinds of distributed discrete-time NE seeking algorithms are developed for aggregative games over fixed digraphs and time-varying digraphs, respectively. In particular, motivated by the heavy-ball method in optimization studies, a momentum term is introduced to the update law of the players’ actions and it is numerically verified that this momentum term accelerates the convergence of the proposed algorithms.

To this end, we model the electric vehicle behavior that includes times of departure and arrival, state of charge, required energy, and its objectives, e.g., avoid battery degradation and willingness to pay. Next, we formulate the centralised day ahead distribution market which explicitly represents the physical system, supports unbalanced three phase networks with delta and wye connections, and incorporates the charging needs of electric vehicles under a uni- and a bi-directional charging scheme. The solution of the centralised market requires knowledge of electric vehicle information in terms of desired energy, departure and arrival times that electric vehicle owners are reluctant in providing. Moreover, the computational effort required to solve the day ahead distribution market in cases of numerous electric vehicles is very intensive. As such, we propose a distributed solution of the day ahead distribution market clearing mechanism over a time-varying communication network where no private information is exchanged. We also incorporate uncertainty of electric vehicle charging needs and provide guarantees on the probability of constraint satisfaction.

The idea of essential energy demand is introduced in this paper to maximize the number of EVs that are served during power contingencies. For EVs carrying out the time-critical task(s), the essential energy demand is defined as the amount of energy required by EVs to accomplish their upcoming task(s). For EVs carrying out delay-tolerant tasks, it is defined as the amount of energy required by EVs to travel to a nearby healthy charging station. To this end, an EV ranking mechanism is devised considering the full and essential energy demands along with the urgency of EVs. Subsequently, EVs with higher ranks are prioritized during energy allocation. The performance of the proposed method is compared with four existing division rules, i.e., proportional, constrained equal awards, constrained equal losses, and sequential priority rules. A utilitarianism index is proposed to analyze the performance of these methods and fairness is evaluated using existing indices, such as Jain's fairness index and cost of fairness index.

Besides, owing to the significant evolution of power electronic devices, there is a rapid growth in penetration of DC loads and generations, such as PV and electric vehicles (EVs), into the buildings and homes as a building block of the future smart cities. This is despite the fact that the electricity infrastructure of the conventional buildings is designed based on AC electricity and as a result, there would be a lot of losses due to the frequent power conversion from AC to DC and vice versa.

For this purpose, a long-term generation and transmission expansion co-optimization model is used, which captures the hourly operational dynamics of the system by means of the use of representative days. This is relevant since smart charging schemes for Electric Vehicles (EVs) are available, and their benefits are intertwined with the hourly available generation (especially solar), the level of demand, and the transmission capacity. Private and public EVs’ demand is considered through five main scenarios, which differ in the number of EVs and the charging strategies used (i.e., upon-arrival charging or smart charging). The analysis is illustrated using the Chilean power grid. The numerical results show that a massive penetration of EVs in the Chilean power generation system will heavily encourage solar power capacity investments. Furthermore, smart charging allows for an additional increase in the solar power installed, leading (in the Chilean case) to an extra 2.4% increase in solar power generation and an additional 2.5% decrease in fossil fuel-based generation, which was commonly used to offer flexibility to the system. These effects are diminished if a high-enough level of solar power is not feasible.

However, these new concerns may have an adverse effect on the complexity of the operation of the network, they present great opportunities to the network operators for a better service, in terms of lower costs and enhanced security. In this paper, the integration of the coordinated aggregated Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) fleets and Demand Response Programs (DRPs) into power systems is studied using the stochastic reliability-based Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC). The proposed SCUC program minimizes network operation costs while determining the best strategy for deployment of PEVs and DRPs. Moreover, the proposed approach analyze the effect of these resources on the adequacy of the power system by considering reliability metrics Being a mobile power storing device enables the PEVs to provide their energy to the network when called upon. Moreover, DRPs can mitigate power consumption during the peak load or in case of a contingency. Optimal integration of these resources could reduce the network operating costs and improve security. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model is employed for power system modeling in a smart grid environment.

maybe,,Using EVs as distributed energy resources for critical load restoration in resilient power distribution systems,"Owing to the important role of the power system in modern societies, its resilience against natural disasters has become a top priority for power system operators and planners. Moreover, in recent years, due to the increasing number and severity of weather-related events, several operational solutions have been proposed to increase the resilience of power systems. For instance, in the distribution part of power systems, dynamic micro-grid (MG) formation can enhance resilience by means of distributed energy resources (DERs) when the main grid is unavailable. Following this concept, the capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs) such as vehicle-to-grid make it possible to use the energy stored inside them to restore critical loads. Therefore, the aggregation of EVs in the distribution system can be seen as a DER from the system operator viewpoint, and operators can benefit from this limited energy resource in MG formation. This study uses two types of EV aggregation for this purpose, i.e. a public parking lot and a residential parking. To improve system performance when using these resources, two steps should be taken: (i) employing a master-slave control technique in each MG and (ii) using a demand-side management programme. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.",10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.1561,2020,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.1561,10,high

This demand increment, called Cold Load Pick-up (CLPU) has been a critical concern to utilities and will slow down the restoration process. Thus, it is imperative to predict the CLPU demand to perform restoration process more precisely. The use of new loads such as electric vehicles (EVs) has made new problems. In this paper, first the negative impact of EVs after an outage, on CLPU demand is investigated and then it is shown that the behavior of EVs during restoration service is the same as CLPU phenomenon. In doing so, the proposed approach uses Monte Carlo simulation method to predict EVs recharging demand. Since there will be some other new loads in the future that may have CLPU performance, a new approach is proposed to predict the CLPU demand of any load, without the need to have its exact model. ANFIS method is used to estimate CLPU demand based on previous outage cases in the feeder.

The hybrid power system considered in this work includes thermal generating units, RERs such as wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) units, battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs). Here, the two objective functions are formulated, i.e., minimization of operating cost and system risk, to develop an optimum scheduling strategy of hybrid power system. The objective of proposed approach is to minimize operating cost and system risk levels simultaneously. The operating cost minimization objective consists of costs due to thermal generators, wind farms, solar PV units, EVs, BESSs, and adjustment cost due to uncertainties in RERs and EVs. In this work, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is considered as the risk index, and it is used to quantify the risk due to intermittent nature of RERs and EVs.

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders.

Game theory is often used to provide a new solution for the optimal decision-making among multi-stakeholders. As a dynamic game, differential game can describe the dynamic changes of time-sharing electricity price (TOU price) about power grid and charging power about EV in real time. Considering the problem of “peak on top of peak” caused by a large number of electric vehicles' disordered charging, this paper makes the dispatching strategy of EVs entering the grid based on the TOU price, and establishes a dynamic differential game model for the power grid and EV decision makers. The model is solved by taking the TOU price of power grid and the charging power of EV as the strategy, and smoothing the peak valley difference of power grid and minimizes the charging cost of EV as the goal. In the end, DR for optimizing power grid load and reducing user's low cost is adopted to simulate the proposed model. The simulation results show that the peak-valley difference rate of the optimized power grid is reduced by 6.93%, and the cost of EV users is reduced by 71.52%.

maybe,,Decentralized Greedy-Based Algorithm for Smart Energy Management in Plug-in Electric Vehicle Energy Distribution Systems,"Variations in electricity tariffs arising due to stochastic demand loads on the power grids have stimulated research in finding optimal charging/discharging scheduling solutions for electric vehicles (EVs). Most of the current EV scheduling solutions are either centralized, which suffer from low reliability and high complexity, while existing decentralized solutions do not facilitate the efficient scheduling of on-move EVs in large-scale networks considering a smart energy distribution system. Motivated by smart cities applications, we consider in this paper the optimal scheduling of EVs in a geographically large-scale smart energy distribution system where EVs have the flexibility of charging/discharging at spatially-deployed smart charging stations (CSs) operated by individual aggregators. In such a scenario, we define the social welfare maximization problem as the total profit of both supply and demand sides in the form of a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. Due to the intractability, we then propose an online decentralized algorithm with low complexity which utilizes effective heuristics to forward each EV to the most profitable CS in a smart manner. Results of simulations on the IEEE 37 bus distribution network verify that the proposed algorithm improves the social welfare by about 30% on average with respect to an alternative scheduling strategy under the equal participation of EVs in charging and discharging operations. Considering the best-case performance where only EV profit maximization is concerned, our solution also achieves upto 20% improvement in flatting the final electricity load. Furthermore, the results reveal the existence of an optimal number of CSs and an optimal vehicle-to-grid penetration threshold for which the overall profit can be maximized.

To address this issue, a coordinated optimization strategy considering nighttime DPR state of units and uncertain EV demand response (DR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, unlike traditional studies, a detailed unit commitment (UC) model considering life loss and oil cost is established in this paper. After that, on the basis of elastic pricing method and day-ahead contract, price-based demand response (PDR) and incentive-based demand response (IDR) model are proposed to avoid units operating in the DPR state. The uncertainty of both IDR and PDR progress are considered as a whole in the form of opportunity constrain, and then transformed into deterministic linear constraints for solving by adopting sequence operations.

Accordingly, this paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model taking into account the traffic impacts and power line conditioning capabilities of PEVFCSs to determine optimal locations and sizes of PEVFCSs. Various load profile patterns and the variation of charging demand during the planning horizon are included in this model to consider different operation states of DN and TN.

maybe,,Value of Point-of-Load Voltage Control for Enhanced Frequency Response in Future GB Power System,"The need for Enhanced Frequency Response (EFR) is expected to increase significantly in future low-carbon Great Britain (GB) power system. One way to provide EFR is to use power electronic compensators (PECs) for point-of-load voltage control (PVC) to exploit the voltage dependence of loads. This paper investigates the techno-economic feasibility of such technology in future GB power system by quantifying the total EFR obtainable through deploying PVC in the urban domestic sector, the investment cost of the installment and the economic and environmental benefits of using PVC. The quantification is based on a stochastic domestic demand model and generic medium and low-voltage distribution networks for the urban areas of GB and a stochastic unit commitment (SUC) model with constraints for secure post-fault frequency evolution is used for the value assessment. Two future energy scenarios in the backdrop of 2030 with `smart' and `non-smart' control of electric vehicles and heat pumps, under different levels of penetration of battery energy storage system (BESS) are considered to assess the value of PEC, as well as the associated payback period.

maybe,,Towards efficient battery swapping service operation under battery heterogeneity,"The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) has posed significant challenges to the existing power grid infrastructure. It thus becomes of vital importance to efficiently manage the Electro-Mobility for large demand from EVs. Due to limited cruising range of EVs, vehicles have to make frequent stops for recharging, while long charging period is one major concern under plug-in charging. We herein leverage battery swapping (BS) technology to provide an alternative charging service, which substantially reduces the charging duration (from hours down to minutes). Concerning in practice that various battery is generally not compatible with each other, we thus introduce battery heterogeneity into the swapping service, concerning the case that different types of EVs co-exist. A battery heterogeneity-based swapping service framework is then proposed. Further with reservations for swapping service enabled, the demand load can be anticipated at BS stations as a guidance to alleviate service congestion. Therefore, potential hotspots can be avoided.

To address this problem, the present work mainly focuses on optimal integration of distributed generators (DG) into radial distribution systems in the presence of PEV loads with their charging behavior under daily load pattern including load models by considering the daily (24h) power loss and voltage improvement of the system as objectives for better system performance.Design/methodology/approachTo achieve the desired outcomes, an efficient weighted factor multi-objective function is modeled.

The need for charging stations (CSs) for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in urban and private parking areas (PAs) is becoming a relevant issue. In this scenario, the use of energy storage systems (ESSs) could be an effective solution to reduce the peak power request by CSs in PAs to the grid. Moreover, II-Life battery modules are a potential approach for cutting costs and implementing sustainable solutions. We propose a method to size ESSs coupled to CSs by using II-Life battery modules. Our methodology is based on the estimation of the residual cycles and the decrease in the supplied power due to the battery aging for defining the number of EV battery packs required for an ESS use case.

maybe,,Research on bidding mechanism for power grid with electric vehicles based on smart contract technology,"To promote coordinated development of electric vehicles (EVs) and power grid under open power selling, a bidding mechanism using blockchain smart contract technology was proposed. By demand respone management (DRM) on and off the blockchain, based on different driving characteristics of EV subgroups, various charging–discharging demands and constraints were fully considered between EV user subgroups and agent. Purchase–sale transaction relationship and unit commitment plan were fully considered between the EV agent and power dispatching center under economic dispatching. Aiming at the lowest power purchase cost of EV users, the highest profit of EV agent and the lowest cost of power economic dispatching, smart contract models with optimal benefits were established among the three. The smart contract models were solved by combining the internal and external optimization relationship of particle swarm and genetic algorithms. The charging–discharging price was optimized by DRM to realize the reasonable allocation of charging–discharging resources of EVs. An example analysis shows that this bidding mechanism can achieve peak–cutting and valley–filling for power load. At the same time, it can effectively protect the benefits of EV users, agent, and power dispatching center.

maybe,,Modeling the charging behaviors for electric vehicles based on ternary symmetric kernel density estimation,"The accurate modeling of the charging behaviors for electric vehicles (EVs) is the basis for the charging load modeling, the charging impact on the power grid, orderly charging strategy, and planning of charging facilities. Therefore, an accurate joint modeling approach of the arrival time, the staying time, and the charging capacity for the EVs charging behaviors in the work area based on ternary symmetric kernel density estimation (KDE) is proposed in accordance with the actual data. First and foremost, a data transformation model is established by considering the boundary bias of the symmetric KDE in order to carry out normal transformation on distribution to be estimated from all kinds of dimensions to the utmost extent. Then, a ternary symmetric KDE model and an optimum bandwidth model are established to estimate the transformed data. Moreover, an estimation evaluation model is also built to transform simulated data that are generated on a certain scale with the Monte Carlo method by means of inverse transformation, so that the fitting level of the ternary symmetric KDE model can be estimated. According to simulation results, a higher fitting level can be achieved by the ternary symmetric KDE method proposed in this paper, in comparison to the joint estimation method based on the edge KDE and the ternary t-Copula function. Moreover, data transformation can effectively eliminate the boundary effect of symmetric KDE. © 2020 by the authors.",10.3390/en13071551,2020,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en13071551,10,high

Consequently, in the near future, their charging demand is expected to grow enough for consideration in the planning process of the transmission system. This study proposes a stochastic method for modeling the PEV charging demand, of which the time and amount are uncertain. In the proposed method, the distribution of PEVs is estimated by the substations based on the number of electricity customers, PEV expansion target, and statistics of existing vehicles. An individual PEV charging profile is modeled using the statistics of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles driving and by aggregating the PEV charging profiles per 154 kV substation, the charging demand of PEVs is determined for consideration as part of the total electricity demand in the planning process of transmission systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through case studies in the Korean power system.

For this purpose, a long-term generation and transmission expansion co-optimization model is used, which captures the hourly operational dynamics of the system by means of the use of representative days. This is relevant since smart charging schemes for Electric Vehicles (EVs) are available, and their benefits are intertwined with the hourly available generation (especially solar), the level of demand, and the transmission capacity. Private and public EVs’ demand is considered through five main scenarios, which differ in the number of EVs and the charging strategies used (i.e., upon-arrival charging or smart charging). The analysis is illustrated using the Chilean power grid. The numerical results show that a massive penetration of EVs in the Chilean power generation system will heavily encourage solar power capacity investments. Furthermore, smart charging allows for an additional increase in the solar power installed, leading (in the Chilean case) to an extra 2.4% increase in solar power generation and an additional 2.5% decrease in fossil fuel-based generation, which was commonly used to offer flexibility to the system. These effects are diminished if a high-enough level of solar power is not feasible.

maybe,,Advanced techno-economic modelling of distribution network investment requirements,"In an increasingly dynamic and changing electricity sector with rising distributed energy resources, new network investment models are needed that enable consideration of flexibility, uncertainty and risk. Existing modelling frameworks include “top down” models that offer a comparisonofinvestmentandinvestmentstrategiesbetween scenarios and “bottom up” models that consider detailed technical impacts on real networks. These frameworks are broadly appropriate for analysing investment, with the requirements of the business, stakeholders and regulator influencing the specific model design and implementation. There are a number of dimensions across network engineering, investment, customers and energy markets to be captured and represented in the modelling at some level. This paper presents a number of advanced modelling techniques which can be applied to both top-down and bottom up modelling frameworks, enabling better consideration of customer variability, network risk and optioneering of solutions. Drawing on Bayesian statistics, customer load has been represented using a sophisticated statistical model that reflects both variability and uncertainty in demand on LV networks. This can help to explicitly quantify network risk due to existing loads, new loads and customer flexibility. A network ‘emulator’model provides significantly faster run-times for analysis of large solution sets by parameterising the variables of a power flow model against the inputs. This has been applied and tested with LV, HV and EHV networks with results closely matching equivalent power flow models. Implemented in combination with the Bayesian customer load model enables probabilistic, risk-based modelling. A constrained cost optimisation algorithm has also been developed to find the lowest cost combination of solutions that can address constraints that have arisen on a network. This is based on a cost function that accounts for factors including disruption costs, cross-network benefits, life expectancy, enabler costs, flexibility, as well as capex and opex. Finally, it is important that these models represent the reality of the actual network planning and investment decision making processes they are representing. This is often very complex, and can be difficult to reflect in a model. Alternatively, decision-making processes may be adapted to incorporate them. © 2020, CIGRE.

It is designed in such a way that the EVs are charged at a fixed price (rather than time-of-use price) without incurring economic losses to the station owner. The simulation is modeled using the single diode model (for PV) and the state of charge of Li-ion battery (for ESU and EV). The objective function of the PSO is formulated based on a financial model that comprises of the grid tariff, EV demand, and the purchasing as well as selling prices of the energy from PV and ESU. By integrating the financial model with energy management algorithm (EMA), the PSO computes the minimum number of PV modules (N<inf>pv</inf>) and ESU batteries (N<inf>bat</inf>) for a various number of vehicles and office holidays. The resiliency of the proposed system is validated under different weather conditions, EV fleet, parity levels, energy prices, and operating period. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed system is compared with the standard grid charging system. The results suggest that with the computed N<inf>pv</inf> and N<inf>bat</inf>, the charging price is decreased by approximately 16%, while the EV charging burden on the grid is reduced by 94% to 99%.

Different energy scenarios are simulated with the help of EnergyPLAN software assuming a progressive increase in renewable energy sources capacity and electric vehicles penetration. Results show that, for the German case, the additional electricity required leads to a reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions only if renewable capacity increases significantly, whereas the Italian energy system benefits from transport electrification even at low renewable capacity. With a sixfold increase in renewables capacity and assuming a complete electrification of private transportation where electric vehicles charging strategy is regulated to enhance renewable integration, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions can be reduced by 22% and 39% for Italy and Germany respectively. However, this comes along with a remarkable renewable surplus, respectively equal to 15% and 28% of the total national production unless large-scale energy storage systems are deployed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113848,2019,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113848,10,high
maybe,,Orchestrating incentive designs to reduce adverse system-level effects of large-scale EV/PV adoption – The case of Portugal,"The adoption of energy transition technologies for residential use is accelerated through incentive designs. The structure of such incentives affects technology adoption patterns, that is, the locations where new technologies are installed and used. These spatial adoption patterns influence network expansion costs and provide indication on potential cross-subsidization between population groups. While until today, most programs have been involuntarily favoring households with high-income and above-average educated population groups, incentive designs are currently under review. This paper presents a spatiotemporal technology adoption model that can predict adoption behavior of residential electric vehicle (EV) chargers and photovoltaic (PV) modules up to a predefined time horizon. A set of EV and PV adoption patterns for nine incentive design combinations are compared in order to assess potential synergies that may arise under orchestrated EV and PV adoption. Effects on adoption asymmetries are evaluated using an Information-Theoretic inequality metric. Results for Continental Portugal show that global network expansion costs can be reduced while minimizing technology adoption asymmetries, if specific incentive designs are combined. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113931,2019,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113931,10,high
maybe,,Modeling and multi-objective optimization of a stand-alone PV-hydrogen-retired EV battery hybrid energy system,"Reusing retired electric vehicle batteries (REVBs) in renewable energy systems is a relatively new concept, and the presented PV-hydrogen-REVB hybrid energy system is a promising way to exploit REVBs’ residual capacities. This paper focuses on the design and sizing optimization of the entire system and delivers three main contributions. First, this paper proposes a REVB model based on the model of capacity fading of lithium battery cells, which could allow a more realistic result for the design. Second, a power management strategy is presented to regulate the energy flow, for protecting the REVB and other system components. Third, multiple objectives are considered in the optimization model, including minimizing loss of power supply, system cost, and a new indicator, namely, potential energy waste. Then, using the simulation results of a five-year working period to calculate the objective functions, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II is applied to generate the Pareto set of a case for residential usage. In further discussions, the influences of ignoring REVB's capacity fading and removing the objective of potential energy waste possibility are presented, as well as the comparison of performances between NSGA-II and MOEA/D. The results reveal that the reliability of the system is impaired if ignoring the REVB's capacity loss, and the proposed indicator is crucial for the design. NSGA-II has a better performance regarding the distribution of solutions and gives better results in this study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.enconman.2018.11.079,2019,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.11.079,10,high
maybe,,A demand response-centred approach to the long-term equipment capacity planning of grid-independent micro-grids optimized by the moth-flame optimization algorithm,"The off-grid electrification of remote communities, by utilizing renewable energy technologies through the development of smart micro-grids, is necessary to realize the sustainable development goals. Optimal sizing of an isolated micro-grid is challenging as it needs to satisfy the electricity demand of the customers from a long-term perspective, whilst adhering to constraints in terms of power supply reliability and system operation without losing computational tractability. This paper proposes a novel method for the optimal sizing process, subject to satisfying a reliability index for meeting the loads. The proposed method also incorporates a direct load control demand response program, and utilizes a data compression-based model reduction technique to flatten the load curve and reduce the computational effort. A conceptual micro-grid model incorporating photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, a battery bank, a DC/AC converter, and an electric vehicle parking lot is used as a test-case system to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimal sizing method. Moreover, a maiden attempt is made to investigate and confirm the effective application of the moth-flame optimization algorithm within the context of the proposed method. Accordingly, the performance of the moth-flame optimization algorithm is compared with the most preferred and up-to-date meta-heuristics employed for solving the optimal equipment capacity planning problems of renewable and sustainable energy systems, and is confirmed as superior in terms of nearing the optimal solutions. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that implementing a demand response program, by scheduling the charging of electric vehicles, together with directly controlling the domestic deferrable loads, can avoid overloading. This improves the utilization of the available components, which, in turn, reduces the size of some of the components and the life-cycle cost of the system. Hengam Island, Iran is used as a representative case study site to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of both the proposed method and the conceptualized micro-grid system. The calculated levelized cost of energy of $0.15/kWh, the discounted payback period of 10.53 years, the profitability index of 2.09%, and the internal rate of return of 11.28%, suggest that the realization of the conceptualized micro-grid on this island is not only technically feasible, but also economically viable.

Both the electric and hydrogen vehicles are charged at the same time. They appear as two electrical and hydrogen load demand on the charging station and the charging station is powered by solar panels. The output power of solar system is separated into two parts. On part of solar power is used to supply the electrical load demand (to charge the electric vehicles) and rest runs water electrolyzer and it will be converted to the hydrogen. The hydrogen is stored and it supplies the hydrogen load demand (to charge the hydrogen-burning vehicles). The uncertainty of parameters (solar energy, consumed power by electrical vehicles, and consumed power by hydrogen vehicles) is included and modeled. The fuel cell is added to the charging station to deal with such uncertainty. The fuel cell runs on hydrogen and produces electrical energy to supply electrical loading under uncertainties. The diesel generator is also added to the charging station as a supplementary generation. The problem is modeled as stochastic optimization programming and minimizes the investment and operational costs of solar and diesel systems. The introduced planning finds optimal rated powers of solar system and diesel generator, operation pattern for diesel generator and fuel cell, and the stored hydrogen. The results confirm that the cost of changing station is covered by investment cost of solar system (95%), operational cost of diesel generator (4.5%), and investment cost of diesel generator (0.5%). The fuel cell and diesel generator supply the load demand when the solar energy is zero. About 97% of solar energy will be converted to hydrogen and stored.

In EU, many islands have become sites of energy innovation, where betting on Renewable Energy Sources is a winning choice to meet their energy needs. In this framework, renewable energies play a key role for supporting the transition of small islands to an autonomous, cleaner and low-carbon energy system – in line with the overall EU Energy Union package and EU2030 goals.

maybe,,Stackelberg based optimal planning of DGs and electric vehicle parking lot by implementing demand response program,"With respect to the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) due to pursuing environmental targets, EV parking lots establishment for giving charge and discharge services is necessary. Nevertheless, distribution companies (DisCos) seek to reduce the planning cost as much as possible and in this regard, demand response can be one of their effective options. However the customers participated in this program reduce or shift their consumption for the sake of increasing their benefit and accordingly DisCo must provide an incentive like the decrease in energy price which causes a competition between the DisCo and customers decisions. Because selling energy with higher price is preferable for DisCo. Hence what is proposed in this paper is the optimal probabilistic and long term planning of DGs and EV parking lots in the presence of demand response in which the mentioned competition is controlled via implementing Stackelberg game theory. In this game, DisCo plays as the leader and the customers interested in demand response play as the followers and their interaction is conducted though a decentralized distributed algorithm which finally determines the consumption profiles and the related energy selling price for all scenarios through the panning period. © 2019",10.1016/j.scs.2019.101743,2019,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2019.101743,10,high
maybe,,An EV Charging Demand Model for the Distribution System Using Traffic Property,"This paper proposes a mathematical model for the spatial-temporal charging demand for electric vehicle (EV). The determination of spatial-temporal charging demand is a key step for the planning of distribution systems with a scalable application of EV. The spatial-temporal allocation of EV is conventionally obtained through a simulation procedure using traffic topology data, which is not suitable for the regions lacking such information. This model converts the problem of travel distance to travel duration so that the requirement of network geographic information can be avoided. Static EV parameters, EV spatial-temporal moving parameters and system charging model parameters are treated as the deterministic factors for the charging demand allocation. A stochastic travel route simulation procedure, which relies purely on statistical data of traffic flow, is also developed to obtain the EV moving parameters by adopting the traffic property information. The designed procedure derives travel time parameters from the vehicle dynamic-location-property (DLP) model and the travel time probability distribution. The DLP model is established using the traffic property matrix and the regional origin-destination matrix. A simple case is presented to illustrate the result of stochastic travel route simulation. Then, a modified eastern China system is used as an example to analyze the EV charging demand under multiple scenarios.

This paper aims to enhance the environmental benefits of EVs by differentiating the marginal impacts of coal-fired unit emissions at various times and locations on ambient air pollutant concentration (AAPC) and human health conditions. The proposed cost-effective approach will assign EV battery charging loads and other electricity demands to generation units with low health impacts. The proposed air pollution dispersion model maps the emission into spatial AAPC increments ( ${\Delta }$ AAPCs), and concentration-response function maps ${\Delta }$ AAPCs into health impacts. As such, we estimate differentiating health impacts of emissions at various times and locations without executing large-scale atmospheric models.

A strategic R & D planning process was developed in this study to accomplish the complicated tasks, which comprises five steps: (i) background research of smart grid industry; (ii) selection of R & D target; (iii) societal, technological, economical, environmental, and political (STEEP) analysis to obtain a macro-level perspective and insight for achieving the selected R & D target; (iv) patent analysis to explore capabilities of the R & D target and to select the entry direction for smart grid industry; and, (v) nine windows and scenario planning analyses to develop a method and process in establishing a future strategic R & D plan. This R & D planning process was further applied to the case of a Korean company holding technological capabilities in the sustainable smart grid domain, as well as in the sustainable electric vehicle charging system, a global consumer market of smart grid. Four plausible scenarios were produced by varying key change agents for the results of this process, such as technology and growth rates, policies and government subsidies, and system standards of the smart grid charging system: Scenario 1, 'The Stabilized Settlement of the Smart Grid Industry'; Scenario 2, 'The Short-lived Blue Ocean of the Smart Grid Industry'; Scenario 3, 'The Questionable Market of the Smart Grid'; and, Scenario 4, 'The Stalemate of the Smart Grid Industry'. The R & D plan suggestions were arranged for each scenario and detailed ways to cope with dissonant situations were also implied for the company. In sum, in this case study, a future strategic R & D plan was suggested in regard to the electric vehicle charging technology business, which includes smart grid communication system, battery charging duration, service infrastructure, public charge station system, platform and module, wireless charging, data management system, and electric system solution. The strategic R & D planning process of this study can be applicable in various technologies and business fields, because of no inherent dependency on particular subject, like electric vehicle charging technology based on smart grid. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/su11102907,2019,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/su11102907,10,high
maybe,,Efficient energy-management system using a hybrid transactive-model predictive control mechanism for prosumer-centric networked microgrids,"With the development of distributed energy resources (DERs) and advancements in technology, microgrids (MGs) appear primed to become an even more integral part of the future distribution grid. In order to transition to the smart grid of the future, MGs must be properly managed and controlled. This paper proposes a microgrid energy management system (MGEMS) based on a hybrid control algorithm that combines Transactive Control (TC) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for an efficient management of DERs in prosumer-centric networked MGs. A locally installed home energy management system (HEMS) determines a charge schedule for the battery electric vehicle (BEV) and a charge-discharge schedule for the solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) to reduce residential customers' operation cost and to improve their overall savings. The proposed networked MGEMS strategy was implemented in IEEE 33-bus test system and evaluated under different BEV and PV-BESS penetration scenarios to study the potential impact that large amounts of BEV and PV-BESS systems can have on the distribution system and how different pricing mechanisms can mitigate these impacts. Test results indicate that our proposed MGEMS strategy shows potential to reduce peak load and power losses as well as to enhance customers' savings. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/su11195436,2019,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/su11195436,10,high
maybe,,Orchestrating incentive designs to reduce adverse system-level effects of large-scale EV/PV adoption – The case of Portugal,"The adoption of energy transition technologies for residential use is accelerated through incentive designs. The structure of such incentives affects technology adoption patterns, that is, the locations where new technologies are installed and used. These spatial adoption patterns influence network expansion costs and provide indication on potential cross-subsidization between population groups. While until today, most programs have been involuntarily favoring households with high-income and above-average educated population groups, incentive designs are currently under review. This paper presents a spatiotemporal technology adoption model that can predict adoption behavior of residential electric vehicle (EV) chargers and photovoltaic (PV) modules up to a predefined time horizon. A set of EV and PV adoption patterns for nine incentive design combinations are compared in order to assess potential synergies that may arise under orchestrated EV and PV adoption. Effects on adoption asymmetries are evaluated using an Information-Theoretic inequality metric. Results for Continental Portugal show that global network expansion costs can be reduced while minimizing technology adoption asymmetries, if specific incentive designs are combined.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113931,2019,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113931,10,high
maybe,,Socio-technical smart grid optimization via decentralized charge control of electric vehicles,"The penetration of electric vehicles becomes a catalyst for the sustainability of Smart Cities. However, unregulated battery charging remains a challenge causing high energy costs, power peaks or even blackouts. This paper studies this challenge from a socio-technical perspective: social dynamics such as the participation in demand-response programs, the discomfort experienced by alternative suggested vehicle usage times and even the fairness in terms of how equally discomfort is experienced among the population are highly intertwined with Smart Grid reliability. To address challenges of such a socio-technical nature, this paper introduces a fully decentralized and participatory learning mechanism for privacy-preserving coordinated charging control of electric vehicles that regulates three Smart Grid socio-technical aspects: (i) reliability, (ii) discomfort and (iii) fairness. In contrast to related work, a novel autonomous software agent exclusively uses local knowledge to generate energy demand plans for its vehicle that encode different battery charging regimes. Agents interact to learn and make collective decisions of which plan to execute so that power peaks and energy cost are reduced system-wide. Evaluation with real-world data confirms the improvement of drivers’ comfort and fairness using the proposed planning method, while this improvement is assessed in terms of reliability and cost reduction under a varying number of participating vehicles. These findings have a significant relevance and impact for power utilities and system operator on designing more reliable and socially responsible Smart Grids with high penetration of electric vehicles.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105573,2019,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105573,10,high
maybe,,Synergy between smart energy systems simulation tools for greening small Mediterranean islands,"Several islands around the world are facing common challenges in terms of high energy costs, local CO2 emissions, security of supply and system stability. In EU, many islands have become sites of energy innovation, where betting on Renewable Energy Sources is a winning choice to meet their energy needs. In this framework, renewable energies play a key role for supporting the transition of small islands to an autonomous, cleaner and low-carbon energy system – in line with the overall EU Energy Union package and EU2030 goals. This study examines the suitability of using hybrid energy system comprising photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, biomass and diesel generators to meet the electricity demand of Favignana Island, to increase the penetration of renewables in the local electricity grid. Additionally, the energy scenarios simulation aimed at identifying foreseeable energy-environmentally improvements associated to the mutual merging of further energy sectors, such as transportation and heating sector. Consequently, the renewable capacity firming issues can be strongly mitigated by integrating new energy demand components. Thus, this work shows in a systemic overview all the outcomes related to the different energy mix layout, with varying the RES share values compatibly with the local grid electrotechnical constraints. Furthermore, this paper studies the impact that the introduction of electric vehicles into the island car fleet will have on the energy system.

maybe,,Modeling Analysis of Electric Vehicle Penetration Scenario using Dynamic Optimal Power Generation Mix Model with High Temporal Resolution,"After the Fukushima nuclear accident, Japanese power generation planning needs to be reassessed to reflect technical developments on both the power supply and demand sides. The Fukushima nuclear accident has complicated the position of nuclear energy in Japan's long-term power generation mix due to public acceptance and other associated issues such as nuclear waste management. There is a need for more studies concerning the peak grid integration of variable renewables such as PV and wind power, which are expected to potentially replace nuclear energy. On the power demand side, the anticipated future introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) will have an impact on grid management in the electric power system. In this context, it is important to develop a computational tool to comprehensively analyze the optimal power generation mix and organize it in a consistent way. This paper develops a dynamic high time-resolution optimal power generation mix model as large-scale linear programming model with 18 million constraints and 8 million endogenous variables. It then analyzes the optimal deployment of variable renewables (VR) and EVs with the future possible nuclear scenario and CO<inf>2</inf> regulation policy in Japan taken into consideration. In the calculated optimal solutions, EVs play an important role in integrating variable renewables and treating the imbalance in VR surplus output. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/eej.22942,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1002/eej.22942,10,high
maybe,,Parking lot allocation with maximum economic benefit in a distribution network,"Optimal placement of parking lots with optimal scheduling in power systems to maximize the benefit, considering different peak load states and different electricity prices for each state, is studied in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is tested on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system with considering the power system constraints and using genetic algorithm. This algorithm selects the optimal sites and sizes (number of electric vehicles) of these parking lots and shows the optimal results. The results of these simulations with genetic algorithm demonstrate that the economic problem of parking lots placement depends on many items such as number of the electrical vehicles (EVs) in each parking lot (capacity of parking lot), state of charge of EVs, as well as the electricity price in peak/off-peak periods. Moreover, it is suggested that the existence of parking lots, considering adequate incentives for EVs owners, has economic benefit for distribution network operators, reduces total power loss, and can improve the distribution system voltage profile. Also, the number of parking lots to be allocated in a distribution system supports the distribution system at peak load hours because it is more interesting from economic point of view to install more parking lots.

maybe,,A robust flexible-probabilistic programming method for planning municipal energy system with considering peak-electricity price and electric vehicle,"Effective electric power systems (EPS) planning with considering electricity price of 24-h time is indispensable in terms of load shifting, pollutant mitigation and energy demand-supply reliability as well as reducing electricity expense of end-users. In this study, a robust flexible probabilistic programming (RFPP) method is developed for planning municipal energy system (MES) with considering peak electricity prices (PEPs) and electric vehicles (EVs), where multiple uncertainties regarded as intervals, probability distributions and flexibilities as well as their combinations can be effectively reflected. The RFPP-MES model is then applied to planning Qingdao's MES, where electrical load of 24-h time is simulated based on Monte Carlo. Results reveal that: (a) different time intervals lead to changes of energy supply patterns, the energy supply patterns would tend to the transition from self-supporting dominated (i.e. in valley hours) to outsourcing-dominated (i.e. in peak hours); (b) 15.9% of total imported electricity expense would be reduced compared to that without considering PEPs; (c) with considering EVs, the CO<inf>2</inf>emissions of Qingdao's transportation could be reduced directly and the reduction rate would be 2.5%. Results can help decision makers improve energy supply patterns, reduce energy system costs and abate pollutant emissions as well as adjust end-users’ consumptions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.028,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.028,10,high
maybe,,Optimal distribution transformer sizing in a harmonic involved load environment via dynamic programming technique,"Installation of a significant number of distributed generators (DGs), besides the application of non-sinusoidal loads such as; Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), in the emerging smart distribution networks and the industrial plants have posed a major challenge to the existing methods of optimal transformer sizing (OTS). The harmonic currents generated in these new environments not only substantially increase the transformer load losses, but also cause abnormal winding temperature rise and hence transformer excessive loss of life. Therefore, the harmonic contents of the loads currents should be accounted in choosing the appropriate size of distribution transformers. To address this concern of utilities, this paper introduces a new method to solve the OTS problem in such environments. It takes into account the effects of harmonics currents on excessive heat generation in a transformer and the transformer insulation loss of life due to these thermal stresses. This paper proposes a new dynamic programming (DP) framework to solve the OTS problem. Although the proposed DP method considers the transformer thermal equations, however, by introducing a novel variable named the depreciation cost, the consecutive stages of the proposed DP network are hold independent. Therefore, the proposed DP method does not require any supplementary heuristic algorithm to solve the OTS problem. In response, the proposed method is very fast and easy to implement. Comprehensive studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2016.12.113,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2016.12.113,10,high
maybe,,An optimal versatile control approach for plug-in electric vehicles to integrate renewable energy sources and smart grids,"This study proposes a practical solution to deal with challenges of integrating renewable energy sources and electric vehicles into the electric grid, considering generation source intermittency and energy usage inconsistency, via a new adaptive intelligent controller. The present research describes a smart grid consisting of power plants and distributed generation, fueled via photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, and augmented with electric vehicles as power storage devices. Employing a parking lot to deal with challenges such as low penetration of the electric vehicles embedded with Vehicle-to-Grid functionalities encounters two difficulties: where they should be installed, and modeling of bi-directional power flow between electric vehicles, the grid, and the distributed generation system. In this regard, a nonlinear multi-objective problem is designed and solved via employing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, and the forward and backward substitution method. In addition, Newton-Raphson Power Flow is adopted and modified to calculate the power flow of the distribution network. The results related to optimal placement and sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems show that bus 16 of the studied grid is the best place to integrate a parking lot – equipped with 117 photovoltaic and 10 wind turbine units - to the tested IEEE-26 buses. Furthermore, this study suggests that the aforementioned grid could employ a complex versatile control unit able to optimize the operating point, scheduling charging and discharging for a large number of electric vehicles while considering the technical aspects (total active power loss and voltage deviation). In this regard, a new hybrid control approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System tuned via utilizing the optimal power flow problem is proposed. The controller's superiority to handle grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid services is discussed and compared to other studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.007,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.007,10,high
maybe,,"A scenario based approach to designing electricity grids with high variable renewable energy penetrations in Ontario, Canada: Development and application of the SILVER model","A new scenario-based electricity system model, SILVER, explores the trade-offs among alternative balancing strategies for high variable renewable energy (VRE) electricity grids. SILVER optimizes the asset dispatch for a user-defined electricity system configuration that specifies demand response availability, generation assets, storage assets, and transmission infrastructure. SILVER has been applied to twelve Ontario-based scenarios to explore the implications of high VRE penetrations in a 100% renewable scenario. The role that storage, demand response, electric vehicles, and transmission expansion might play in balancing VRE is analyzed. The results highlight the operational differences between balancing options: demand response, with a fixed price remuneration, is dispatched in proportion to net load curve variability, whereas storage technologies which take advantage of price arbitrage, are dispatched in proportion to marginal cost variability. GHG emissions fall with increasing VRE penetrations; however, there are local maxima when natural gas replaces nuclear generation, which interrupt this trend. Weak wind resources in the summer necessitate significant non-VRE capacity, which increases capital costs for higher VRE penetrations. Ontario planners have a number of interdependent challenges to contend with: integrating VREs on a nuclear-dominated system, mitigating wind's significant seasonal variability, and establishing effective remuneration mechanisms to improve grid flexibility. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.027,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.027,10,high
maybe,,Analysis of reflectivity & predictability of electricity network tariff structures for household consumers,"Distribution network operators charge household consumers with a network tariff, so they can recover their network investment and operational costs. With the transition; towards a sustainable energy system, the household load is changing, through the introduction of photovoltaics and electric vehicles. The tariff structures which are currently employed in the EU are either capacity and/or energy consumption based. In light of the changes in the household load the question whether these tariff structures are the most suitable merits renewed attention. In this work, the cost-reflectivity of various tariff structures has been computed based on a distribution network planning approach. Next to this, the predictability of a network tariff, i.e. how much change would a household experience in network charges in two consecutive years has also been computed to gain insight into how well users will be able to react to the tariff. The results show that a peak load based network tariffs score best on the reflectivity while having an acceptable level of predictability. The switch from an energy consumption based network tariff, which is now most often applied, towards a peak load based network tariff should therefore, be considered. © 2017 The Authors",10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.049,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.049,10,high
maybe,,Valuation of measurement data for low voltage network expansion planning,"The introduction of electric vehicles and photovoltaics is changing the residential electricity consumption. Distribution network operators (DNO) are investing in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to enable cost reduction through smart grid applications. The DNO also benefits from the additional measurement data the AMI gives for the network planning process. The availability of AMI data can be limited by the cost of communication and by privacy concerns. To determine the social welfare of an AMI, the economic gains should be estimated. For the planning of the low voltage (LV) network, a method for determining the value of an AMI still needs to be developed. Therefore, a planning methodology which allows various levels of measurement data availability has been developed. By applying this approach the value of different levels of AMI from an LV-network planning perspective can be determined. To illustrated the application of this approach a case study for the LV-network of a Dutch DNO is performed. The results show that an increase in measurement data can lead to €49-254 lower LV-network reinforcement costs. A detailed analysis of the results shows that already 50% of the possible cost reduction can be achieved if only 65% of the households have AMI data available. © 2017 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.epsr.2017.05.017,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2017.05.017,10,high
maybe,,A simultaneous approach for optimal allocation of renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging stations in smart grids based on improved GA-PSO algorithm,"Due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EV) load demand, large scale penetration of these resources in the power systems can stress the reliable network performance, such as reducing power quality, increasing power losses, and voltage deviations. These challenges must be minimized by optimal planning based on the variable output from RES to meet the additional demand caused by EV charging. In this paper, a novel method for optimal allocation and sizing of RES and EV charging stations simultaneously and managing vehicle charging process is provided. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to obtain objective variables in order to reduce power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and demand supplying costs, and EV battery cost. In this optimization problem, the location and capacity of RES and EV charging stations are the optimization variables. Coefficients which are dependent on wind speed, solar radiation, and hourly peak demand ratio for the management of the EV charging pattern in off-peak load hours are introduced. Genetic Algorithm-Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO) hybrid improved optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem in five different scenarios. The performance of the proposed method on IEEE 33-bus system has been investigated to validate the effectiveness of the novel GA-PSO method to optimal sitting and sizing of RES and EV charging stations simultaneously. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.scs.2017.05.007,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2017.05.007,10,high

Modelling of PEVs (as vehicle to grid (V2G)) is highly dependent on the owner's behaviour. In this study, a systematic method based on multi-state Markov model is utilised to represent the uncertainty of V2G's presence. To investigate the impact of PEVs, a probabilistic TEP in the presence of V2Gs (P_TEPV2G) is proposed. In the proposed TEP model, the objective function consists of the total line and risk costs (RCs). Moreover, the optimal place and capacity of PEV parking lots are considered as the decision variables. It is assumed that there is an electric vehicle fleet operator for the management of electric vehicles. Because P_TEPV2G is a complex and non-linear optimisation problem, an improved cuckoo search algorithm (ICS) is utilised to effectively solve the problem.

maybe,,Analysis of operating reserve demand curves in power system operations in the presence of variable generation,"The electric power industry landscape is continually evolving. As emerging technologies such as wind and solar generating systems become more cost effective, traditional power system operating strategies will need to be re-evaluated. The presence of wind and solar generation (commonly referred to as variable generation or VG) can increase variability and uncertainty in the net-load profile. One mechanism to mitigate this issue is to schedule and dispatch additional operating reserves. These operating reserves aim to ensure that there is enough capacity online in the system to account for the increased variability and uncertainty occurring at finer temporal resolutions. A new operating reserve strategy, referred to as flexibility reserve, has been introduced in some regions. A similar implementation is explored in this study, and its implications on power system operations are analysed. Results show that flexibility reserve products can improve economic metrics, particularly in significantly reducing the number of scarcity pricing events, with minimal impacts on reliability metrics and production costs. The production costs increased due to increased VG curtailment - i.e. including the flexible ramping product in the commitment of excess thermal capacity that needed to remain online at the expense of VG output.",10.1049/iet-rpg.2016.0225,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1049/iet-rpg.2016.0225,10,high

maybe,,Battery Status Sensing Software-Defined Multicast for V2G Regulation in Smart Grid,"During the bidirectional exchange of electricity between electric vehicles (EVs) and smart grid, plenty of sensors have been deployed to sense the EVs' battery status and monitor the electricity regulation requirements. When electricity consumption at power grid demand-side sharply increases/decreases, charging points (CPs) access these sensors by multicast technology to aggregate the EVs' battery status, publish electricity regulation requests and assign the state of charge (SOC) transition instructs in vehicle-to-grid (V2G). However, intermittent connections arising from distributed and mobile energy storage bring many challenging problems on multicast scheduling. First, in smart grid, peak shaving and load shifting require V2G to sense and regulate the EVs' SOC according to their battery status precisely, while the traditional multicast only considers their mutable network locations (e.g., WLAN, IP, and MAC). Second, as the number of EVs that participate into V2G increases, V2G needs to schedule the massive multicast traffic with priority to satisfy the dynamic and real-time regulation requirements. To address these problems, in this paper, we first aim to demonstrate that the appreciable battery status is more adaptive than network location to act as a multicast primitive in V2G. We propose a battery status sensing software-defined multicast (BSS-SDM) scheme to reduce the latency of V2G regulation services. In the BSS-SDM scheme, the battery status of each EV is identified during SOC transitions and maintained by a centralized controller. Besides, we propose a battery-status-based multicast scheduling algorithm to implement the V2G regulation optimization.

We assume that each EV owner solves a decision problem to pick a cost-minimizing charge and travel plan. This individual decision takes into account traffic congestion in the transportation network, affecting travel times, as well as congestion in the power grid, resulting in spatial variations in electricity prices for battery charging. We show that this decision problem is equivalent to finding the shortest path on an “extended” transportation graph, with virtual arcs that represent charging options. Using this extended graph, we study the collective effects of a large number of EV owners individually solving this path planning problem. We propose a scheme in which independent power and transportation system operators can collaborate to manage each network towards a socially optimum operating point while keeping the operational data of each system private.

The condition requires that the allowed reverse power flow is only reactive or active, or none. Under the proposed sufficient condition, the feasible sub-injection region (power injections of nodes excluding the root node) of the ac OPF is convex. The exactness of the convex relaxation under the proposed condition is proved through constructing a group of monotonic series with limits, which ensures that the optimal solution of the SOCP can be converted to an optimal solution of the original ac OPF. The efficacy of the convex relaxation to solve the ac OPF is demonstrated by case studies of an optimal multi-period planning problem of electric vehicles in distribution networks.",10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2574805,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpwrs.2016.2574805,10,high
maybe,,Scalable Electric Vehicle Charging Protocols,"Although electric vehicles are considered a viable solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, their uncoordinated charging could have adverse effects on power system operation. Nevertheless, the task of optimal electric vehicle charging scales unfavorably with the fleet size and the number of control periods, especially when distribution grid limitations are enforced. To this end, vehicle charging is first tackled using the recently revived Frank-Wolfe method. The novel decentralized charging protocol has minimal computational requirements from vehicle controllers, enjoys provable acceleration over existing alternatives, enhances the security of the pricing mechanism against data attacks, and protects user privacy. To comply with voltage limits, a network-constrained EV charging problem is subsequently formulated. Leveraging a linearized model for unbalanced distribution grids, the goal is to minimize the power supply cost while respecting critical voltage regulation and substation capacity limitations. Optimizing variables across grid nodes is accomplished by exchanging information only between neighboring buses via the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical tests corroborate the optimality and efficiency of the novel schemes.",10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2582903,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpwrs.2016.2582903,10,high
maybe,,A Modular Power System Planning and Power Flow Simulation Framework for Generating and Evaluating Power Network Models,"This work presents a modular power system planning and power flow simulation framework for the generation and evaluation of power network models (PNM) using spatially resolved demand data. It targets users who want to study large-scale power grids having only limited information on the actual power system. Besides creating cost minimal PNMs, users are able to flexibly configure the framework to produce PNMs individually tailored to their specific use cases. Both greenfield and expansion planning are possible. The framework further comprises a built-in ac power flow simulation designed to simulate power flows in large-scale networks. This allows users to conduct a great variety of simulation studies on entire power systems, which would otherwise not be possible without access to comprehensive power grid data. Apart from the presentation of the methodology, this work comprises a demonstration of the power system planning process at the example of Singapore.

In this paper, a partial decomposition method which is based on the Lagrangian relaxation framework is proposed for the EV charging control in transmission-constrained power systems. The partial decomposition method helps reduce the number of dual multipliers and stabilize the iterative process. The proposed partial decomposition framework is applied to a day-ahead SCUC algorithm which can be easily implemented in the existing hierarchical power system operations.

maybe,,Vehicular Energy Network,"The smart grid spawns many innovative ideas, but many of them cannot be easily integrated into the existing power system due to power system constraints, such as the lack of capacity to transport renewable energy in remote areas to the urban centers. An energy delivery system can be built upon the traffic network and electric vehicles (EVs) utilized as energy carriers to transport energy over a large geographical region. A generalized architecture called the vehicular energy network (VEN) is constructed and a mathematically tractable framework is developed. Dynamic wireless (dis)charging allows electric energy, as an energy packet, to be added and subtracted from EV batteries seamlessly. With proper routing, energy can be transported from the sources to destinations through EVs along appropriate vehicular routes. This paper gives a preliminary study of VEN. Models are developed to study its operational and economic feasibilities with real traffic data in U. K. This paper shows that a substantial amount of renewable energy can be transported from some remote wind farms to London under some reasonable settings and VEN is likely to be profitable in the near future.

maybe,,Optimal Capacity Sizing for Completely Green Charging Systems for Electric Vehicles,"Although proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) is associated with significant environmental benefits, these benefits would be forfeited if the associated EV charging systems would rely only on conventional power grid, whose power is mainly generated by fossil-fueled power plants. In contrast, utilizing distributed renewable energy sources (RES) will preserve and further amplify these environmental benefits. However, planning of green EV charging systems has not been adequately investigated in the technical literature. This paper studies the optimal sizing of a completely green charging system, which relies entirely on the power generated by RES, specifically by solar panels. In particular, this paper presents a methodology to determine the optimal resource size (e.g., the number of solar panels and the energy-storage capacity) that minimizes the charging system's investment costs, while meeting the charging system's performance metrics. A search-based algorithm is devised to solve the formulated nonlinear integer programming problem in order to efficiently explore the problem's solution space. A 3-D Markov chain model is used to account for the intermittency in solar power production. Finally, an example of a completely green charging system is presented to demonstrate the use of the proposed methodology. © 2015 IEEE.",10.1109/TTE.2017.2713098,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tte.2017.2713098,10,high

But a large-scale vehicle-to-grid system may cause adverse effects in the distribution network operation, the power network planning and such other parts. First, this paper collects the factors that influence the electric vehicle charging load and establishes the EV charging load model with a Monte- Carlo method. Then, we analyze the effect that the EV charging load made on the nodal voltage deviation under different permeability based on the IEEE30 node system.

maybe,,Optimal planning of charging for plug-in electric vehicles focusing on users' benefits,"Many electric vehicles' (EVs) charging strategies were proposed to optimize the operations of the power grid, while few focus on users' benefits from the viewpoint of EV users. However, low participation is always a problem of those strategies since EV users also need a charging strategy to serve their needs and interests. This paper proposes a method focusing on EV users' benefits that reduce the cost of battery capacity degradation, electricity cost, and waiting time for different situations. A cost model of battery capacity degradation under different state of charge (SOC) ranges is developed based on experimental data to estimate the cost of battery degradation. The simulation results show that the appropriate planning of the SOC range reduces 80% of the cost of battery degradation, and the queuing theory also reduces over 60% of the waiting time in the busy situations. Those works can also become a premise of charging management to increase the participation. The proposed strategy focusing on EV users' benefits would not give negative impacts on the power grid, and the grid load is also optimized by an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) in the solution space of the charging time restricted by EV users' benefits. © 2017 by the authors.",10.3390/en10070952,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en10070952,10,high
maybe,,Hosting capacity of the power grid for renewable electricity production and new large consumption equipment,"After a brief historical introduction to the hosting-capacity approach, the hosting capacity is presented in this paper as a tool for distribution-system planning under uncertainty. This tool is illustrated by evaluating the readiness of two low-voltage networks for increasing amounts of customers with PV panels or with EV chargers. Both undervoltage and overvoltage are considered in the studies presented here. Probability distribution functions are calculated for the worst-case overvoltage and undervoltage as a function of the number of customers with PV or EV chargers. These distributions are used to obtain 90th percentile values that act as a performance index. This index is compared with an overvoltage or undervoltage limit to get the hosting capacity. General aspects of the hosting-capacity calculations (performance indices, limits, and calculation methods) are discussed for a number of other phenomena: overcurrent; fast voltage magnitude variations; voltage unbalance; harmonics and supraharmonics. The need for gathering data and further development of models for existing demand is emphasised in the discussion and conclusions. © 2017 by the authors.

maybe,,Economic microgrid planning algorithm with electric vehicle charging demands,"Two of the most important technologies for future power systems to reduce greenhouse gas are electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable generation. When EVs become more common, the overall demand of electricity will significantly increase because EVs consume a large amount of electricity. Also, a daily load curve with EVs heavily depends on how much electricity EVs consume and when electricity is consumed. The microgrid is an important technology to promote renewable generation, and the increased demand and changed load curve should be considered in the microgrid planning stage to install robust and economical microgrids. In this paper, we propose an algorithmformicrogrid planning with EV charging demand to find the most economical configuration through which to maximally utilize renewable generation. The algorithm uses a renewable generation-following EV charging scheme and HOMER. Through simulations, it is shown that the microgrid constructed by the proposed algorithm reduces the investment cost and CO<inf>2</inf> emission. © 2017 by the authors.

In this study, a robust flexible probabilistic programming (RFPP) method is developed for planning municipal energy system (MES) with considering peak electricity prices (PEPs) and electric vehicles (EVs), where multiple uncertainties regarded as intervals, probability distributions and flexibilities as well as their combinations can be effectively reflected. The RFPP-MES model is then applied to planning Qingdao’s MES, where electrical load of 24-h time is simulated based on Monte Carlo. Results reveal that: (a) different time intervals lead to changes of energy supply patterns, the energy supply patterns would tend to the transition from self-supporting dominated (i.e. in valley hours) to outsourcing-dominated (i.e. in peak hours); (b) 15.9% of total imported electricity expense would be reduced compared to that without considering PEPs; (c) with considering EVs, the CO2 emissions of Qingdao’s transportation could be reduced directly and the reduction rate would be 2.5%.

maybe,,An optimal versatile control approach for plug-in electric vehicles to integrate renewable energy sources and smart grids,"This study proposes a practical solution to deal with challenges of integrating renewable energy sources and electric vehicles into the electric grid, considering generation source intermittency and energy usage inconsistency, via a new adaptive intelligent controller. The present research describes a smart grid consisting of power plants and distributed generation, fueled via photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, and augmented with electric vehicles as power storage devices. Employing a parking lot to deal with challenges such as low penetration of the electric vehicles embedded with Vehicle-to-Grid functionalities encounters two difficulties: where they should be installed, and modeling of bi-directional power flow between electric vehicles, the grid, and the distributed generation system. In this regard, a nonlinear multi-objective problem is designed and solved via employing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, and the forward and backward substitution method. In addition, Newton-Raphson Power Flow is adopted and modified to calculate the power flow of the distribution network. The results related to optimal placement and sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems show that bus 16 of the studied grid is the best place to integrate a parking lot – equipped with 117 photovoltaic and 10 wind turbine units - to the tested IEEE-26 buses. Furthermore, this study suggests that the aforementioned grid could employ a complex versatile control unit able to optimize the operating point, scheduling charging and discharging for a large number of electric vehicles while considering the technical aspects (total active power loss and voltage deviation). In this regard, a new hybrid control approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System tuned via utilizing the optimal power flow problem is proposed.

maybe,,Valuation of measurement data for low voltage network expansion planning,"The introduction of electric vehicles and photovoltaics is changing the residential electricity consumption. Distribution network operators (DNO) are investing in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to enable cost reduction through smart grid applications. The DNO also benefits from the additional measurement data the AMI gives for the network planning process. The availability of AMI data can be limited by the cost of communication and by privacy concerns. To determine the social welfare of an AMI, the economic gains should be estimated. For the planning of the low voltage (LV) network, a method for determining the value of an AMI still needs to be developed. Therefore, a planning methodology which allows various levels of measurement data availability has been developed. By applying this approach the value of different levels of AMI from an LV-network planning perspective can be determined. To illustrated the application of this approach a case study for the LV-network of a Dutch DNO is performed. The results show that an increase in measurement data can lead to €49-254 lower LV-network reinforcement costs. A detailed analysis of the results shows that already 50% of the possible cost reduction can be achieved if only 65% of the households have AMI data available.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2017.05.017,2017,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2017.05.017,10,high
maybe,,A double-layer smart charging strategy of electric vehicles taking routing and charge scheduling into account,"This paper presents a double-layer smart charging management algorithm (SCMA) for electric vehicles in working place parking lots considering smart grid concept. This model enables safe and controlled charging, which satisfies both power grid and drivers' needs comprehensively. First level of SCMA controls each transformer power demand, transformer capacity, charging station status and the shortest way to reach suitable charger. Second level of SCMA is used during the charging process in order to provide cost-effective and reliable charging as well as less impact on power grid. The proposed SCMA strategy successfully routes the electric vehicles (EVs) to the most suitable charging point, decreases the charging costs and prevents the overloading of transformers.

maybe,,A bi-layer optimization based temporal and spatial scheduling for large-scale electric vehicles,"Electric vehicle (EV) is a promising, environmental friendly technique for its potential to reduce the using of fossil fuels. Massive EVs pose both opportunities and challenges for power systems, especially with the growing amount of wind-power integration. This paper investigates the problem of collaborative optimization scheduling of generators, EVs and wind power. A novel bi-layer optimization of transmission and distribution system is proposed to solve the scheduling problem of EVs charging and discharging load from respective time and space domain in the presence of wind-power. The upper layer optimization in transmission grid coordinates EVs with thermal generators, base load, with the consideration of wind power, to optimize load periods of EVs in the time domain. The lower layer optimization in distribution grid then spatially schedules the location of EVs load. Based on a power system benchmark with a 10-unit transmission grid and an IEEE 33-bus distribution grid, the performance of the proposed bi-layer optimization strategy is evaluated. The impacts of electricity price profile, EVs penetration and EVs load location are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed bi-layer optimization strategy can accommodate wind power and improve both the economics of grid operation and benefits of EV users by scheduling EVs charging and discharging temporally and spatially. Also, the results have shown that the location of EVs charging and discharging load is critical for the distribution network planning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.089,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.089,10,high
maybe,,An optimization framework for the integrated planning of generation and transmission expansion in interconnected power systems,"Energy, and particularly electricity, has played and will continue to play a very important role in the development of human society. Electricity, which is the most flexible and manageable energy form, is currently used in a variety of activities and applications. For instance, electricity is used for heating, cooling, lighting, and for operating electronic appliances and electric vehicles. Nowadays, given the rapid development and commercialization of technologies and devices that rely on electricity, electricity demand is increasing faster than overall primary energy supply. Consequently, the design and planning of power systems is becoming a progressively more important issue in order to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in timely fashion, not only in developed countries but particularly in developing economies where electricity demand is increasing even faster.Power systems are networks of electrical devices, such as power plants, transformers, and transmission lines, used to produce, transmit, and supply electricity. The design and planning of such systems require the selection of generation technologies, along with the capacity, location, and timing of generation and transmission capacity expansions to meet electricity demand over a long-term horizon. This manuscript presents a comprehensive optimization framework for the design and planning of interconnected power systems, including the integration of generation and transmission capacity expansion planning. The proposed framework also considers renewable energies, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, demand-side management (DSM), as well as reserve and CO<inf>2</inf> emission constraints. The novelty of this framework relies on an integrated assessment of the aforementioned features, which can reveal possible interactions and synergies within the power system. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a suite of case studies inspired by a real-world power system, including ""business as usual"" and ""CO<inf>2</inf> mitigation policy"" scenarios.

maybe,,Economic planning of electric vehicle charging stations considering traffic constraints and load profile templates,"This paper develops a novel solution to integrate electric vehicles and optimally determine the siting and sizing of charging stations (CSs), considering the interactions between power and transportation industries. Firstly, the origin–destination (OD) traffic flow data is optimally assigned to the transportation network, which is then utilized to determine the capacity of charging stations. Secondly, the charging demand of charging infrastructures is integrated into a cost-based model to evaluate the economics of candidate plans. Furthermore, load capability constraints are proposed to evaluate whether the candidate CSs deployment and tie line plans could be adopted. Different scenarios generated by load profile templates are innovatively integrated into the economic planning model to deal with uncertain operational states. The models and framework are demonstrated and verified by a test case, which offers a perspective for effectively realizing optimal planning of the CSs considering the constraints from both transportation and distribution networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.021,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.021,10,high
maybe,,Demand flexibility versus physical network expansions in distribution grids,"The volumes of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) are increasing in grids across Europe. Undoubtedly, the distribution networks cope with congestion issues much more often due to distributed generation and increased network use. Such issues are often handled by unit re-dispatching in short term and grid expansion in long term. Re-dispatching is, however, not always an appropriate solution for local distribution networks since the limited generation units are mostly RES of uncontrollable volatility. Recovering the incurred investment costs on the other hand would trigger an increase of the network tariffs. A possible solution is to defer such an investment by utilizing the demand side resources. The FlexMart model, developed and suggested in this paper, provides the ability for the Distribution System Operator (DSO) to purchase demand flexibility offered by residential consumers. Two feeders with different topologies are tested and the ability of the suggested mechanism to provide benefits for the involved stakeholders, both the DSO and the consumers, is demonstrated. The developed empirical model, works as a long-term planning tool and has the ability to provide an optimal combination of physical expansions and flexibility dispatch to reassure the stable and secure operation of the grid. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.145,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.145,10,high
maybe,,Determining the size of PHEV charging stations powered by commercial grid-integrated PV systems considering reactive power support,"Due to low electricity rates at nighttime, home charging for electric vehicles (EVs) is conventionally favored. However, the recent tendency in support of daytime workplace charging that absorbs energy produced by solar photovoltaic (PV) panels appears to be the most promising solution to facilitating higher PV and EV penetration in the power grid. This paper studies optimal sizing of workplace charging stations considering probabilistic reactive power support for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which are powered by PV units in medium voltage (MV) commercial networks. In this study, analytical expressions are first presented to estimate the size of charging stations integrated with PV units with an objective of minimizing energy losses. These stations are capable of providing reactive power support to the main grid in addition to charging PHEVs while considering the probability of PV generation. The study is further extended to investigate the impact of time-varying voltage-dependent charging load models on PV penetration. The simulation results obtained on an 18-bus test distribution system show that various charging load models can produce dissimilar levels of PHEV and PV penetration. Particularly, the maximum energy loss and peak load reductions are achieved at 70.17% and 42.95% respectively for the mixed charging load model, where the system accommodates respective PHEV and PV penetration levels of 9.51% and 50%.

maybe,,Two-layer optimization methodology for wind distributed generation planning considering plug-in electric vehicles uncertainty: A flexible active-reactive power approach,"With increasing the penetration of wind power, the voltage regulation becomes a more important problem in active distribution networks. In addition, as an uncertain load Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) will introduce a new concern in voltage adjustment of future distribution networks. Hence, this paper presents a flexible active-reactive power based Wind Distributed Generation (WDG) planning procedure to address the mentioned challenges. The uncertainties related to WDGs, load demand as well as PEVs load have been handled using the Point Estimate Method (PEM). The distribution network under study is equipped to on-load tap-changer and, as a conventional voltage control component, the Capacitor Banks (CBs) will be planned simultaneously with WDGs. The planning procedure has been considered as a two-loop optimization problem that is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu Search (TS) algorithms. The tap position and power factor of WDGs are taken into account as stochastic variables with practical limitations. The proposed methodology is applied to a typical distribution network and several scenarios are considered and analyzed. Simulation results show that the standard deviation of power factor depends on PEVs penetration that highlights the capability curve of WDGs. The optimal penetration of wind power increases nonlinearly versus increasing of PEVs connected to the distribution network, however the fixed CBs are required to increase the optimal penetration of WDGs. The proposed Modified PSO (MPSO) is compared with the conventional PSO in numerical studies that show MPSO is more efficient than the conventional algorithm for this analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.025,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.025,10,high
maybe,,Flexibility mechanisms and pathways to a highly renewable US electricity future,"This study explores various scenarios and flexibility mechanisms to integrate high penetrations of renewable energy into the US (United States) power grid. A linear programming model - POWER (Power system Optimization With diverse Energy Resources) - is constructed and used to (1) quantify flexibility cost-benefits of geographic aggregation, renewable overgeneration, storage, and flexible electric vehicle charging, and (2) compare pathways to a fully renewable electricity system. Geographic aggregation provides the largest flexibility benefit with ~5-50% cost savings, but each region's contribution to the aggregate RPS (renewable portfolio standard) target is disproportionate, suggesting the need for regional-and-resource-specific RPS targets. Electric vehicle charging yields a lower levelized system cost, revealing the benefits of demand-side flexibility. However, existing demand response price structures may need adjustment to encourage optimal flexible load in highly renewable systems. Two scenarios with RPS targets from 20% to 100% for the US (peak load ~729 GW) and California (peak load ~62 GW) find each RPS target feasible from a planning perspective, but with 2× the cost and 3× the overgeneration at a 100% versus 80% RPS target. Emission reduction cost savings for the aggregated US system with an 80% versus 20% RPS target are roughly $200 billion/year, outweighing the $80 billion/year cost for the same RPS range. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.energy.2016.01.079,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2016.01.079,10,high

Electric vehicles will play an important role in the future energy systems and can reduce the greenhouse gas emission from the transport sector. However, the electric vehicles will increase the electricity consumption and might induce congestions in the transmission systems. In order to deal with the electricity consumption increase from the electric vehicle integration into the power system and maximize the social welfare, the optimal investments of the Nordic transmission system are studied. Case studies were conducted using the market simulation model EMPS (Efi's multi-area power market simulator) and two electric vehicle charging scenarios: a spot price based scenario and a dumb charging scenario. The electric vehicle charging power is assumed to be 3.68 kW with 1 phase 16 A. The complete electrification of the private passenger fleet increases the yearly power demand in the Nordic region with ca 7.5%. The profitable increases in transmission capacities are highest for dumb charging, but are very low for both dumb and spot price based charging compared to a Reference case. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.060,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.060,10,high

A critical challenge with renewable energies is natural intermittency and as such can be addressed appropriately using Energy Storage Systems (ESS). In this paper, optimal planning of battery based energy storage units is proposed in distribution network. As an important challenge in optimal storage planning, the uncertainty investigation is dealt with in this work. A new approach which is based on Point Estimate Method (PEM) is introduced as a tool to handle the uncertainty of the load, the Wind-based Distributed Generation (WDG) and PEVs demand, simultaneously. The proposed method is intuitively compared with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) as well as conventional PEM for a case study and the results are verified through the comparisons. Moreover, in order to challenge voltage control benefit of the storage units, the under study distribution network is equipped to the tap-changer and the capacitor banks. Whereas the optimal storage planning is a very complicated task, a modified hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is used to solve the related optimization problem.

maybe,,Optimal vehicle to grid planning and scheduling using double layer multi-objective algorithm,"Vehicle to grid is a revolutionary technology that allows energy exchange between electric vehicles and power grid for mutual advantages. The implementation of appropriate vehicle to grid energy management system can maximize the potential of electric vehicles to provide grid ancillary services. This paper proposes an optimal vehicle to grid planning and scheduling by utilizing a novel double layer multi-objective algorithm. This optimization algorithm utilizes the grid-connected electric vehicles to perform peak load shaving and load levelling services to minimize the power grid load variance in the first layer optimization. Meanwhile, the second layer optimization minimizes the reactive power compensation for grid voltage regulation and therefore, optimizes the vehicle to grid charger's capacitor sizing. The second layer optimization algorithm utilizes an approximated formula from the simulation of a vehicle to grid charger. The proposed vehicle to grid optimization algorithm considers various power grid and electric vehicle constraints for practicality purpose. With the real time implementation of the proposed algorithm, the optimization results show that the power load curve is effectively followed the preset constant target loading, while the grid voltage is successfully regulated to the predetermined voltage level with minimal amount of reactive power supply from the optimal charger's capacitor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.008,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.008,10,high

It is defined as “the changes in electricity usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns” in response to pricing and incentive payments. This paper focuses on new opportunities for DR with electric vehicles (EVs). EVs are potential distributed energy resources that support both the grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid modes. Their participation in the time-based (e.g., time-of-use) and incentive-based (e.g., regulation services) DR programs helps improve the stability and reduce the potential risks to the grid. Smart scheduling of EV charging and discharging activities also supports high penetration of renewables with volatile energy generation. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model from the Independent System Operator's perspective for risk management and participation planning of EVs in the smart grid for DR. The risk factors considered in this paper involve those caused by uncertainties in renewables (wind and solar), load patterns, parking patterns, and transmission lines' reliability.

The methodologies have proposed in contrast with the conventional algorithm in which the transmission line investment cost has been minimized without considering the dynamism of the deregulated environment. Moreover, the transmission network planning enhances the competitiveness of the power market, where more market players can participate. In this situation, the network planner has an important role in assessing the needs for transmission investments. Now-a-days practice of the network planner is to utilize more renewable power resources, PEVs and implementation of different electricity price tariffs. To achieve more benefits of PEVs and wind energy, their optimal utilization is a major concern. This paper proposes a mathematical model for solving the combined effect of PEVs and wind power integration with incentive-based DR program on static transmission network expansion planning (STNEP) problem. To solve this non-linear and non-convex problem, a nature-inspired optimization algorithm named gbest-guided artificial bee colony algorithm (GABC) is applied due to its robustness. The algorithm's performance is evaluated through modified IEEE 24-bus, Brazilian 46-bus and Colombian 93-bus system.

maybe,,Generation expansion planning by considering energy-efficiency programs in a competitive environment,"Restructuring of the electricity industry and the development of energy efficiency solutions are the two major developments of the recent power systems. Implementation strategies in the use of energy efficiency can be made by utilizing more energy-efficient equipment or increasing penetration rate of production of new sources of energy at the generating side. These new sources of energy can be renewable sources, especially wind resource and energy storage instruments such as grid-connected electric vehicles. The vehicles can be charged during the low load and discharged during peak load. In this study, wind resources and grid-connected electric vehicles are considered as an approach for energy efficiency strategies in generation expansion planning. But, because of high investment cost, great uncertainty of wind resources' productivity and uncertainty of their supportive policies no one will invest on them without proper supportive policies in a competitive environment. So support policies for wind resource are also considered. One of the fundamental problems of supportive policies is financial support in a competitive environment. Therefore, as an innovation of the paper, grid-connected electric vehicles is used to solve the problem. In the paper, the impact of these vehicles is considered in a way that they act integrated with wind resources and thus increases the capacity factor of wind resources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

maybe,,Simultaneous planning of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle charging stations and wind power generation in distribution networks considering uncertainties,"Recently, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) are becoming more attractive than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). Hence, design and modeling of charging stations (CSs) has vital importance in distribution system level. In this paper, a new formulation for PHEV charging stations is presented with the strategic presence of wind power generation (WPG). This study considers constraints of the system losses, the regulatory voltage limits, and the charge/discharge schedule of PHEV based on the social behavior of drivers for appropriate placement of PHEV charging stations in electricity grid. The role of CSs and WPG units must be correctly assessed to optimize the investment and operation cost for the whole system. However, the wind generation owners (WGOs) have different objective functions which might be contrary to the objectives of distribution system manager (DSM). It is assumed that aggregating and management of charge/discharge program of PHEVs are smartly carried out by DSM. This paper presents a long-term bi-objective model for optimal planning of PHEV charging stations and WPG units in distribution systems which simultaneously optimize two objectives, namely the benefits of DSM and WGO. It also considers the uncertainty of load growth, electricity price and PHEV access to the charging station using Mont-Carlo simulation (MCS) method. Initial state of charge uncertainty is also modeled based on scenario approach in PHEV batteries and wind turbine power generation using weibull distribution.

maybe,,Distributed generation integrated with thermal unit commitment considering demand response for energy storage optimization of smart grid,"This paper deals with an optimal battery energy storage capacity for the smart grid operation. Distributed renewable generator and conventional thermal generator are considered as the power generation sources for the smart grid. Usually, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is used to satisfy the transmission constraints but installation cost of battery energy storage is very high. Sometimes, it is not possible to install a large capacity of the BESS. On the other hand, the competition of the electricity market has been increased due to the deregulation and liberalization of the power market. Therefore, the power companies are required to reduce the generation cost in order to maximize the profit. In this paper, a thermal units commitment program considers the demand response system to satisfy the transmission constraints. The BESS capacity can be reduced by the demand response system. The electric vehicle (EV) and heat pump (HP) in the smart house are considered as the controllable loads of the demand side. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by extensive simulation results which ensure the reduction of BESS capacity and power generation cost, and satisfy the transmission constraints. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.renene.2016.06.050,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2016.06.050,10,high

maybe,,A Market Mechanism for Electric Vehicle Charging Under Network Constraints,"The increasing impact of electric vehicles on distribution networks can be alleviated by smart charging-the shifting of electric vehicle load to times when there is available capacity in the network. This work presents a market mechanism for smart charging that optimally allocates available charging capacity in a way that ensures network stability, while at the same time allowing vehicles to express individual preferences regarding their charging rates. Those who want higher rates can receive these, but must pay a higher price. The mechanism takes into account network-specific constraints such as total network load, voltage drop, and phase unbalance. However, since vehicles have differing impacts on these constraints, this leads to unequal access to the available resources (i.e., charging capacity), resulting in an unfair market. An additional constraint can be introduced to level the playing field for all users, but it leads to a reduction in aggregate performance. The mechanism is shown to be efficient and strategy-proof, so users cannot gain an unfair advantage by misrepresenting their preferences.

maybe,,Distribution planning with hourly profiles for analysing electric vehicle charging strategies,"This paper analyses the impact of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) on distribution networks. The reference network model (RNM) is used to model the grids and to carry out sensitivity analysis for several scenarios. The set of scenarios selected includes PEV penetration levels, charging strategies and location distributions. Each scenario is characterised in terms of the number of electric vehicles, the vehicles' class, technical parameters and charging time. Five large-scale real distribution networks are modelled and analysed. The topologies selected are intended to be representative of some typical European distribution networks. Results show that the charging strategies are critical. At least, new multi-Tariff schemes should be established to encourage charging at valley hours. Depending on the PEV location distribution, smart charging may also be necessary to reduce the distribution network costs further. © © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJEHV.2016.076959,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1504/ijehv.2016.076959,10,high
maybe,,Multi-objective distribution network expansion incorporating electric vehicle charging stations,"The paper develops a multi-objective planning framework for distribution network expansion with electric vehicle charging stations. Charging loads are modeled in the first place, and then integrated into the optimal distribution network expansion planning. The formulation is extended from the single objective of the economic cost minimization into three objectives with the additional maximization of the charging station utilization, and maximization of the reliability level. Compared with the existing models, it captures the interactive impacts between charging infrastructures planning and distribution network planning from the aspects of economy, utilization, and reliability. A multi-stage search strategy is designed to solve the multi-objective problem. The models and the strategy are demonstrated by the test case. The results show that the proposed planning framework can make a trade-off among the three objectives, and offer a perspective to effectively integrate the network constraints from both the transportation network and distribution network. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",10.3390/en9110909,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.3390/en9110909,10,high
maybe,,An integrated analysis for sustainable supply of remote winter tourist centers - A future concept case study,"In every power system there are consumer areas away from traditional power networks. Existing grid expansion can always be treated as one of the ways of powering them over long transmission and distribution lines. This is often characterized by significant transmission losses, as well as significant investments, depending on the distance and the infrastructure development. On the other hand, there are cases when these consumers are not connected to the power system and use alternative methods of supply. For that matter, possible solutions may use locally available energy sources. In this paper, comparative analyses between independent power supply through particular hybrid power system (HPS) configurations and the distribution network expansion option are performed. Storage, which represents a major problem in such HPS concepts today due to cost and capacity, is proposed to be in the accumulators of electric vehicles. In addition, an analytical methodology for selecting a sustainable solution for powering remote consumers was implemented. This analysis was verified with reference to a specific type of consumer, a winter tourist center, using real indicators and measured data on wind and solar energy potential at the site. It was shown that such an approach improves the selection of the most favorable sustainable supply solution and is suitable for consumers away from developed distribution networks, e.g., tourist centers, livestock pastures, and small factories.

maybe,,An optimization framework for the integrated planning of generation and transmission expansion in interconnected power systems,"Energy, and particularly electricity, has played and will continue to play a very important role in the development of human society. Electricity, which is the most flexible and manageable energy form, is currently used in a variety of activities and applications. For instance, electricity is used for heating, cooling, lighting, and for operating electronic appliances and electric vehicles. Nowadays, given the rapid development and commercialization of technologies and devices that rely on electricity, electricity demand is increasing faster than overall primary energy supply. Consequently, the design and planning of power systems is becoming a progressively more important issue in order to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in timely fashion, not only in developed countries but particularly in developing economies where electricity demand is increasing even faster. Power systems are networks of electrical devices, such as power plants, transformers, and transmission lines, used to produce, transmit, and supply electricity. The design and planning of such systems require the selection of generation technologies, along with the capacity, location, and timing of generation and transmission capacity expansions to meet electricity demand over a long-term horizon. This manuscript presents a comprehensive optimization framework for the design and planning of interconnected power systems, including the integration of generation and transmission capacity expansion planning. The proposed framework also considers renewable energies, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, demand-side management (DSM), as well as reserve and CO2 emission constraints. The novelty of this framework relies on an integrated assessment of the aforementioned features, which can reveal possible interactions and synergies within the power system. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a suite of case studies inspired by a real-world power system, including “business as usual” and “CO2 mitigation policy” scenarios. These case studies illustrated the adaptability and effectiveness of the framework at dealing with typical situations that can arise in designing and planning power systems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.014,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.014,10,high

However, in contrast to the convex case, it is generally unable to produce optimal solutions directly. In fact, solutions recovered from the dual may not only be suboptimal, but even infeasible. In this paper we concentrate on large scale mixed-integer programs with a specific structure that appears in a variety of application domains such as power systems and supply chain management. We propose a solution method for these structures, in which the primal problem is modified in a certain way, guaranteeing that the solutions produced by the corresponding dual are feasible for the original unmodified primal problem. The modification is simple to implement and the method is amenable to distributed computation. We also demonstrate that the quality of the solutions recovered using our procedure improves as the problem size increases, making it particularly useful for large scale problem instances for which commercial solvers are inadequate.

maybe,,Flexibility mechanisms and pathways to a highly renewable US electricity future,"This study explores various scenarios and flexibility mechanisms to integrate high penetrations of renewable energy into the US (United States) power grid. A linear programming model – POWER (Power system Optimization With diverse Energy Resources) – is constructed and used to (1) quantify flexibility cost-benefits of geographic aggregation, renewable overgeneration, storage, and flexible electric vehicle charging, and (2) compare pathways to a fully renewable electricity system. Geographic aggregation provides the largest flexibility benefit with ∼5–50% cost savings, but each region's contribution to the aggregate RPS (renewable portfolio standard) target is disproportionate, suggesting the need for regional-and-resource-specific RPS targets. Electric vehicle charging yields a lower levelized system cost, revealing the benefits of demand-side flexibility. However, existing demand response price structures may need adjustment to encourage optimal flexible load in highly renewable systems. Two scenarios with RPS targets from 20% to 100% for the US (peak load ∼729 GW) and California (peak load ∼62 GW) find each RPS target feasible from a planning perspective, but with 2× the cost and 3× the overgeneration at a 100% versus 80% RPS target. Emission reduction cost savings for the aggregated US system with an 80% versus 20% RPS target are roughly $200 billion/year, outweighing the $80 billion/year cost for the same RPS range.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.01.079,2016,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.01.079,10,high

However, the electric vehicles will increase the electricity consumption and might induce congestions in the transmission systems. In order to deal with the electricity consumption increase from the electric vehicle integration into the power system and maximize the social welfare, the optimal investments of the Nordic transmission system are studied.

The implementation of appropriate vehicle to grid energy management system can maximize the potential of electric vehicles to provide grid ancillary services. This paper proposes an optimal vehicle to grid planning and scheduling by utilizing a novel double layer multi-objective algorithm. This optimization algorithm utilizes the grid-connected electric vehicles to perform peak load shaving and load levelling services to minimize the power grid load variance in the first layer optimization. Meanwhile, the second layer optimization minimizes the reactive power compensation for grid voltage regulation and therefore, optimizes the vehicle to grid charger's capacitor sizing. The second layer optimization algorithm utilizes an approximated formula from the simulation of a vehicle to grid charger. The proposed vehicle to grid optimization algorithm considers various power grid and electric vehicle constraints for practicality purpose.

maybe,,Risk management and participation planning of electric vehicles in smart grids for demand response,"Demand response (DR) can serve as an effective tool to better balance the electricity demand and supply in the smart grid. It is defined as ""the changes in electricity usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns"" in response to pricing and incentive payments. This paper focuses on new opportunities for DR with electric vehicles (EVs). EVs are potential distributed energy resources that support both the grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid modes. Their participation in the time-based (e.g., time-of-use) and incentive-based (e.g., regulation services) DR programs helps improve the stability and reduce the potential risks to the grid. Smart scheduling of EV charging and discharging activities also supports high penetration of renewables with volatile energy generation. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model from the Independent System Operator's perspective for risk management and participation planning of EVs in the smart grid for DR. The risk factors considered in this paper involve those caused by uncertainties in renewables (wind and solar), load patterns, parking patterns, and transmission lines' reliability.

Implementation strategies in the use of energy efficiency can be made by utilizing more energy-efficient equipment or increasing penetration rate of production of new sources of energy at the generating side. These new sources of energy can be renewable sources, especially wind resource and energy storage instruments such as grid-connected electric vehicles. The vehicles can be charged during the low load and discharged during peak load. In this study, wind resources and grid-connected electric vehicles are considered as an approach for energy efficiency strategies in generation expansion planning. But, because of high investment cost, great uncertainty of wind resources’ productivity and uncertainty of their supportive policies no one will invest on them without proper supportive policies in a competitive environment. So support policies for wind resource are also considered. One of the fundamental problems of supportive policies is financial support in a competitive environment.

Sometimes, it is not possible to install a large capacity of the BESS. On the other hand, the competition of the electricity market has been increased due to the deregulation and liberalization of the power market. Therefore, the power companies are required to reduce the generation cost in order to maximize the profit.

Despite numerous advantages brought by the electrified transportation, it will place a profound impact on the power grids. However, the present EV planning studies have not paid enough attention to the grid impacts, concerns, and priorities. Therefore, a comprehensive multi-objective EV charging station planning framework is developed, which not only satisfies the EV users and the charging facility investors but which also maintains reliable grid operation. The voltage-dependent characteristic of the EV load has been taken into consideration. An index that is based on the system reactive power reserve has been introduced to compare relative voltage stability status in different cases. The proposed planning framework is tested and verified by building up a realistic case using EV prediction data and transportation data for the city of Brisbane.

maybe,,Value of the energy storage system in an electric bus fast charging station,"Electric buses (EBs) are undergoing rapid development because of their environmental friendliness. Different from private electric vehicles, EBs are scheduled by a public transport company and required to be charged as soon as possible during operation hours. Consequently, the implementation of fast charging stations (FCSs) is essential to support the operation of EBs. Usually, the size of an FCS is constrained by the residual capacity of the connected distribution network and the investment budget. An energy storage system (ESS) is considered as a potential supplement not only to reduce the network integration cost for FCSs but also to reduce the charging cost of EBs through electricity price arbitrage. To quantify the value of ESS in an electric bus FCS, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for optimal sizing and control of FCS and ESS is built. A simplification method is proposed to convert the MINLP problem to a linear one without any loss in optimality, which accelerates the solving process. Simulations are performed based on historical data of a practical FCS. Numerical results indicate that ESS can significantly help reduce the overall investment and charging cost of the FCS. Meanwhile, the parameters of investment cost, lifespan and time-of-use electricity price have significant influences on the overall value of ESS for an FCS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.058,2015,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.058,10,high

maybe,,Optimal scheduling of distributed battery storage for enhancing the security and the economics of electric power systems with emission constraints,"In this paper, the sustainable day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems with the integration of distributed energy storage devices is investigated. The main objective is to minimize the hourly power system operation cost with a cleaner, socially responsible, and sustainable generation of electricity. Emission constraints are enforced to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional thermal generating units. The stationary electric vehicles (EV) are considered as an example of distributed storage and vehicle to grid (V2G) technology is considered to demonstrate the bilateral role of EV as supplier and consumer of energy. Battery storage can ease the impact of variability of renewable energy sources on power system operations and reduce the impact of thermal generation emission at peak hours. We model the day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems as a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem for solving the hourly security-constraint unit commitment (SCUC). In order to expedite the real-time solution for large-scale power systems, we consider a two-stage model of the hourly SCUC by applying the Benders decomposition (BD). The Benders decomposition would separate the hourly generation unit commitment (UC) in the master problem from the power network security check in subproblem. The subproblem would check dc network security constraints for the given UC solution to determine whether a converged and secure dc power flow can be obtained. If any power network violations arise, corresponding Benders cuts are formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will continue until the network violations are eliminated and a converged hourly solution is found for scheduling the power generating units.

maybe,,Probabilistic ESS sizing and scheduling for improved integration of PHEVs and PV systems in residential distribution systems,"Environmental concerns and oil price volatility have created increased interest in smart grid green energy technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) arrays and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, these technologies have been found to have a significant impact on distribution networks in terms of secondary distribution transformer overloading and increased reverse power flow. Energy storage systems (ESSs) are thought to be an effective tool for mitigating these negative effects. The primary challenge in implementing ESS technology lies in the difficulty of determining the appropriate sizes and operating schedules for these units, given the uncertainties inherent in PV array production and PHEV demand. This paper presents a probabilistic sizing and scheduling methodology for ESSs to facilitate the integration of PHEVs and PV arrays in distribution networks, taking into account different sources of uncertainty present in the system. The technical and economic feasibility of the proposed design methodology has been validated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a variety of scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

maybe,,Economic analysis of unit commitment with distributed energy resources,"Abstract: Classic unit commitment (UC) is an important and exciting task of distributing generated power among the committed units subject to several constraints over a scheduled time horizon to obtain the minimum generation cost. Large integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in modern power system makes generation planning more complex. This paper presents the individual and collective impact of three distributed energy resources (DERs), namely, wind power generator as a renewable energy source, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and emergency demand response program (EDRP) on unit commitment. In this paper, an inconsistent nature of wind speed and wind power is characterized by the Weibull probability distribution function considering overestimation and underestimation cost model of the stochastic wind power. The extensive economic analysis of UC with DERs is carried out to attain the least total cost of the entire system. To obtain the optimum solution, Teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is employed to solve the unit commitment problem considering IEEE standard 10 unit test system in this study. It is found that the combined effect of wind power generator, plug-in electric vehicles and emergency demand response program on UC significantly lessen the total cost of the system. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.ijepes.2015.01.028,2015,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.ijepes.2015.01.028,10,high

This paper proposes a new method for evaluating the effect of integrating a large number of EVs on a power system and their impact on the network voltage profile via injecting reactive power into highly-loaded buses. A multi-objective optimization problem is developed to obtain the optimal siting and sizing of charging stations and renewable energy sources (RES). The optimization problem focuses on reducing power losses, improving voltage stability of the system and reducing charging costs of EVs. In order to increase the network load factor some coefficients are introduced. Such coefficients, which depend on wind speed, solar irradiance and hourly peak demand ratio in the load characteristic of day-ahead, help aggregators to charge their EVs in off-peak hours. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is used for solving the optimization problem.

Although many studies have introduced novel models to integrate distributed generation into high levels of EV-adoption scenarios, none has considered EV-embedded battery performance degradation and its economic effect on system planning. Based on well-established models and data to emulate the capacity fading of lithium-ion batteries, the current work presents a mixed-integer linear programming optimization framework with decision variables to size renewable energy resources (RESs) in modern microgrids. The objective function aims to minimize the total cost of the system while guaranteeing a profitable operation level of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) application, narrowing the gap between design stage and real-life daily operation patterns. Stochastic modeling is used to incorporate the effect of different uncertainties involved in the issue. A case study on a residential system in Okinawa, Japan, is introduced to quantitatively illustrate how a profitable V2G operation can affect RES sizing. The results reveal that accounting for the economic operation of EVs leads to the integration of significantly higher capacities of RESs compared with a sizing model that excessively relies on V2G and does not recognize battery-fading economics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.010,2015,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.010,10,high

This study presents a new formulation to determine the optimal size and location of PHEV charging stations to maximise the distribution system manager (DSM) benefit. A two-stage procedure has been considered to optimise PHEV charging station planning. In the first stage, the candidate locations and their size are determined based on: (i) the sum of benefits from the appropriate use of charging station for charging and discharging of vehicles and (ii) the benefit of providing spinning reserve and supplying the network's load demand at peak times by DSM.

Simultaneously, significant technological progress has been made in terms of control capability of grid assets [generators, controllable loads such as electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage systems], mostly exploiting the capabilities of power ?electronics. In this context, several advanced control solutions can be implemented, supporting and improving the robustness of the operation in terms of fast frequency and voltage control responses. In this article, the Portuguese islands are taken as a case study. Within the Madeira archipelago (Porto Santo and Madeira islands), two approaches were envisioned. For Porto Santo Island, the main goal is the sizing of a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) to avoid frequency stability problems. For Madeira Island, the objective relies on the exploitation of hydro resources through the quantification of the technical benefits resulting from variable speed hydro pumping stations that are able to provide primary frequency regulation services in the pump operation mode. In addition, this article also addresses the benefits of introducing EVs in Flores Island in the Azores Archipelago.

The decisive factors affecting charging load profile include the power curve, the duration, and the start time of each charging process. This paper introduces the charging traffic flow (CTF) as a discrete sequence to describe charging start events, where CTF contains both spatial and temporal properties of a charging load. A set of equations are proposed to build a probabilistic load model, followed by simulation iteration steps using a flow chart. The parameter identification method based on ant colony (AC) algorithms is then studied in depth, and the pheromone update and the state transition probability are used to implement route finding and city selection, respectively.

Due to regulatory and physical considerations, aggregators are necessary for EVs to participate in electricity markets. The aggregator combines the capacities of many EVs and bids their aggregated capacity into electricity markets. In this paper, an optimal bidding of ancillary services coordinated across different markets, namely regulation and spinning reserves, is proposed. This coordinated bidding considers electricity market uncertainties using fuzzy optimization. The electricity market parameters are forecasted using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The fuzzy set theory is used to model the uncertainties in the forecasted data of the electricity market, such as ancillary service prices and their deployment signals.

By growing such charging station networks, the power grid becomes more congested and, therefore, controlling charging requests should be carefully aligned with the available resources. This paper focuses on an EV charging network equipped with different charging technologies and proposes two frameworks. In the first framework, appropriate for large networks, the EV population is expected to constitute a sizable portion of the light duty fleets. This necessitates controlling the EV charging operations to prevent potential grid failures and distribute the resources efficiently. This framework leverages pricing dynamics in order to control the EV customer request rates and to provide a charging service with the best level of quality of service (QoS). The second framework, on the other hand, is more appropriate for smaller networks, in which the objective is to compute the minimum amount of resources required to provide certain levels of QoS to each class.

They can be an integral part of a microgrid. Ground vehicles have become more electrified over time, providing electrical power for the propulsion system (hybrid) and a complex suite of auxiliary power systems, enhancing their use in microgrids. Optimizing the microgrid system for performance and reliability considering many external loads and sources is a challenging problem. This is especially true when the plug-in vehicles may enter and leave the microgrid randomly becoming either sources or loads. The microgrid is a repairable system. Recent work has shown that multiple metrics are needed to fully account for the performance of repairable systems under uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a decision-based framework to design and maintain repairable systems for optimal performance and reliability using a set of metrics such as minimum failure free period (MFFP), number of failures in planning horizon, and cost. Optimal tradeoffs among a minimal set of metrics (MSOM) can be used in the design and maintenance of these systems. The optimal solution includes the initial design, the system maintenance throughout the planning horizon, and the protocol to operate the system. Critical remote military installations with plug-in vehicles connected to the microgrids require careful consideration of cost and repair strategies because of logistical challenges in performing repairs and supplying necessary spare parts in unsafe locations.

However, connecting EVs to the distribution network and recharging the EV batteries without any control may overload the transformers and cables during peak hours when the penetration of EVs is relatively high. In this study, a two level hierarchical control method for integrating EVs into the distribution network is proposed to coordinate the self-interests and operational constraints of two actors, the EV owner and Distribution system operator (DSO), facilitated by the introduction of the fleet operator (FO) and the grid capacity market operator (CMO). Unlike the typical hierarchical control system where the upper level controller commands the low level unit to execute the actions, in this study, market based control are applied both in the upper and low level of the hierarchical system. Specifically, in the upper level of the hierarchy, distribution system operator uses market based control to coordinate the fleet operator׳s power schedule. In the low level of the hierarchy, the fleet operator use market based control to allocate the charging power to the individual EVs, by using market based control, the proposed method considers the flexibility of EVs through the presence of the response-weighting factor to the shadow price sent out by the FO.

The main objective is to minimize the hourly power system operation cost with a cleaner, socially responsible, and sustainable generation of electricity. Emission constraints are enforced to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional thermal generating units. The stationary electric vehicles (EV) are considered as an example of distributed storage and vehicle to grid (V2G) technology is considered to demonstrate the bilateral role of EV as supplier and consumer of energy. Battery storage can ease the impact of variability of renewable energy sources on power system operations and reduce the impact of thermal generation emission at peak hours. We model the day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems as a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem for solving the hourly security-constraint unit commitment (SCUC). In order to expedite the real-time solution for large-scale power systems, we consider a two-stage model of the hourly SCUC by applying the Benders decomposition (BD). The Benders decomposition would separate the hourly generation unit commitment (UC) in the master problem from the power network security check in subproblem. The subproblem would check dc network security constraints for the given UC solution to determine whether a converged and secure dc power flow can be obtained. If any power network violations arise, corresponding Benders cuts are formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC.

Based on well-established models and data to emulate the capacity fading of lithium-ion batteries, the current work presents a mixed-integer linear programming optimization framework with decision variables to size renewable energy resources (RESs) in modern microgrids. The objective function aims to minimize the total cost of the system while guaranteeing a profitable operation level of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) application, narrowing the gap between design stage and real-life daily operation patterns. Stochastic modeling is used to incorporate the effect of different uncertainties involved in the issue. A case study on a residential system in Okinawa, Japan, is introduced to quantitatively illustrate how a profitable V2G operation can affect RES sizing. The results reveal that accounting for the economic operation of EVs leads to the integration of significantly higher capacities of RESs compared with a sizing model that excessively relies on V2G and does not recognize battery-fading economics.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.010,2015,"planning,uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.010,10,high

This article discusses the benefits of an address-level approach to estimating the impact of MHD charging loads and how the approach is implemented to identify and estimate MHD EV charging loads in the Otay Mesa area. Location plays a significant role in determining projected loads as fleet facilities are not uniformly distributed across an area. Large concentrations of vehicles, chargers, and dense facility clustering all have the potential to create loads exceeding hundreds of MW in localized areas. Hence, the need to understand the potential impact is significant.

maybe,,Integrated pricing strategy for coordinating load levels in coupled power and transportation networks,"The increasing popularity of electric vehicles and the development of dynamic wireless charging technology have strengthened the integration between the power system and transportation system. To coordinate the load levels of the coupled power distribution network and transportation network, we propose an integrated pricing strategy including road tolls and charging prices, which depend on the road traffic load rate in the transportation network and the bus load rate in the power distribution network, respectively. To accurately model the interdependency between the power distribution network and the transportation network, a proper interface equation is proposed. Considering data privacy, we adopt a distributed optimization. Furthermore, we present a power allocation strategy based on model predictive control to meet the charging requirements of different EVs. Correspondingly, the above ideas form a two-layer optimization strategy. Based on the integrated pricing strategy, the upper layer aims to minimize the power generation cost and transportation travel cost, while balancing the load levels. The lower layer distributes charging power to different EVs based on the total power demand from the interface equation between the power distribution network and the transportation network. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated pricing strategy for coordinating load levels in coupled networks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118100,2022,"grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118100,9,medium

Results indicate that Pd dopant is stably anchored on the $\text{T}_{\rm Pt}$ site of the PtS2 surface with a ${E}_{\rm b}$ of −2.34 eV. The adsorption performance of the Pd-doped PtS2 (Pd-PtS2) monolayer upon three SF6 decomposed species is in order as SO2 > SOF2 > SO2F2, with ${E}_{\rm ad}$ of −1.04, −0.84 and −0.19 eV, respectively. Thus, chemisorption is identified for the SO2 and SOF2 systems with remarkable increase of bandgap for the Pd-PtS2 monolayer by 0.044 and 0.041 eV, respectively, while physisorption is identified for the SO2F2 system with relatively smaller increase of bandgap by 0.029 eV. Moreover, an applied electric field can effectively modulate the charge-transfer for the gas adsorption systems, which manifests the strong potential of Pd-PtS2 monolayer as a field-effect transistor gas sensor for detection of SO2, SOF2 and SO2F2 with high sensing response.

Multistation integrated system (MSIS) can resolve the aforementioned power quality issues. In this article, a new topology for a MSIS is proposed, which uses soft open point as the key equipment of the system and adopts the hierarchical power supply mode for a data center, electric vehicle charging pile, and other function stations. Based on the topology of the MSIS and smooth switching of the converter control mode, a coordinated control strategy is proposed to control the working mode of each function station and further optimize the system operation conditions. The small signal model of the MSIS is derived, which can provide theoretical support for the stable operation of the system. The simulation results of two different application scenarios verify that the proposed topology of the MSIS and coordinated control strategy effectively improve the voltage level of the distribution network, enhance the reliability of sensitive load power supply, and ensure safe and reliable operation of the MSIS.

maybe,,Optimal Configuration of Hybrid AC/DC Distribution Network Considering the Temporal Power Flow Complementarity on Lines,"To mitigate the voltage violation and overloading caused by the integration of Distributed Generation (DG) and Electric Vehicle Charging (EVC) loads, a feasible solution is to convert some AC medium voltage distribution lines to DC ones and formulate an AC/DC hybrid distribution network, based on which flexible power shifting between lines can be achieved. However, the complementarity of power flows amongst AC/DC lines is hardly described and embedded in existing configuration optimization methods in which only the average loading or the variations of loading for a certain period is considered. Solution space will be geometrically increased if operation scenarios are fully simulated for configuration caused by the strong uncertainties of DGs and EVC loads. This paper proposes an analytic quantifiable method to describe the power complementarity between AC/DC lines. The Gaussian mixture model is used to depict the temporal correlation and uncertainties. The complementarity is calculated by the conditional probability of multi-dimensional joint probability density function of AC/DC hybrid lines. Accordingly, an optimal configuration method of hybrid AC/DC distribution network is proposed considering the complementarity of power flows on AC/DC lines, in which the size and location of Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) are optimized.

In order to accurately model the coupled network, this paper studies the dynamic network equilibrium to capture the temporally-dynamic interactions between PDNs and TNs. This equilibrium encapsulates the driver’s choices of route, departure time, and charging location, and the electricity price. In the TN, a dynamic traffic model with point queues is proposed to describe the spatial and temporal evolution of traffic flows that is congruent with established user equilibrium choices. In particular, the queues formed at charging stations are, for the first time, modeled by a point queue. In the PDN, the electricity prices are accurately determined from a second-order conic program with a guarantee of strong duality. After theoretically proving the existence of an equilibrium solution, an improved fixed-point algorithm based on extrapolation is also proposed to solve the equilibrium problem efficiently.

maybe,,Optimal Transactive Energy Trading of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations With On-Site PV Generation in Constrained Power Distribution Networks,"This paper presents a two-level transactive energy market framework, that enables energy trading among electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). At the lower level, the discharging capability of EVs and on-site PV generation are leveraged by individual EVCS for participating in the transactive trading with their peers. Once the lower-level trading is completed, EVCSs trade energy at the upper level through the power grid network managed by the distribution system operator (DSO). The upper-level market is cleared while satisfying the power distribution network constraints. A cooperative game-based model is proposed to model the energy trading among EVCSs. To this end, the asymmetric Nash bargaining method is applied to allocate the grand coalition’s payoff to each EVCS at the upper-level market, while a weighted proportional allocation method is used to allocate individual EVCS’s payoff to its respective EVs at the lower-level market. The upper-level market formulation is further decomposed into two subproblems representing an energy scheduling and trading subproblem which maximizes EVCS payoffs, and a bargaining subproblem which allocates EVCS payoffs.

Reactive power compensation from photovoltaic (PV) inverters and active power curtailment of PV output are commonly used to mitigate voltage-related problems. However, the charging/discharging flexibility of EVs can be used to avoid PV output curtailment and save energy motivating methods to coordinate EV charging with PVs. Unfortunately, a large number of control variables makes the centralized voltage control computationally expensive. In this work, a decentralized voltage control algorithm which considers the active and reactive power compensation from PV inverters and EVs is presented. The proposed approach helps to solve the voltage issues in a more effective way. The approach involves clustering of the distribution network based on modified modularity, an index that considers EV flexibility and prediction time period. A model predictive control (MPC)-based algorithm is proposed for each cluster to solve the voltage problem using the respective PVs and EVs, while ensuring that the EV charging demand is satisfied while contributing to the voltage regulation.

A multi-agent system (MAS) contains multiple, intelligent, and interconnected collaborating agents for solving a problem beyond the ability of a single agent. A smart grid (SG) combines advanced intelligent systems, control techniques, and sensing methods with an existing utility power network. For controlling smart grids, various control systems with different architectures have already been developed.

maybe,,Voltage stability analysis of distribution systems in presence of electric vehicle charging stations with coordinated charging scheme,Recent advancements in the electric vehicle (EV) battery technologies and the promotion of EVs through government policies has seen a drastic rise in the number of EVs on the road. This leads to a change in the load profile of distribution systems by altering the peak demand intervals from what is being forecast without the consideration of EVs. This necessitates a quantitative approach for determining the load profile in a scenario where the number of EVs are high. This paper addresses the planning and operation problem from the perspective of grid stability by determining the load profile of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and subsequently quantifying the impact of EVCS on the voltage profile of the distribution system. A coordinated charging strategy is used to determine the load profile of EVCS constrained by both grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) rulesets. voltage sensitivity factor (VSF) and Voltage Stability Index (VSI) were used to quantify the impact of the EVCS load profile on the distribution system.

maybe,,A fundamental unified framework to quantify and characterise energy flexibility of residential buildings with multiple electrical and thermal energy systems,"To date, the energy flexibility assessment of multicomponent electrical and thermal systems in residential buildings is hindered by the lack of adequate indicators due to the different interpretations, properties, and requirements that characterise an energy flexible building. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a fundamental energy flexibility quantification framework applicable to various energy systems commonly found in residential buildings (i.e., heat pumps, renewables, thermal and electrical storage systems). Using this framework, the interactions between these systems are analysed, as well as assessing the net energy cost of providing flexibility arising from demand response actions where onsite electricity production is present. A calibrated white-box model of a residential building developed using EnergyPlus (including inter alia a ground source heat pump, a battery storage system, and an electric vehicle) is utilised. To acquire daily energy flexibility mappings, hourly independent, and consecutive demand response actions are imposed for each energy system, using the proposed indicators. The obtained flexibility maps give insights into both the energy volumes associated with demand response actions and qualitative characteristics of the modulated electricity consumption curves. The flexibility potential of each studied energy system is determined by weather and occupant thermal comfort preferences as well as the use of appliances, lighting, etc. Finally, simulations show that zone and water tank thermostat modulations can be suitably combined to shift rebound occurrences away from peak demand periods. These insights can be used by electricity aggregators to evaluate a portfolio of buildings or optimally harness the flexibility of each energy system to shift peak demand consumption to off-peak periods or periods of excess onsite electricity generation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116096,2021,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116096,9,medium

In the region of urban, the growing penetration of electric vehicles and the corresponding fast charging techniques not only emerge an effective interface for the virtual power plant, but also emerge the vulnerable points for the cyber attack. Facing the complexity of the physical vehicle-grid system and the uncertainty of the communication network, the unified modelling with a cyber-physical operator is established in this work. By the implicit Runge-Kutta method, the cyber-physical dynamics of the vehicle-grid electrical system is narrowed in the finite-dimensional space, which mimics the latency and denial-of-service attacks with a discretized matrix. After that, the techniques of space transformation and the subspace mapping are introduced to further approximate the hybrid system by a reduced cyber-physical operator. The resulting operator simultaneously preserves the system structure and reduces the dimensions, which provides the opportunity for the extraction of dynamic indexes and the participation factor. The proposed cyber-physical operator has experimentally verified in the case studies as well as the disclosure of the multimodal vibration. It is found that the interface of open cyber network and the lower-inertia batteries inside the electric vehicles might become the potential attacking points for the integrated local energy system. By the malicious cyber attacks, the stability feature of the cyber-physical system could be reshaped to a multimodal shape, which injects inharmonious energy from the cyber network into the physical system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116432,2021,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116432,9,medium
maybe,,Grid and user-optimized planning of charging processes of an electric vehicle fleet using a quantitative optimization model,"The promotion of electric mobility is considered a counterreaction to climate change and is therefore subsidized by various countries. The possibility of charging individual electric vehicles at employer's premises enables the use of an electric vehicle for a large part of the population. In addition, solar radiation peaks during common working hours, resulting in economic and ecological advantages of locally installed photovoltaic systems at the workplace. As business-as-usual charging management is based on rudimentary rules, this power is not optimally used. Furthermore, high charging utilization may lead to high loads and thereby exceed the limitations of the respective building's grid connection capacity. Hence, an optimization approach for improved charging management is required. A non-linear optimization model for coordinated charging of electric vehicles within a local energy system, which consists of a building, a photovoltaic system and a variety of different electric vehicles, is developed in this work. Respective charging profiles take the maximum charging power as a function of the state of charge into account. The objective is to minimize the costs of the charging station operator, incorporating customer satisfaction via penalty costs. The optimization model results in increased consumption of locally provided photovoltaic power and lower electricity costs in most cases. For companies with limited grid connection, the implementation also allows for more vehicles to be charged simultaneously without extending the grid connection capacity.

Proliferation of EV in the markets depends on factors like price, battery technology, economy and development of fast charging stations. Fast charging stations are an important factor in EV market penetration. This paper focusses in designing fast charging solar hybrid EV charging station. To decrease dependence on the grid power and to increase profitability, the charging station includes a 100 kW solar power plant with storage. The paper presents a comprehensive model of the hybrid solar charging station. To determine the load on the station, a stochastic model is used to predict the arrival time, the SOC and the charging demand. Stochastic firefly algorithm (SFA) is used for MPPT control to obtain maximum power from the solar power plant and to ensure fast charging of the station batteries. The station is designed to supply power from the batteries during off-peak hours and from the grid during high peak hours. The paper also presents a multi-objective planning using SFA to minimize the investment cost and to increase the profit of the charging station. Results show that using SFA enables fast charging of the batteries and also increases the profit of the charging station.

We used GPS tracking and spatio-temporal data to assess the energy requirements of nine electric minibus taxis as well as the informal and formal stops at which the taxis can recharge. Given the region's abundant sunshine, we modelled a grid-connected solar photovoltaic charging system to determine how effectively PV may be used to offset the additional burden on the electrical grid. The mean energy demand of the taxis was 213kWh/d, resulting in an average efficiency of 0.93kWh/km. The stopping time across taxis, a proxy for charging opportunity, ranged from 7.7 h/d to 10.6 h/d.

In the first level of optimization, to minimize the cost of electricity, the operating time of smart home components is determined by SHEMS, and active power is exchanged between equipment. At this level, the impact of demand response (DR) constraints on the cost and load factor (LF) of the smart home have also been investigated. In the second level, considering the optimal cost obtained in the first level, in addition to the active power, the reactive power required by loads is also provided by using the additional capacity of EV and ESS inverters and improves the power factor (PF) of the house at the connection point to the grid. Day-ahead electricity costs are calculated depending on different pricing signals (TOU, RTP) with the power exchange capacity (buying/ selling) with the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is examined on a typical smart home over a 24-h. By reviewing the numerical results obtained for the cost and the LF in different scenarios, and observing the increase of the PF of home from 0.65 to 0.94 and also examining the performance of the equipment during the planning time, the efficiency of the model is proved. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.scs.2021.102972,2021,"planning,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.scs.2021.102972,9,medium

maybe,,Efficient Multi-Port Bidirectional Converter With Soft-Switching Capability for Electric Vehicle Applications,"In this paper, to solve the hard-switching operation problem and the lack of existing a bidirectional power flow path from output to the energy storage device of the conventional three-port converter, a new soft-switched bidirectional multi-port converter is proposed. A large number of switches, different power flow paths which vary in each operating mode, and changing the outputs and their power levels are some of the challenges to provide soft-switching conditions in multi-port converters. In the proposed converter, by changing the topology of the conventional three-port converter, the bidirectional power exchangeability between ports is provided. Moreover, a soft-switching cell is added, which can operate independently from the output power levels. Less number of components with low volume is one of the important features of this multi-port converter. Due to the soft-switching operation of the proposed converter, the size of passive components and heat-sink is reduced. In addition, by the use of coupled inductors in the soft-switching cell, only one magnetic core is used and thus, single-stage power conversion is achieved and conduction loss is reduced. In this paper, the converter operating modes are presented, and design considerations are discussed. Finally, a 200 W-200 V prototype is implemented, and the theoretical analysis is validated by the experimental results.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097750,2021,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2021.3097750,9,medium
maybe,,Designing Hybrid Vehicle Architectures: Utilizing an Automatic Generation and Optimization Approach,"Different architectures for hybrid powertrains exist. Traditionally, to compare their efficiency, one energetic model is developed per architecture and is optimized. Today, this heuristic approach can be replaced by a systematic method that explores all the possibilities in a defined search space. This article presents hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) optimization and comparison using an automatic methodology for architecture generation. The components of the series-parallel hybrid architecture, with the exception of planetary gears, are chosen as starting components. All possible architectures are generated and then filtered to determine the most promising ones. The latter are automatically assessed and optimized using a general hybrid model. The process includes a genetic algorithm (GA) for design optimization and dynamic programming (DP) for control optimization. Given two different objectives to minimize, namely, battery size and fuel consumption in our considered case, the Pareto fronts of the most promising architectures are presented and compared to the Pareto fronts of reference series-parallel architectures. Several of the filtered architectures are found to be better than the references (their consumption is roughly 5 \& percnt; lower), and a gain in powertrain sizing and cost is found.

maybe,,Model Predictive Control of a Three-Phase Two-Level Four-Leg Grid-Connected Converter Based on Sphere Decoding Method,"To achieve optimal control of four-leg grid-connected converters in terms of switching frequency and current tracking, the finite-control-set model-predictive-control method (FCS-MPC) can be applied. In this method, the cost function (CF) considers tracking control of grid current, filter capacitance voltage, and converter-side current as well as switching frequency before allocating different weights in its calculations. Thus, multiobjective optimization is achieved by trying to find the optimal switching sequence that minimizes the CF. However, as the horizon length is increased, the solution search enlarges exponentially, soon requiring an exhaustive search through each of many candidates. To alleviate this computational burden, this article presents an FCS-MPC method that is based on a new node-comparison sphere decoding method (NC-SDM), thereby reformulating the CF minimization problem into an integral-least-squares problem. The proposed NC-SDM reduces the computational burden associated with longer horizons by excluding as many suboptimal solutions from the candidates as possible. It does this by continuously comparing the length of two paths corresponding to each node of the search tree, and always taking the branch with shorter length. The final length of the total path is set as the initial radius after superposing all the path lengths. As a result, the initial radius estimation is much smaller than that in the Babai method and the computational cost is further reduced.

A properly sized HESS and an implementable real-time power management system are of great importance to achieve satisfactory driving mileage and battery cycle life. However, dimensioning and power management problems are quite complicated and challenging in practice. To address these challenges, this article proposes a bilevel multiobjective design and control framework with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II and fuzzy logic control (FLC) as key components, to obtain an optimal sized HESS and the corresponding optimal real-time power management system based on FLC simultaneously. In particular, a vectorized fuzzy inference system is devised, which allows large-scale fuzzy logic controllers to run in parallel, thereby improving optimization efficiency.

However, due to the wide variation range of battery voltages, applying conventional LLC resonant converters usually results in relatively larger magnetic size and lower power density. This article presents a novel approach to improve the power density performance of LLC resonant converters for EV charging. It leverages the existing capacitor-clamped LLC topology, which was originally proposed for applications needing overcurrent protection, while innovatively operating the converter in the capacitive (rather than inductive) region of conventional LLC resonant converters. Results in this work using our proposed design method show that when working in the capacitive region, the capacitor-clamped LLC converter can not only realize zero-voltage switching in the MOSFETs and zero-current switching in the output diodes but also significantly reduce the flux linkage requirement in the transformer compared to conventional LLC. This leads to an elegant solution that optimally minimizes the size of magnetics for increased power density while reducing costs. The merits of the capacitor-clamped LLC converter with the proposed design method are validated by a 400 W, 200 V input, 125–210 V output range prototype, which achieves an efficiency of 98.13% at the maximum output power.",10.1109/TPEL.2021.3068693,2021,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpel.2021.3068693,9,medium

A comprehensive model-dependent impact assessment is performed, including phase imbalances, neutral and ground wires and load dependencies. The de-congestion potential of common residential devices is highlighted, analyzing capabilities such as active power redistribution, reactive power support and phase balancing. Said potential is explored on setups where the DSO can make only partial adjustments on customer profiles, rather than (as is common) deciding on the full profiles. The extensive analysis can be used by DSOs and researchers alike to make informed decisions on the required levels of modelling detail, the connected devices and the degrees of controlability.

Residential EV adoption is treated as a multi-criteria decision making problem modeled via analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The customer adoption model CANE is developed considering customer characteristics including car age, EV attractiveness valued using logistic regression, neighbor influences and customer economics. Distribution feeder topology is combined with property geographic information system (GIS) parcels and household travel survey data to determine geographic and electric locations for EV and charging stations. A Monte Carlo method is utilized to obtain the most likely outcome of the stochastic vehicle decision-making process and perform model calibration. The proposed diffusion forecasting approach is demonstrated using actual distribution feeder data.

maybe,,Efficient Assignment of Electric Vehicles to Charging Stations,"In a large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) to the transportation sector, it becomes more challenging to provide an acceptable level of service to EV users who already suffer from EV's short range and long charging time. Because of the latter, charging facilities can be easily overloaded, leading to intolerable service delays. Achieving an acceptable level of service will require an extensive upgrade for power networks. However, it is necessary to make sure that existing charging resources are efficiently utilized before taking such expensive decision. In this paper, we provide a user-oriented EV control scheme based on the efficient assignment of EVs to charging stations. The key performance indicator is the average time spent by the user from requesting the charging service to accessing it. Our direction is thus opposing to that of the majority of EV-related studies which sacrifice user convenience for achieving utility benefits. The methodology we use depends on defining a queueing model to facilitate the management of a dynamic population of EVs, then developing an EV assignment algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization method.

In this article, an energy sharing model in the forms of hydrogen and electricity is proposed. In this integrated sharing system, besides the aggregators who own power-to-gas (P2G) devices, plug-in hybrid electric and hydrogen vehicles (PH2EVs) aggregators become the new coupling points of the electricity network and gas network, because they can either consume electricity or hydrogen. In the objective function, the total social welfare considering energy dispatch in different systems is maximized. The distributed optimization method is applied to solve the formulated problem. In this way, the privacy of each aggregator can be protected. When the aggregator solves its sub-problem, it is not necessary to obtain all the system information. Besides, the computational complexity is reduced through the distributed optimization. Simulations are conducted on a 35-bus electricity network coupled with a 15-bus gas network. The simulation results reveal that the sharing amount of different kinds of energy can be obtained and the unified market clearing prices of each kind of energy can be achieved.

Case studies are conducted under various settings. With the proposed model, using EVAs to mitigate uncertainties is achieved and is further classified into delaying uncertainties and eliminating uncertainties. As a result, average penalties for DISCO's deviations from its planned energy portfolio are reduced. Besides, EVA charging demands are shifted to hours with lower energy prices to reduce energy costs of DISCO. Using EVAs to mitigate uncertainties and shifting EVA charging demands are properly coordinated under the proposed model.

In this article, the fault operation behavior of a triple-redundant three-phase permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance machine (PMA-SynRM) is analyzed in detail. The mutual-coupling mechanism of different three-phase modules is explained by analyzing the magnetomotive force (MMF) distribution. It is found that the three-phase set module affects each other via an MMF offset component, causing second harmonics in the dq-axis currents, voltages, and torque.

During power outages, especially for elongated time spans, the locally available energy may not be sufficient to fulfill the energy needs of all the EVs. Therefore, a multicriteria EV prioritization scheme is proposed in this study to fairly allocate available energy among EVs during power outages. The five major factors considered for EV prioritization are trip purpose, EV occupants, energy gap, departure time, and customer behavior. With different combinations of the five prioritization factors, three indices are formulated, one each for social welfare, community wellbeing, and individual satisfaction of the EV owners. To this end, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated, based on the three indices, to allocate the available power among EVs with higher index values. The formulated multiobjective optimization problem is solved using the lexicographic method, which has superior performance over the conventionally used weighted-sum method and $\varepsilon $ -constraint (EC) method. The proposed method is not sensitive to the weights of individual functions and has the ability to handle multiple priority levels. In order to quantify the results, percent served and unserved indices are formulated for each of the three parameters (social welfare, community wellbeing, and individual satisfaction) and the results of the proposed method are compared with those of the weighted-sum method and the EC method. Sensitivity analysis of different uncertain factors, such as number of EVs, uncertainty in EV demand, uncertainty in renewable power, and error in battery state-of-charge estimation, is also carried out.

In this paper, leveraging blockchain technology, we first propose a privacy-preserving charging-station-to-vehicle (CS2V) energy trading scheme. The CS2V scheme is useful in crowded cities where there is a need for a charging infrastructure that can charge many EVs daily. We also propose a privacy-preserving vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy trading scheme. The V2V scheme is useful when charging stations are not available or far and cheaper prices can be offered from EVs, e.g., if they charge from renewable energy sources. In the V2V scheme, the privacy of both charging and discharging EVs including location, time, and amount of power are preserved. To preserve privacy in both schemes, EVs are anonymous, however, a malicious EV may abuse the anonymity to launch Sybil attacks by pretending as multiple non-exiting EVs to launch powerful attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting multiple reservations/offers without committing to them, to prevent other EVs from charging and make the trading system unreliable. To thwart the Sybil attacks, we use a common prefix linkable anonymous authentication scheme, so that if an EV submits multiple reservations/offers at the same timeslot, the blockchain can identify such submissions. To further protect the privacy of EV drivers, we introduce an anonymous and efficient blockchain-based payment system that cannot link individual drivers to specific charging locations.

In particular, a considerable share of this flexibility may be dispatched to secure post-fault transient frequency dynamics. Pursuant to the unprecedented changes to the traditional portfolio of generation sources, this work presents a detailed analysis of the potential system-level value of unlocking flexibility from nuclear electricity production. A rigorous enhanced mixed integer linear programming (MILP) unit commitment formulation is adopted to simulate several generation-demand scenarios where different layers of flexibility are associated to the operation of nuclear power plants.

In comparison to related studies, we use a simulation model for energy planning with a high time-resolution from the perspective of the energy system planner. In this study, we address the challenges of the grid connection in combination with an increasing number of electric vehicles (EV) in the future. The here developed model is applied for an innovative building block in Germany with a photovoltaic (PV) system, a combined heat and power (CHP) unit, battery storage and electric vehicles. The results of the simulation are validated with real-life data to illustrate the practical relevance and show that our simulation model is able to support the planning of decentralised energy systems. We demonstrate that without anticipating future electric vehicle charging, the system configurations could be sub-optimal if complete self-sufficiency is the objective: in our case study, the rate of self-sufficiency of the net-zero energy building will be lowered from 100% to 91% if considering electric vehicles. Furthermore, our simulation shows that a peak minimising operation strategy with a battery can prevent grid overloads caused by EV charging in the future.

maybe,,Integration of energy markets in microgrids: A double-sided auction with device-oriented bidding strategies,"Energy trading markets are one of the most viable solutions to incentivize prosumers in Microgrids. They offer the utility a versatile access for flexible loads coordination without violating the consumer privacy. In the literature, several models and designs were presented to address different aspects of energy trading markets, yet there is a gap between these models and their application in real-life. This paper describes a novel discrete-timely double-sided auction model that facilitates energy trading between prosumers in near real-time and forward markets. Since the practical realization of the model represents a crucial criterion for this model, the market is designed with fast clearing mechanism and simple bidding rules that guarantee the benefits of the prosumers, their privacy, and consider their personal preferences. Additionally, a decentralized home energy management approach is followed at the prosumer level to maximize the system reliability and enable an easy integration of multiple devices from different manufacturers. Hence, a device-oriented bidding strategy is demonstrated that considers the physical characteristics and technical limitations of each device type such as electric vehicles (EV), micro-combined heat and power systems (micro-CHP) or heat pumps.

maybe,,A novel probabilistic framework to study the impact of photovoltaic-battery systems on low-voltage distribution networks,"Battery storage, particularly residential battery storage coupled with rooftop photovoltaics (PV), is emerging as an essential component of the smart grid technology mix. However, including battery storage and other flexible resources like electric vehicles and loads with thermal inertia into a probabilistic analysis based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is challenging, because their operational profiles are determined by computationally intensive optimization. Additionally, MC analysis requires a large pool of statistically-representative demand profiles to sample from. As a result, the analysis of the network impact of PV-battery systems has attracted little attention in the existing literature. To fill these knowledge gaps, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic framework to study the impact of PV-battery systems on low-voltage distribution networks. Specifically, the framework incorporates home energy management (HEM) operational decisions within the MC time series power flow analysis. First, using available smart meter data, we use a Bayesian nonparametric model to generate statistically-representative synthetic demand and PV profiles. Second, a policy function approximation that emulates battery scheduling decisions is used to make the simulation of optimization-based HEM feasible within the MC framework. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on three representative low-voltage feeders, where the computation time to execute our MC framework is 5% of that when using explicit optimization methods in each MC sample. The assessment results show that uncoordinated battery scheduling has a limited beneficial impact, which is against the conjecture that batteries will serendipitously mitigate the technical problems induced by PV generation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113669,2019,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113669,9,medium

The complexity of this problem has increased in recent years given the emergence of new participants such as large penetration of plug-in electric vehicles. In this paper, a new model is established for simultaneously considering the day-ahead hourly based power system scheduling and a significant number of plug-in electric vehicles charging and discharging behaviours. For solving the problem, a novel hybrid mixed coding meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed, where V-shape symmetric transfer functions based binary particle swarm optimization are employed. The impact of transfer functions utilised in binary optimization on solving unit commitment and plug-in electric vehicle integration are investigated in a 10 unit power system with 50,000 plug-in electric vehicles. In addition, two unidirectional modes including grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid, as well as a bi-directional mode combining plug-in electric vehicle charging and discharging are comparatively examined. The numerical results show that the novel symmetric transfer function based optimization algorithm demonstrates competitive performance in reducing the fossil fuel cost and increasing the scheduling flexibility of plug-in electric vehicles in three intelligent scheduling modes. © 2018",10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.165,2019,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.165,9,medium

Considering that the decision-making process faced by the power system planner must simultaneously consider long- and short-term uncertainties, a three-stage stochastic programming problem is formulated. In this model, capacity investments and financial incentives for PEV users are decided in the first stage, whereas operating decisions regarding the day-ahead and real-time markets are made in the second and third stages, respectively.

A realistic fleet model is proposed, which emulates the aggregated response of a number of EVs characterized by V2G hardware response times derived in laboratory tests. The effects of primary frequency control via EV fleets replacing conventional generating units are assessed with a sensitivity study in a single-bus power system with growing fleet sizes and response times. Two recommendations are derived to guarantee safe and stable operation: Recommendation 1 requires the share of EVs providing primary reserve to be smaller than the reserve from conventional units; Recommendation 2 requires response times below a given limit value, calculated as a function of the following power system parameters: the system inertia, the total primary reserve over the rotating generation capacity, and the employed droop gain.

maybe,,Optimal distribution feeder reconfiguration and generation scheduling for microgrid day-ahead operation in the presence of electric vehicles considering uncertainties,"Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration (DFR) and Optimal Generation Scheduling (OGS) are indispensable operation tasks that are used in Microgrids (MGs) to enhance efficiency as well as technical and economic features of MGs. The OGS problem usually minimizes the cost of energy assuming a fixed configuration of power systems. On the other hand, the DFR problem is done assuming a predefined generation of units. However, performing these two tasks separately may lose the optimal solution. In this paper, a framework is proposed to jointly perform OGS and optimal DFR on a day-ahead time frame. The total operation cost of MG is minimized subject to diverse technical and economic constraints. The Demand Response (DR) program offered by curtailable loads is considered as a Demand Side Management (DSM) tool. The Electric Vehicles (EVs) and non-dispatchable Distributed Generations (DGs) are modeled along with the uncertainty of MG components. The charging pattern of EVs is modeled in two ways including uncontrolled and controlled patterns. The objective function includes the cost of purchasing active/reactive power from the upstream grid as well as DGs, cost of switching in DFR, cost of DR, and cost of energy losses. MG profit from selling electric energy to the upstream grid is also incorporated in the objective function.

maybe,,Two-stage hybrid stochastic/robust optimal coordination of distributed battery storage planning and flexible energy management in smart distribution network,"This paper presents a two-stage formwork for the coordinated distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESSs) planning and the flexible energy management (FEM) in a smart distribution network (SDN) in the presence of electric vehicles’ (EVs’) parking lot and variable renewable energy sources (VRESs). In the first stage, from distribution system operator's (DSO's) viewpoint, the linear DBESSs planning problem minimizes the difference between summation of its investment, degradation and charging costs and its revenue due to injecting power into the network at the discharging mode, where this problem subjects to the linear SDN optimal power flow equations and VRES, DBESS and EVs’ parking lot constraints. Noted that the bounded uncertainty–based robust model (BURM) is used to model the uncertainty of load, charging/discharging price, VRES power and EV parameters according to the uncertainty levels. In addition, the FEM strategy is applied to the SDN to obtain the suitable flexibility, security and operational indices based on the second stage problem formulation. This strategy minimizes the difference between energy cost paid to the upstream network and flexibility benefit from DSO and flexibility operator (FO) viewpoints while it considers linear AC optimal power flow and renewable and flexible sources equations as problem constraints. Moreover, in order to achieve the robust flexibility capability of EVs’ parking lot in the SDN, the uncertainty of the FEM strategy is modelled in the proposed hybrid stochastic/robust optimization. Hence, the scenario-based stochastic programming (SBSP) is used for the uncertain parameters of load, energy price and VRES power, but, BURM models the EVs uncertainty. Finally, the proposed two-stage formwork is simulated on the 19-bus LV CIGRE benchmark grid using GAMS software to investigate the capability and efficiency of the model. According to numerical results, the proposed strategy calculates the optimal location and size for DBESSs depending on the energy price, consumers and EVs demand and VRESs size in the SDN, and thus, it can obtain flexible, secure and efficient operation indices in this network based on the lowest possible cost for the investment of DBESSs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.est.2019.100970,2019,"planning,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.est.2019.100970,9,medium

Results are high-resolution maps (0.02 km2) that allow distribution network planners to forecast asymmetric changes in load patterns and assess resulting impacts on installed HV/MV substation transformers in distribution systems. A risk analysis routine identifies the investment that minimizes the maximum regret function for a 15-year planning horizon. One of the outcomes from this study shows that traditional approaches to allocate distributed energy resources in distribution networks underestimate the impact of adopting EV and PV on the grid.

maybe,,Cost Competitiveness of Electrolytic Hydrogen,"Hydrogen is often considered an energy carrier of the future in part because of the costs to implement a hydrogen-based system. However, using 7,182 industrial and commercial US retail electric utility rates, this study dynamically simulates electrolyzer operations under different utility rate structures and shows that electrolysis units can already provide cost-competitive fuel in 20 states operating under 81 retail electricity rates. Our analysis shows that current hydrogen production costs range from US$2.6 to US$12.3 kg−1 and can be significantly reduced through flexible operation if dynamic tariffs are used. Hydrogen production costs for the 81 utility rates in 20 states are already less than US$4.0 kg−1 and competitive with the fuel cost of gasoline vehicles. Thus, under the right conditions, hydrogen fuel is already cost competitive in the US energy sector and has several interesting possible roles to play in future energy and transportation systems.; Hydrogen, which is a flexible energy carrier, has the potential to enable the accommodation of high shares of wind and solar energy sources within power systems and facilitate the integration of disparate energy sectors, e.g., electricity and transportation sectors. However, because of the high cost to implement hydrogen-based energy systems, hydrogen is usually considered as an energy carrier of the future. Indeed, hydrogen production cost calculations are often oversimplified by using annual average electricity cost by state or region, which does not allow for location-specific value assessments. This study assesses the production cost of grid-based electrolytic hydrogen across the United States and finds that hydrogen can already be cost effective today. Additionally, the value of flexible operation under dynamic electricity rates is also evaluated, and technological, policy, and regulatory advances and efforts required for widespread adoption of hydrogen technologies are discussed.; By performing the optimization of 1 MW electrolyzer over a set of ∼7,000 electric utility rates, this study evaluates the production cost of grid-based electrolytic hydrogen across the United States. We also explore the effects of flexible operation and tariff structure on the hydrogen production cost. Then, by comparing fuel costs for hydrogen, gasoline, and diesel vehicles, we find that hydrogen can already be cost competitive today.

With the increasing level of intermittent wind and solar generation replacing the conventional power plants, there is a growing trend to involve electricity consumers in the balancing activity between the generation and consumption. In this paper, a bi-level demand response scheduling framework is proposed for residential load aggregators in which the planning scope spans a diverse set of loads and activities including inflexible loads, electric vehicles, air conditioning and water heating TCLs, energy storage system, and energy and regulation service scheduling on a residential distribution feeder with relevant constraints. Novel aggregation mechanism is proposed to capture the flexibility of heterogeneous loads based on clustering concept. In particular, the aggregation model of rapidly-growing inverter-based TCLs is derived using the proposed clustering techniques. Also, participation in regulation service market is based on the performance-based compensation scheme adopted by ISOs. The presented approach is applicable to day-ahead and real-time markets with a reliably fast calculation process.

maybe,,A modal-based approach for estimating electric vehicle energy consumption in transportation networks,"Electric vehicles (EVs) will play a central role in future energy-efficient and sustainable transportation systems. Compared to the operation of conventional vehicles, EVs provide significantly reduced energy consumption and lower operating costs. With conventional vehicles, fuel use ties directly to the instantaneous energy consumption required to provide motive power to the wheels. Predicting the energy use can be much more complex for EVs with hybridized powertrains because the onboard vehicle systems are trying to balance the provision of power to the wheels as well as manage the state of charge (SOC) of the battery pack. Traditional modeling methodologies for estimating real-world vehicle energy consumption either depend on numerical analysis of laboratory or on-road vehicle test data or the use of full-system simulation tools. Unfortunately, full-system simulation tools suffer from scaling problems in the context of large transportation network, necessitating the development of approaches that support large transportation network projections of modal EV operations and applicable modal energy use rates (energy use for various on-road modes of operation) to predict EV energy consumption. In this study, a new modal-based approach for estimating EV energy consumption is proposed. The modal-based approach considers the variance of vehicle operating conditions and supports energy estimation for large-scale transportation networks. The Department of Energy's full-system vehicle simulation tool known as Autonomie® is used to generate energy consumption rates for specific simulations of on-road operating conditions. A sample of EV models was first developed in Autonomie® to simulate a wide range of operating conditions and generate energy use rates for selected EVs. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was then applied to the simulation output data to generate energy consumption rates under distinct on-road operating conditions, as represented by combinations of vehicle speed, acceleration rate, and battery state of charge (SOC). A large-scale regional travel demand analysis was performed for the Atlanta, GA metropolitan area, integrating a variety of EV market share scenarios. The CART-derived energy consumption rates are then applied to the model-predicted link-by-link traffic attributes to estimate fleet energy consumption. The modeling framework employs MOVES-embedded driving cycles to represent on-road operations for average speed operating conditions and random initial SOC start levels as model inputs. The model results suggest a 50% PHEV market share can achieve a 30% energy savings without significantly adding to electricity load. This modeling approach can be used to assess network-level energy use for a wide-variety of modeled transportation studies, such as evaluating transportation improvement plans, assessing the net impact on the electric grid, and forecasting the potential benefits of electrifying shared-autonomous vehicles under future scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.001,2019,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.001,9,medium

This work proposes a price-based VPP with a two-class EV-charging tariff while managing the charging impact on the distribution network. Similar to a generating unit, EVs that participate through a day-ahead schedule will be charged differently than EVs that do not participate in day-ahead scheduling. The objective of this work is to maximise benefits to both the DSO and the consumer. To achieve mutual benefits, in addition to power system constraints, this work incorporates the impact of consumer dissatisfaction due to delayed charging. This is achieved by modelling dissatisfaction as a function of anxiety. This work proposes an unplanned charging unit cost to ensure that both consumer welfare and DSO welfare are jointly accomplished.

In addition to conventional DGs and the upstream power grid, renewable generation including wind turbines and photovoltaic systems, energy storage systems, and curtailable loads are considered as components of the VPP. The proposed maintenance scheduling scheme provides different advantages in viewpoints of cost and reliability. Moreover, risk management is also investigated to lower the risk of maintenance scheduling due to the uncertainty in price in an energy market by adopting the conditional value at risk as a measure of risk.

On the one hand, EV can relieve the peak load of a smart grid and improve the electricity system operation. On the other hand, EV’s electricity trading information can provide useful data for vehicle management departments to electricity scheduling. However, hackers can easily obtain data from the central database to simulate both parties involved, which leads to the receiver getting unauthorized information. For these challenges, we propose a novel secure electricity trading and incentive contract model based on the basic rules of China’s electricity market. The digital signature technology adopts elliptic curve bilinear pairing to guarantee the reliability and integrity of the transaction information. Energy blockchain is utilized for encryption and distributed storage of energy data with the possession of tamper-proof and traceability. The consistency part of the data block applies a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant (PBFT) algorithm, which not only increases transaction throughput but also reduces transmission delay.

maybe,,Impact of Sampling in the Operation of Vehicle to Grid and Its Mitigation,"Governments across the world have plans for a deep penetration of electric vehicles in the near future, for the transportation sector. This will require robust communications between the entities of the charging infrastructure, viz., the grid, aggregators, controllers, charging stations (CSs) and the electric vehicles (EVs). For analyzing the vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle infrastructure, it is important to model the electrical as well as the communication network together. This will help in determining the influences of the communication network in the operation of the controller and grid. In this paper, a distribution system with five CSs and sampled data transmission between the entities are modeled and simulated in MATLAB Simulink for understanding the potential impact of the networked communication system on the grid operation.

A computationally efficient procedure with a detailed modeling of the network is sought. The objective is to obtain a charging schedule for all the EVs connected to the network satisfying a set of network operational constraints. The approach uses a complete AC three-phase modeling of the network and deploys a time-series power flow coupled with a greedy heuristic to obtain a smart charging procedure over a fixed planning period considering the variable behavior of loads and EV connection patterns.

To minimize future capital expenditure, improved DT design approaches are required. Therefore, a novel DT design approach based on a new paradigm of 'designing for maximum utilization' is proposed. It incorporates manufacturer and customer-sourced empirical data to achieve a desired DT retirement age and utilization rate, and allows for transient operation beyond DT nameplate rating through accurately accounting for thermal inertia. The novelty of the proposed approach derives from not only a new notion of designing for maximum utilization, but also allowing for the fact that winding insulation may not be the most critical factor affecting a DT's lifetime. Using the proposed approach, DT capital expenditure and utilization constraints can be optimized at a planning stage.

An aggregator can provide frequency regulation by controlling its generation and demand. Here we investigate the participation of an aggregator controlling a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) and an energy storage (ES) in day-ahead regulation and energy markets and determine the optimal size of the aggregator's bids. The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model, taking into account the uncertainties regarding energy and frequency regulation prices. The risks associated with the uncertainties are managed using the conditional value-at-risk method. Because most EVs are charged in residential distribution networks, load flow constraints are also taken into account. A linear formulation based on the rainflow cycle counting algorithm is proposed to include the ES degradation costs incurred from following the frequency regulation signals into the objective function. The problem is studied within the context of a medium-voltage distribution network adopting the market rules of the California Independent System Operator.

The complication is due to energy and time related constraints of PEVs that requires the complex non-linear time-coupled DOPF problem to be solved over a long period of few hours (e.g., 24-h). This paper presents a novel time-decoupled framework for solving the generation scheduling problem in IMGs by relaxing the time correlated constraints of the DOPF. The relaxation is mathematically achieved by replacing the time-coupled constraints with their corresponding long term time averages. This will resolve the time coupling property of DOPF and results in a simpler solution approach. The relaxed DOPF problem can be solved in independent time periods while considering other constraints such as PEVs and security constraints of OPF as well as factories constraints.

To incentivize EVs to trade charging/discharging energy, auction theory is employed to guarantee three economic properties: 1) truthfulness; 2) individual rationality; and 3) social cost minimization. The mechanism is designed according to the topology of an active distribution system, in which multiple microgrids (MGs) are networked through a distribution network (DN). Two types of V2G auctions are proposed for the MG and DN, respectively. In each auction, the auctioneer optimizes control of EVs' charging/discharging by solving a social cost minimization problem subject to constraints of power network topology. Further, the mechanism uses analytic target cascading framework, allowing the MG and DN to set up their own V2G auctions separately, and meanwhile enabling them to coordinate with each other to determine DN-MG power exchange. It is theoretically proved that the mechanism's three economic properties hold in both the cases of grid-tied MGs and islanding MGs. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can regulate voltages of the distribution system to a secure range.

The paper uses several Unit Commitments (UC) models which incorporate high levels of wind power production, applying different methods to tackle the renewables’ uncertainty. The selected power system is IEEE RTS 96. The UC models are further extended to integrate the EVs. Our focus is to assess the EVs impact on the total operating cost and the power grid adequacy to handle the extra load, by examining different charging profiles and penetration levels of EVs with the different UC models. Simulation results show that an optimized charging strategy is considerably more efficient than the random charging strategy, both in the total operating cost and the ability to integrate more EVs. The comparison between the UC models show that the most robust UC model leads to higher total operating cost, due to its more conservative methodology to tackle the stochastic nature of wind. There exists a non-linear trade-off between power system robustness and the total operating cost, depending on each power system characteristics, affecting also the penetration level of EVs. © 2019, Econjournals.

In recent years, the boost of internal combustion engine (ICE) based vehicles leads to the fossil fuel shortage and environmental pollution, bringing significant contributions to the greenhouse gas emissions. One of the effective ways to solve problems is to use electric vehicles (EVs) to replace the ICE based vehicles. However, the mass rollout of EVs may cause severe problems to the power system due to the huge charging power and stochastic charging behaviors of the EVs drivers. The accurate model of EV charging load forecasting is, therefore, an emerging topic. In this paper, four featured deep learning approaches are employed and compared in forecasting the EVs charging load from the charging station perspective.

When wind power producers (WPPs) bid in the day-ahead electricity market, how to deal with the deviation between forecasting output and actual output is one of the important topics in the design of electricity market with WPPs. This paper makes use of a non-probabilistic approach-Information gap decision theory (IGDT)-to model the uncertainty of wind power, and builds a robust optimization scheduling model for wind-storage-electric vehicles(EVs) hybrid system with EV participations, which can make the scheduling plan meet the requirements within the range of wind power fluctuations. The proposed IGDT robust optimization model first transforms the deterministic hybrid system optimization scheduling model into a robust optimization model that can achieve the minimum recovery requirement within the range of wind power output fluctuation, and comprehensively considers each constraint. The results show that the wind-storage-EVs hybrid system has greater operational profits and less impact on the safe and stable operation of power grids when considering the uncertainty of wind power.

maybe,,Location and sizing of battery energy storage units in low voltage distribution networks,"Proper planning of the installation of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) in distribution networks is needed to maximize the overall technical and economic benefits. The limited lifetime and relatively high cost of BESSs require appropriate decisions on their installation and deployment, in order to make the best investment. This paper proposes a comprehensive method to fully support the BESS location and sizing in a low-voltage (LV) network, taking into account the characteristics of the local generation and demand connected at the network nodes, and the time-variable generation and demand patterns. The proposed procedure aims to improve the overall network conditions, by considering both technical and economic aspects. An original approach is presented to consider both the planning and scheduling of BESSs in an LV system. This approach combines the properties of metaheuristics for BESS sizing and placement with a greedy algorithm to find viable BESS scheduling in a relatively short time considering a specified time horizon, and the application of decision theory concepts to obtain the final solution. The decision theory considers various scenarios with variable energy prices, the diffusion of local renewable generation, evolution of the local demand with the integration of electric vehicles, and a number of planning alternatives selected as the solutions with top-ranked objective functions of the operational schedules in the given scenarios.

maybe,,A multi-market-driven approach to energy scheduling of smart microgrids in distribution networks,"In order to coordinate the economic desire of microgrid (MG) owners and the stability operation requirement of the distribution system operator (DSO), a multi-market participation framework is proposed to stimulate the energy transaction potential of MGs through distributed and centralized ways. Firstly, an MG equipped with storage can contribute to the stability improvement at special nodes of the distribution grid where the uncertain factors (such as intermittent renewable sources and electric vehicles) exist. The DSO is thus interested in encouraging specified MGs to provide voltage stability services by creating a distribution grid service market (DGSM), where the dynamic production-price auction is used to capture the competition of the distributed MGs. Moreover, an aggregator, serving as a broker and controller for MGs, is considered to participate in the day-ahead wholesale market. A Stackelberg game is modeled accordingly to solve the price and quantity package allocation between aggregator and MGs. Finally, the modified IEEE-33 bus distribution test system is used to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed multi-market mechanism.

This presents a big challenge for further mass roll-out of electric vehicles. To assess the impact of charging of substantial number of electric vehicles on the grid, a model of 30000 PEVs integrated with unit commitment (UCEV) was investigated in this study. The unit commitment was a large-scale, mixed-integer, nonlinear, NP-Hard (non-deterministic polynomial) optimization problem, while the integration of PEVs further increased the complexity of the model. In this paper, a global best inspired negatively correlated search (GBNCS) method which extends the evolutionary logic of negatively correlated search is proposed to tackle the UCEV problem. In the proposed algorithm, a rounding transfer function in GBNCS, is deployed to convert real-valued variables into binary ones; further, the global best information is combined in the population to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Numerical results confirmed that the proposed GBNCS can achieve good performance in both a basic IEEE 10 unit commitment problem and the UCEV problem.

maybe,,Extended opportunity cost model to find near equilibrium electricity prices under non-convexities,"This paper finds near equilibrium prices for electricity markets with non-convexities due to binary variables, in order to reduce the market participants’ opportunity costs, such as generators’ unrecovered costs. The opportunity cost is defined as the difference between the profit when the instructions of the market operator are followed and when the market participants can freely make their own decisions based on the market prices. We use the minimum complementarity approximation to the minimum total opportunity cost model, from previous research, with tests on a much more realistic unit commitment model than in previous research, including features such as reserve requirements, ramping constraints, and minimum-up and -down times. The developed model incorporates flexible price-responsive demand, as in previous research, but since not all demand is price responsive, we consider the more realistic case that total demand is a mixture of fixed and flexible. Another improvement over previous minimum total opportunity cost research is computational: whereas the previous research had nonconvex terms among the objective function’s continuous variables, we convert the objective to an equivalent form that contains only linear and convex quadratic terms in the continuous variables, thus allowing for efficient optimization by CPLEX. We compare the unit commitment model with the standard social welfare optimization version of unit commitment, in a series of sensitivity analyses, varying flexible demand to represent varying degrees of future penetration of electric vehicles and smart appliances, different ratios of generation availability, and different values of transmission line capacities to consider possible congestions. The minimum total opportunity cost and social welfare solutions are mostly very close in different scenarios, except in some extreme cases; the obtained solution has smaller opportunity costs than social welfare, at very little cost in reduction of social welfare; and solution times of the minimum total opportunity cost model are longer, due to a larger model size, but the times are still very quick for practical use.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.059,2019,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.059,9,medium

maybe,,Minimizing static VAR compensator capacitor size by using SMC and ASRFC controllers in smart grid with connected EV charger,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) play a pivotal role in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases in the world. Currently demand for EVs has abruptly increased for transportation and other applications. Using more EVs causes an increasing load on the power system. Random EV charging yields voltage distortion, which results in an unbalanced grid. In a distributed system, the connection of EVs to the grid may diminish the power factor, which increases the apparent power loss. The Static VAR Compensator (SVC), which is a FACTS device, is applied to the power system to compensate the voltage distortions and apparent power loss. In this paper, two controlling methods are contemplated and tested in a SVC to reduce the apparent power loss and minimize the capacitor size of the SVC in comparison with the conventional control method in a SVC. Proposed methods are also compared with the conventional control method used for SVC.

maybe,,Risk-involved participation of electric vehicle aggregator in energy markets with robust decision-making approach,"Uncertainty of different parameters in power systems can put market players at risk. For example, uncertainty of market prices in energy markets with capitalist characteristics can negatively affect decisions of aggregators participating in such markets to make profits. In fact, uncertainty in capitalist energy markets should be controlled since many individuals who participate in such markets have specific expectations (economic goals in most cases) and this may result in some concerns over the future performances of mentioned markets under uncertainty. It should be noted that aggregator can be a person or an authority who is responsible for a group of energy consumers/resources like electric vehicles (EVs) and seeks to participate in energy markets in order to get to some expected goals that can be economical, technical and etc. Moreover, attitude to risk of a decision-maker can change in different working conditions which needs to be considered through various decision-making criteria. In this paper, robust performance (optimal/stable operation against the worst possible condition of uncertainty) of an EV aggregator against the uncertainty of market price is studied by incorporating robust optimization method. The aggregator willing to participate in energy market can benefit from the provided strategies created by this optimization model to satisfy the expected economic goals and control the uncertainty of energy market. In detail, specific plans and strategies are determined toward possible values of uncertain market price that satisfy economic goals of aggregator and keep the uncertainty under control. Mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) is used to model the problem which is solved in general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software. A microgrid system composed of distributed generation units (local generation units that can be either renewable or non-renewable) including dispatchable and non-dispatchable ones, EVs and storage system is studied, and the results are presented. The results show that robust optimization model can minimize the daily market cost while mitigating possible risks for the aggregator of EVs. It should be noted that daily market accounts for energy market in which various energy resources are available to be selected by the related aggregator in order to supply energy demand.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118076,2019,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118076,9,medium

This activity was organized by the IEEE PES Working Group on Modern Heuristic Optimization (WGMHO), under the IEEE PES Analytic Methods in Power Systems (AMPS) Committee. This competition builds upon other previous competitions focused on the application of optimal power flow (OPF) to tackle schedulling problems of electrical power systems. Unlike the previous competitions, the new test beds consider more factors reflecting the stochasticity associated to renewable power generation, controllable loads, and electric vehicles. Developers of different emerging algorithms were challenged to perform algorithmic improvements and tuning within a limited computing budget. To this aim, the organizers of the competition developed and provided a set of encrypted codes for problem evaluation (i.e. calculation of objective function and constraints and saving of results). The results obtained by the best performing algorithms point out the relevance of modern heuristic optimization to tackle the complexity of stochastic OPF, without resorting to problem simplifications, and within a restricted computing budget. © 2019 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

They have huge effects on the distribution grids planning and operation, particularly on MV and LV distribution grids. Many studies on their impact on the power systems are ongoing, proposing different approaches of managing. The present work deals with a real application case of integration of EVs charging stations with ES-based DG. The final task of the integration is to be able to assure the maximum utilization of the distribution grid to which both are connected, without any upgrading action, and in accordance with Distribution System Operators (DSOs) needs. The application of the proposed approach is related to an existent distribution system, owned by edistribuzione, the leading DSO in Italy. Diverse types of EVs supplying stations, with diverse diffusion scenarios, have been assumed for the case study; various Optimal Power Flow (OPF) models, based on diverse objective functions, reflecting DSO necessities, have been applied and tried.

maybe,,Multi-level virtual prototyping of electromechanical actuation system for more electric aircraft,"Electromechanical actuators (EMAs) are becoming increasingly attractive in the field of more electric aircraft because of their outstanding benefits, which include reduced fuel burn and maintenance cost, enhanced system flexibility, and improved management of fault detection and isolation. However, electromechanical actuation raises specific issues when being used for safety-critical aerospace applications like flight controls: huge reflected inertia to load, jamming-type failure, and increase of backlash with service due to wear and local dissipation of heat losses for thermal balance. This study proposes an incremental approach for virtual prototyping of EMAs. It is driven by a model-based system engineering process in order to enable simulation-aided design. Best practices supported by Bond graph formalism are suggested to develop a model's structure efficiently and to make the model ready for use (or extension) by addressing the above mentioned issues. Physical effects are progressively introduced, and the realism of lumped-parameter models is increased step-by-step. In particular, multi-level component models are architected to ensure continuity between engineering activities. The models are implemented in the AMESim simulation environment, and simulation responses are given to illustrate how they can be used for preliminary sizing, control design, thermal balance verification, and faults to failure analysis. The proposed best practices intend to provide engineers with fast, reusable, and efficient means to assess performance virtually and enhance maturity, performance, and robustness. © 2017 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics",10.1016/j.cja.2017.12.009,2018,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.cja.2017.12.009,9,medium
maybe,,Multi-objective component sizing for a battery-supercapacitor power supply considering the use of a power converter,"Owing to a lack of power density of conventional batteries, the onboard energy storage systems of an electric vehicle has to be oversized to compensate worst-case load condition, which is sub-optimal as it induces a heavy penalty on overall system weight and cost. One solution to overcome this limitation is to hybridize it with supercapacitors in order to boost its power performance via a power converter. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization problem over the parameters of such hybrid energy storage systems, with the aims to solve two conflicting objectives – cost and total stored energy in the hybrid energy storage system, under a set of pre-defined design constraints. An algorithm is first developed to find all feasible solutions to the problem. Two popular design examples are then tested differentiating Lithium Iron Phosphate based batteries from Lithium Manganese Oxide/Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese based batteries. A Pareto frontier is recreated for each example and an ξ-constraint method is finally adopted to choose the best member for comparison. This is so far, according to the authors’ knowledge, the first reported multi-objective optimal sizing method for an active hybrid energy storage system considering the effect of the power converter to gain a clearer understanding of its impact over various design choices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2017.10.051,2018,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2017.10.051,9,medium
maybe,,A novel approach for plug-in electric vehicle planning and electricity load management in presence of a clean disruptive technology,"Plug-in electric vehicles within a decarbonized electricity sector offer a remedy for pollution mitigation in the transportation sector. In this paper, a decomposed planning model for optimal transition to electric vehicle in the deep decarbonization pathway project considering electricity grid constraints is developed. A bi-level charging/discharging control for plug-in electric vehicles is proposed to increase the penetration of electric vehicles in a planning horizon. Moreover, an integrated model of electricity and transportation sectors is developed in to investigate the impact of autonomous electric vehicles as a clean disruptive technology for electric vehicles. The proposed planning model is able to determine whether the existing and future electricity grid infrastructure can meet the growing electrified transportation load in the near future or not. Hence, a Bayesian decision-based conjoint method for developing a heterogeneous transportation demand model is applied. The proposed planning model is carried out on Ontario's grid and a six-bus test system to corroborate the capability of the proposed planning model. According to the obtained results in Ontario's grid, penetration of plug-in electric vehicles is increased to 30% by 2025 while the total CO<inf>2</inf> emission is decreased by 28% compared to the case with no electric vehicle charging/discharging management and disruptive technology. © 2018",10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.085,2018,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.085,9,medium
maybe,,Integration of renewable energy and demand response technologies in interconnected energy systems,"Sustainable island energy systems have been a subject of academic research for some time. Real-life examples of highly renewable and sustainable island energy systems can be found all over the World. Islands on small geographic proximity provide the potential for the development of 100% renewable island energy systems by exploiting their grid interconnections. This paper proposes that interconnections of a group of islands can be used to integrate the production from locally available renewable energy sources. Besides interconnection, electric vehicles were used as a demand response technology to provide storage for electrical energy from variable sources. Electric vehicles were connected to the grid using smart charging systems (vehicle-to-grid). In addition, stationary batteries were explored in sub-scenarios for the year 2035. This enabled to analyse the influence of the battery location through two main different scenarios, i.e. one big central battery and several smaller distributed batteries. Scenarios with different integration dynamic of variable renewable energy sources and electrical vehicles were modelled with EnergyPLAN model, while the interconnection analysis was carried out with the MultiNode tool expansion. The results showed that the interconnections increased the share of energy from renewable energy sources in the final energy consumption and declined the total critical excess electricity production, while vehicle to grid technology enabled exploitation of synergies between sectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.134,2018,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.134,9,medium
maybe,,Effects of electric vehicles on the spot market price,"In this paper we investigate the impact of different electric vehicle charging strategies on spot market power prices for the case of Germany. We also provide a detailed analysis of uncertainties resulting from vehicle-to-grid (V2G), the most flexible charging option. Since the integration of renewable energy sources requires flexibility, we compare V2G with two competing systemic flexibility options provided by highly flexible power plants and resulting from EU high voltage grid expansion, respectively. In all cases we find that V2G has by far the most significant impact on prices, mainly smoothing them, while reducing, for example, the surplus electricity from renewable energy sources. V2G also has the strongest influence on prices compared to the systemic flexibility options of more flexible power plants or network expansion. In addition, we show that it is important to take the structural difference between working days and weekends into account. Especially on weekend days, which are usually characterized by low power demand, V2G raises power prices the most. Finally, the price effects are accompanied by a saturation effect, which is already noticeable in the German case at two million vehicles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.180,2018,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.180,9,medium

Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) are important component for energizing EVs equipped with battery charging mode. In this paper, energy loss reduction and voltage stability factor are enhanced by optimal allocation of Distributed Generation (DG) and BSS, using new Grasshopper Optimizer Algorithm (GOA). The zone based strategy with dispersed DG ensures sufficient distance among BSS's to adequately serve the motorists and enhance system performance. The operational constraints of BSS, DG and loads in each zone for 33-and 69-bus networks are considered. GOA method is compared with established and well-known techniques, namely Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Using GOA, energy losses are reduced to 82% and 92%, while loadability is increased to 13% and 19% in 33- and 69-bus systems, respectively. The results have shown superiority of GOA in terms of system performance and convergence characteristics.

Unfortunately, infrastruc.ture, battery degradation and consumer awareness are only some of the challenges to a faster development of this technology. This paper offers a qualitative comparative analysis that draws on a subsample of 227 semi-structured interviews on electric vehicles with both transportation and electricity experts from 201 institutions and 17 cities within the Nordic region to discuss the reasoning and arguments behind V2G incentives and policy mechanisms. A frequency analysis of the most coded V2G responses favours an update of the electricity market regulation – in particular in relation to electricity taxation and aggregator markets – and support for pilot projects. However, the analysis overall implies that V2G, in contrast to EVs, is a technology for the market and by the market. One that will develop on its own over time. More in-depth, our analysis shows the debates around V2G and how its perspective differs per country, pending available frequency capacity and flexible production (hydro power).

The model introduces power constraints in the grid-to-battery converter to improve modelling accuracy. Simulation results of the presented model indicate EV charging impact on a low-voltage electricity grid. Even though most of the battery charging load is spread evenly during desired times (e.g. off-peak load during night), power constraints of the EV model result in narrow peak loads. Plug-in EVs bring additional load to the electricity grid. If not managed properly, high EV deployment may lead to unnecessary grid investments due to highpeak currents of EV charging. Rising numbers of grid connected EVs is a challenging task in the future electricity grid planning.

For EV aggregations in AS markets, the targeted EV fleet size, which is a function of energy tariff charged by the EV aggregator, is a key planning consideration. In the case of ESS, the physical size is the main planning consideration.

Along with increasing expectations related to power quality from customers, and as new types of loads emerge, such as electric vehicles, local (renewable) energy generation, and stationary and mobile energy storage, it is critical to develop new methods for DSM. In this paper, we first construct a more efficient and reliable communication infrastructure in smart grid based on cognitive radio technology, which is an essential component for enabling DSM. Then, we propose a distributed energy storage planning approach based on game algorithm in DSM, which helps users select the appropriate size of storage units for balancing the cost in the planning period and during its use. Since planning problems may lead to consumer discomfort, we propose a cost function consisting of the billing, generation costs, and discomfort costs to balance users' preferences with the payment. Furthermore, a game theory-based distributed energy management scheme is developed in DSM without leaking user privacy, which is used as inner optimization in our proposed distributed energy storage planning approach. In this energy management scheme, Nash equilibrium is obtained with minimum information exchange using proximal decomposition algorithm.

maybe,,"Demand-Side Management by Regulating Charging and Discharging of the EV, ESS, and Utilizing Renewable Energy","The evolution in microgrid technologies as well as the integration of electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and renewable energy sources will all play a significant role in balancing the planned generation of electricity and its real-time use. We propose a real-time decentralized demand-side management (RDCDSM) to adjust the real-time residential load to follow a preplanned day-ahead energy generation by the microgrid, based on predicted customers' aggregate load. A deviation from the predicted demand at the time of consumption is assumed to result in additional cost or penalty inflicted on the deviated customers. To develop our system, we formulate a game with mixed strategy which in the first phase (i.e., prediction phase) allows each customer to process the day ahead raw predicted demand to reduce the anticipated electricity cost by generating a flattened curve for its forecasted future demand. Then, in the second stage (i.e., allocation phase), customers play another game with mixed strategy to mitigate the deviation between the instantaneous real-time consumption and the day-ahead predicted one. To achieve this, customers exploit renewable energy and ESSs and decide optimal strategies for their charging/discharging, taking into account their operational constraints. RDCDSM will help the microgrid operator to better deal with uncertainties in the system through better planning its day-ahead electricity generation and purchase, thus increasing the quality of power delivery to the customer. We evaluate the performance of our method against a centralized allocation and an existing decentralized EV charge control noncooperative game method both of which rely on a day ahead demand prediction without any refinement.

maybe,,A Monte Carlo Simulation Approach to Evaluate Service Capacities of EV Charging and Battery Swapping Stations,"With the rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) ownership, attentions have been paid to the foundation of EVs, the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Different approaches of effort, among which battery swapping and fast charging are the two most well studied, have been made to solve the tradeoff problem between the battery charging speed and battery lifetime. There has been considerable debate over development strategy between charging and battery swapping. In passenger vehicles, the EV charging mode seems to dominate. But, does it mean that the battery swap mode is a dead-end? The answer should be “No”. There are use cases showing that battery swap can have great potentials for some particular uses, such as taxis and buses. This paper uses Monte Carlo simulations of vehicle behaviors to compare the service capacities and earnings of EV charging and battery swapping for both taxi and bus fleets. Stochastic models of taxis, buses, charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping systems are set up. Subsequently, service capacities of the EVSE are compared. The impact of factors on the service capacity, such as the size of the vehicle's battery, vehicle's moving speed, the power of the CS, and the price of the swapping service is investigated. Finally, possible reasons of today's less prevalence of battery swapping stations are discussed. The results of the analysis, which can be helpful to policymakers and industry investors, show that with same service capacity, an EV battery swapping station could provide significantly more financial and social benefits for the vehicle operators and EVSE service providers than that of an EV CS.",10.1109/TII.2018.2796498,2018,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tii.2018.2796498,9,medium

maybe,,Single-Phase Boost Inverter-Based Electric Vehicle Charger With Integrated Vehicle to Grid Reactive Power Compensation,"Vehicle to grid (V2G) reactive power compensation using electric vehicle (EV) onboard chargers helps to ensure grid power quality by achieving unity power factor operation. However, the use of EVs for V2G reactive power compensation increases the second-order harmonic ripple current component at the DC-side of the charger. For single-phase, single-stage EV chargers, the ripple current component has to be supplied by the EV battery, unless a ripple compensation method is employed. Additionally, continuous usage of EV chargers for reactive power compensation, when the EV battery is not charging from the grid, exposes the EV battery to these undesirable ripple current components for a longer period and discharges the battery due to power conversion losses. This paper presents a way to provide V2G reactive power compensation through a boost inverter-based single stage EV charger and a DC-side capacitor without adversely affecting the EV battery. The operation of the boost inverter-based EV charger with second-order harmonic and switching frequency ripple current reduction, the dynamic behavior of the system, the transition between different operating modes, the DC-side capacitor voltage control above a minimum allowed voltage, and the DC-side capacitor sizing are extensively analyzed.

maybe,,Performance-Based Settlement of Frequency Regulation for Electric Vehicle Aggregators,"Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) aggregators may have an uncertain capacity submission problem due to random behaviors of pertaining EVs. From the market perspective, we investigate whether the market settlement rules are appropriate enough to induce V2G aggregators to submit an accurate capacity rather than an exaggerated over-capacity. We first review the frequency regulation settlement rules of most representative ISOs in North America such as PJM, MISO, CAISO, and NYISO and several European TSOs. Based on the settlement rules, we analyze how the uncertain submission of V2G aggregators affects the settlements in terms of mileage and accuracy, and perform simulations to evaluate the effect of the exaggerated over-capacity submission on mileage, accuracy, and reward.

maybe,,Coordinated Autonomous Vehicle Parking for Vehicle-to-Grid Services: Formulation and Distributed Algorithm,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will revolutionarize ground transport and take a substantial role in the future transportation system. Most AVs are likely to be electric vehicles (EVs) and they can participate in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system to support various V2G services. Although it is generally infeasible for EVs to dictate their routes, we can design AV travel plans to fulfill certain system-wide objectives. In this paper, we focus on the AVs looking for parking and study how they can be led to appropriate parking facilities to support V2G services. We formulate the coordinated parking problem (CPP), which can be solved by a standard integer linear program solver but requires long computational time. To make it more practical, we develop a distributed algorithm to address CPP based on dual decomposition. We carry out a series of simulations to evaluate the proposed solution methods. Our results show that the distributed algorithm can produce nearly optimal solutions with substantially less computational time. A coarser time scale can improve computational time but degrade the solution quality resulting in possible infeasible solution. Even with communication loss, the distributed algorithm can still perform well and converge with only little degradation in speed.",10.1109/TSG.2017.2655299,2018,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2017.2655299,9,medium

This paper explores the operational implications of variable renewable energy and electric vehicle integration at the city scale. A production cost dispatch model is applied to Lusaka, Zambia's capital, whose largely hydro-based electricity system is currently facing shortfalls due to population and economic growth and climate change. The results demonstrate that variable renewable energy penetration and decentralization are important levers for managing greenhouse gas emissions, while the choice of electric vehicle charging policy has significant cost implications. Due to Zambia's flexible hydro assets and potential pumped hydro storage capacity, large penetrations of centralized solar photovoltaic energy can be integrated with low curtailment rates, regardless of electric vehicle charging policy. The high curtailment rates (>10%) and increased greenhouse gas emissions associated with non-export solar PV penetrations greater than 35% can be mitigated with flexible loads, such as electric vehicle charging, that is strategically shifted to coincide with high-resource periods of the day. Without active electric vehicle charging management, large peaking capacity is required to satisfy demand spikes.

We also provide a detailed analysis of uncertainties resulting from vehicle-to-grid (V2G), the most flexible charging option. Since the integration of renewable energy sources requires flexibility, we compare V2G with two competing systemic flexibility options provided by highly flexible power plants and resulting from EU high voltage grid expansion, respectively. In all cases we find that V2G has by far the most significant impact on prices, mainly smoothing them, while reducing, for example, the surplus electricity from renewable energy sources. V2G also has the strongest influence on prices compared to the systemic flexibility options of more flexible power plants or network expansion. In addition, we show that it is important to take the structural difference between working days and weekends into account. Especially on weekend days, which are usually characterized by low power demand, V2G raises power prices the most.

An important emerging challenge is managing their less desirable consequences (e.g. grid instability and peak load), particularly in urban environments. We present a solution that matches the temporal nature of PV generation and EV charging. This solution is a simple coordination strategy for EV charging which minimally affects EV availability for drivers while maximizing the PV electricity generation absorbed by EV batteries. The strategy is benchmarked with high-resolution data from a medium-sized European city. We find that this coordination provides large benefits compared to commonly-observed uncoordinated charging patterns across seasons and PV and EV integration levels. With charging coordination, almost 71%–92% of the EV charging load can be provided by solar panels in the summer. However, winter's lower solar irradiance results in a larger range of possibilities (13%–76%), with the exact value depending on the combination of PV and EV integration level. The gains compared to uncoordinated charging are generally highest in winter and similarly vary based on PV and EV integration levels (from 5 to 63 percentage points).

Quantitatively evaluating the response capability (RC) of EVA, i.e., charging and discharging power ranges, is of fundamental importance for its trading with the operator of power grid. This article proposes a user-aware method to obtain a more accurate range of multitimescale RC considering the response willingness of EV users. First, a temporal RC evaluation model of a single EV considering charge-discharge state and state of charge (SOC) is established. Second, based on the user psychology model, which reflects the relationship between users' responsivity and incentive price, a multitimescale RC evaluation model of EVA considering users' willingness is built. The day-ahead RC of EVA is evaluated by the state prediction data of EVs. According to the control strategy which considers response time and SOC indicators comprehensively, the RC evaluation is updated intraday. Finally, using the statistical data from the EU MERGE project, the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation model is verified, and the impact of incentive price and scheduling time scale on the RC of EVA are analyzed.

maybe,,A Control Approach Integrating Electric Vehicle Charger and Dynamic Response of Demand-Side Resource Aggregators,"Regardless of whether level 1, level 2, or dc fast charging, several methods are under development or available as an aftermarket option for Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). While confining the charging behavior of EVs to low-load periods is difficult, it leads to significant and uncertain load peaks and valleys in the utility power network. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for an electric vehicle charger. The proposed charging method involves power supervisory characteristics on the basis of the paradigm of a constant-current and a constant-voltage (CC-CV) charger so that the external commands from the demand-side resource aggregator in the smart grid can be executed. In the method, first, a feedback loop is included in the controller to formulate the relationship between battery voltage and charging power as a quadratic concave downward polynomial. The controlled output power at the beginning of constant voltage charging is then set to the maximum value of the quadratic polynomial because the charging power requirement near this point is closed to the highest. Hence, if the charging power is lower than the allowable maximum power, the proposed charger is determined to have followed the traditional CC-CV charging steps. On contrast, the proposed circuit launches the power control loop when the actual charging power is beyond the maximum power limitation of aggregator. The proposed charger can keep the power consumption inside an allowable range of aggregator. That is the power consumption at the EV charging sites becomes directly programmable by their aggregators. The proposed method is examined by conducting an interactive test of a remote energy management system and the proposed controller.

The hybrid AC/DC microgrid is a promising alternative for existing power distribution systems to achieve the goal of nearly/net zero energy buildings (nZEBs). However, the increasing demand for compact structure, seamless integration of distributed generators (DGs) and loads, as well as more control flexibility of hybrid microgrids cannot be adequately satisfied by conventional grid architectures. In view of this, an integrated and reconfigurable hybrid AC/DC microgrid architecture with its hierarchical control strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a novel interlinking converter named smart interlinking unit (SIU) is presented, which can provide multiple AC/DC interfaces and diverse operation modes with various control functionalities. Secondly, the SIU-based hybrid microgrid architecture and its hierarchical control structure are established. The dedicated interfaces and cluster controllers for electric vehicles (EVs) facilitate the implementation of centralized vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service.

maybe,,Opportunity mapping for urban scale renewable energy generation,"As part of a project awarded to Glasgow City Council by Innovate UK, a GIS-based Geospatial Opportunity Mapping (GOMap) tool was developed to enable the identification of land throughout the city of Glasgow that is both policy unconstrained and technically feasible in relation to the possible future deployment of Solar Photovoltaic Power Stations (PVPS). To evaluate the suitability of a specific site, two sets of constraints are considered: one addresses the technical aspects that may constrain the economically achievable power capacity; the other addresses the policy aspects that may affect the likelihood of receiving planning permission for an otherwise technically feasible scheme. Overall technical and policy ratings are determined and the outcome displayed on a 10 m × 10 m grid across the city. The output maps allow users to determine the overall suitability of any given site and identify the specific technical or policy aspects that might impede a proposed deployment. Application of GOMap to the city of Glasgow indicated that the potential contribution of deploying PVPS on unconstrained Vacant and Derelict Land is equivalent to the annual heating energy requirement of 21.8% of dwellings in the hard-to-heat category. This finding is significant in relation to the Scottish Government's energy strategy that calls for the electrification of building heating in a manner that alleviates fuel poverty. Alternatively, the generated energy is equivalent to 26.6% of the energy requirement of Glasgow's car fleet if this was converted to electric vehicles.

maybe,,"Electric vehicle charging station locations: Elastic demand, station congestion, and network equilibrium","Battery-only electric vehicles (BEVs) generally offer better air quality through lowered emissions, along with energy savings and security. The issue of long-duration battery charging makes charging-station placement and design key for BEV adoption rates. This work uses genetic algorithms to identify profit-maximizing station placement and design details, with applications that reflect the costs of installing, operating, and maintaining service equipment, including land acquisition. Fast electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are placed across a congested city's network subject to stochastic demand for charging under a user-equilibrium traffic assignment. BEV users’ station choices consider endogenously determined travel times and on-site charging queues. The model allows for congested-travel and congested-station feedback into travelers’ route choices under elastic demand and BEV owners’ station choices, as well as charging price elasticity for BEV charging users. Boston-network results suggest that EVCSs should locate mostly along major highways, which may be a common finding for other metro settings. If 10% of current EV owners seek to charge en route, a user fee of $6 for a 30-min charging session is not enough for station profitability under a 5-year time horizon in this region. However, $10 per BEV charging delivers a 5-year profit of $0.82 million, and 11 cords across 3 stations are enough to accommodate a near-term charging demand in this Boston-area application. Shorter charging sessions, higher fees, and/or allowing for more cords per site also increase profits generally, everything else constant. Power-grid and station upgrades should keep pace with demand, to maximize profits over time, and avoid on-site congestion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.008,2020,"planning,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.008,8,medium
maybe,,Clean energy and transport pathways for islands: A stakeholder analysis using Q method,"Introducing sustainable ways to use energy and transport resources is of paramount importance for creating pathways to more liveable futures. Islands not interconnected to the main grid offer, because of their typically small size, short point-to-point travel distances that suit better than most landscapes the range limitations of today's electromobile eco-systems. This makes them a unique test-bed that may assist researchers, businesses and policy-makers in developing a better understanding of the diverse opportunities and challenges that come with supporting electric-drive vehicle (EV) infrastructure investments that actively prioritise renewable energy sources (RES). This paper reports the findings of a Q method study that looks into the attitudes of 44 key stakeholders that have a thorough theoretical and empirical knowledge of the existing power and mobility portfolios in such islandic landscapes. Our analysis identifies and presents three distinct groups of stakeholders with different priorities and visions: the ‘Tech Enthusiasts’, the ‘Transform Transport First Supporters’ and the ‘Fiscal Focus Executives’. All our respondents agree on the need for radically transforming the current transport-energy nexus offering. They identify the importance of integrated and clean solutions and recognise that support of pilot applications is more critical than research and development (R&D). They also expect technological breakthroughs to increase market maturities and reduce renewable energy production costs and feel that end-users are still hesitant to buy EVs and need incentives to do so. © 2019 The Authors",10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.009,2020,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.009,8,medium

The government is looking to implement a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service for EV use. The present study estimates the economic value of a V2G service, adopting the contingent valuation approach. An online contingent valuation oriented survey of 1007 interviewees was conducted for deriving their willingness-to-accept for the service. The mean willingness-to-accept estimate was achieved as KRW 9821 (USD 8.83) per month, per vehicle; thus, the estimated annual benefit amounted to KRW 117,852 (USD 106.01). The findings can offer a valuable guideline for determining the economic feasibility of a V2G service.

maybe,,Use of demand response for voltage regulation in power distribution systems with flexible resources,"In low-voltage power distribution systems with high penetration of photovoltaics (PVs) generation and electric vehicles (EVs), the over-voltage problem arises at times because of large PV generation, and under-voltage problem also arises sometimes because of simultaneous charging of massive EVs. Over- and under-voltage problems lead to more difficulties in achieving voltage regulation. Demand response (DR) is expected to be promising and cost-effective in promoting smart grids, and hence, the utilisation of flexible resources (FRs) through DR can be helpful for distribution system voltage regulation. This study introduces a hierarchical control structure of a community energy management system (CEMS) and multiple sub-CEMSs to apply an FR-based two-stage voltage regulation technique. In the first stage, i.e. the day-ahead scheduling stage, each sub-CEMS optimises the FRs' schedules for minimising customers' electricity cost and network voltage violation times. In the second stage, i.e. the real-time operation stage, the voltage sensitivity-based FRs' shifting method is proposed to eliminate network voltage violations caused by errors of estimated day-ahead data. The proposed models and methods are verified based on a realistic distribution system in Japan, where voltage violations, customer electricity cost and a number of on-load tap changer tap operations are proved to be reduced.",10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.1170,2020,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.1170,8,medium
maybe,,Novel fast forecasting method for nodal voltage violations,"With the increase penetration of new energy and electric vehicles (EVs), the nodal voltage violations (NVVs) problem is widely concerned. Voltage predictive regulation methods can prevent NVVs and improve the performance of traditional voltage control. A fast and reliable forecasting method for NVVs is a key requirement to support this application. However, it is time-consuming to forecast NVVs using a Monte Carlo simulation-based probabilistic load flow method and the traditional deterministic method based on load forecasting has low reliability due to it not considering the uncertainty of load forecasting errors. A novel fast forecasting method for NVVs with shorter computational time and higher reliability is proposed. In the proposed method, the uncertainty of the load forecasting is taken into account and the impact of active/reactive power change on NVVs can be quantified like the traditional deterministic method. Thus, this method can assist in correcting voltage regulation plans so that voltage constraints can be satisfied as much as possible. Finally, the IEEE 69-bus test system and real historical load series are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",10.1049/iet-gtd.2020.0363,2020,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1049/iet-gtd.2020.0363,8,medium

Based on the statistical data of private car travel, the uncontrolled charging demand of individual electric vehicles and their aggregation are simulated. In the first stage, the electric vehicles and thermal power units are jointly scheduled. To minimize the total cost and standard deviation of the total load curve, the charging and discharging load guiding curve of the electric vehicles and the optimal output plans of the thermal power units in each period of the scheduled day are formulated. In the second stage, the electric vehicle load management and control centre formulates specific charging and discharging plans for the users through rolling optimization to follow the guiding load curve. The cost of vehicle discharge compensation is considered to improve the willingness of users to participate in scheduling and the user satisfaction. To avoid the “dimension disaster” caused by the centralized dispatching of large numbers of electric vehicles, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to divide the vehicles into different groups. Next, each group is scheduled as a unit, and the model is solved by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

These houses usually have home energy management systems (HEMS) to control and schedule every electrical device. Various studies have been conducted on HEMS and optimization algorithms for energy cost and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) reduction. However, none of papers give a sufficient study on the utilization of main grid’s electricity and selling electricity. In this paper, firstly, we propose a new HEMS architecture with RES and ESS where we take utilization of the electricity of the main grid and electricity selling into account. With the proposed HEMS, we build general mathematical formulas for energy cost and PAR during a day. We then optimize these formulas using both the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO). Results clearly show that, with our HEMS system, RES and ESS can help to drop home energy cost significantly to 19.7%, compared with the results of previous works. By increasing charge/discharge rate of ESS, energy cost can be decreased by 4.3% for 0.6 kW and 8.5% for 0.9 kW.

However, the misalignment between the transmitter coil and receiver coil varies randomly as the vehicle moves, reducing the stability of the output power and the system efficiency. Therefore, a guiding approach is imperative to maintain the coil alignment within an acceptable range. In this paper, a vision-based misalignment detection method is proposed to improve the stability of the system output power and the efficiency. First, the relationships among the system efficiency, output power and mutual inductance were derived in theory. Second, the relationship between the mutual inductance and the misalignment was modeled and simulated using ANSYS Maxwell software. Third, image detection of the ground guideline was used to locate the transmitter coil, and thus obtain the accurate misalignments online. Based on the acquired misalignments, the output power can be rapidly and precisely regulated to the desired value. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately acquire the coil misalignments and then rapidly regulate the system output power in comparison with the conventional discrete proportional-integral control algorithm.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2989466,2020,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/access.2020.2989466,8,medium

Home energy management systems (HEMS) have been proposed to increase efficiency, renewable energy capture and reduce costs for the owners. However, renewable energy is intermittent and time dependent. To increase the capture of this source, an integrated control with Electric Vehicle (EVs) is required to store excessive solar energy. Furthermore, coordination with the load profile enables storage for use at a later time or selling the excess energy to the grid. This requires the use of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that can coordinate all these components with the grid. Operation of these controllers need to be validated before actual deployment. In this paper, a standardized communication modeling based on IEC 61850 is developed for a HEMS controller.

In this study, simplified linearized models of a DC network integrated with large EVCSs, which adopts series and parallel connections (SC-EVCS and PC-EVCS, respectively), are established. In this study, the control subsystem of each EVCS is demonstrated to have weak interaction with the filter subsystem and the DC network. Moreover, a method for designing proper parameters to ensure self-stability of the EVCS is proposed.

To achieve resilient, cost-effective and privacy-preserved operation of the shipboard power system, a novel energy management strategy is proposed in this paper. Currently, a master controller is required for energy management. However, such a centralized energy management strategy suffers from numerous disadvantages. Therefore, a modified nested energy management method is proposed to preserve privacy and run the microgrid system in a distributed manner for plug-and-play operation. Furthermore, the system resilience is enhanced against energy deficiency by reserving more in the energy storage system.

To optimise the PEVCS locations for plug-in electric taxis (PETs), this study proposes to utilise the multi-agent system (MAS) and evidential reasoning (ER) approach. First, an MAS simulation framework for PET operation is proposed to dynamically simulate the PETs' daily operation and estimate the charging demands of PETs, where a variety of agents are built to simulate not only the operation related players but also the operational environments. To accelerate the convergence rate and provide better operational strategies for PETs, a multi-step Q(λ) learning is developed to make decisions for PET agents whether to find passengers or to charge under various situations.

maybe,,Optimal scheduled unit commitment considering suitable power of electric vehicle and photovoltaic uncertainty,"In this paper, a method to review the role of renewable energy as an energy producer in scheduling a problem unit commitment is presented. Today, renewable energy sources, due to the lack of environmental pollution, and consequently a very low marginal cost, have been receiving considerable attention in power systems. The correct management of the unit commitment (UC) is a controversial and important issue in the power production unit, which requires suitable scheduled hours to obtain a minimum cost. This study was conducted to investigate the presence of electric vehicles and photovoltaic sources in UC and their impact to reduce production costs and improve load profiles. To achieve the optimum solution, a meta-heuristic Cuckoo search algorithm with high convergence speed is used to solve the UC problem. An IEEE 10-unit test system is employed to investigate the impacts of PEVs and PV on generation scheduling. Since the PV system is associated with uncertainty, in this study, the Uncertainty problem has been modeled using an iterative algorithm randomly with the allocation of density functions that fits the solar radiation. So, the used stochastic Monte Carlo optimization algorithm is capable of handling uncertain outputs of solar power.

However, installation of parking lots (PLs) in order to supply PEVs causes some financial and technical challenges for electric distribution networks. The changes in system reliability, power loss, voltage drop, and costs associated with the installation of PLs are considered as some of the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, optimal placing and sizing of PEV PLs including different levels of charging stations ((CS); slow, medium, and fast) are presented in this paper. Since PLs have the potential to exchange electricity by electric network, they can be taken into account as distributed generations (DGs) and their installation can be considered from the perspective of installation of DGs. An objective function including system reliability, power loss, voltage drop, and PL cost/revenue is proposed for the optimal planning. Results: Genetic algorithm is employed to solve the optimisation problem. Simulation is carried out on a 33-bus radial distribution network. For the planning purposes of PLs, three different levels of CSs (slow, medium, and fast) in PLs are considered. The effect of increasing the penetration of PEVs in PLs is also examined on planning the PLs. The effect of different dispatch times on the selection of different CS levels (slow, medium, and fast) is investigated as well.

While traditional approaches of assigning conventional generation units to maintain system stability can increase operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, or give signals for new investments, utilizing intelligent control of distributed sources might mitigate those negative effects. This can be achieved by controllable charging of domestic electric vehicles. On the other hand, increasing number of public charging stations gives final users the opportunity to fast charge, making their vehicles an additional source of uncertainty rather than a provider of flexibility. This paper brings a full system assessment of combined effect of slow home charging of electric vehicles together with fast charging stations (both with and without integrated energy storage systems), cast as mixed integer linear programming unit commitment model.

To increase the PEV penetration level with minimal negative impact, the dynamical PEV travel behaviors and charging demand need to be better understood. This paper presents a Markov-based analytical approach for modeling PEV travel behaviors and charging demand. The travel behaviors of individual PEVs are expressed mathematically through Monte Carlo simulation considering two essential factors: temporal travel purposes and state of charge (SoC). Markov model and hidden Markov model (HMM) are adopted to explicitly formulate the probabilistic correlation between multiple PEV states and SoC ranges. This modeling approach provides an efficient and generic tool for analyzing PEV travel behaviors and charging demand based on available PEV statistics. The analytical model is further adopted in the impact assessment of two PEV normal charging scheduling strategies for a range of PEV penetration levels in an IEEE 53-bus test network with field data (network parameters and realistic PEV statistics).

The uncertainties concerned include EV development types, growth rate of load and traffic flow, and distributions of load and traffic flow in the smart grid. The existing single-stage planning model cannot fully evaluate the risks brought by all kinds of uncertainties. Given this background, the multistage CF planning problem considering uncertainties is studied in this work. First, several typical uncertainties in future smart grid with a high penetration of EVs are considered to generate development scenarios for multistage planning. Then, the well-established data envelopment analysis is utilized to evaluate the planning schemes while the novel EV expected energy not supplied cost is defined to measure the service ability of CFs.

The motivation behind our work is to offer guidelines for charging service providers to determine proper charging prices and manage electricity to balance the competing objectives of improving profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on power grid in spite of these uncertainties. We propose a new metric to assess the impact on power grid without solving complete power flow equations. To protect service providers from severe financial losses, a safeguard of profit is incorporated in the model. Two algorithms-stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm and greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm)-are applied to derive the pricing and electricity procurement policy.

maybe,,Unit commitment of a power system including battery swap stations under a low-carbon economy,"Battery swap stations (BSSs) are of great importance as an energy supplement for electric vehicles (EVs). The batteries in these stations not only charge instantaneous energy from the grid (G2B) but also discharge stored energy to the grid (B2G). This bidirectional energy consuming scheme provides more flexibility to the grid operation options, and henceforth, may bring in new challenges to the systems as well. In the meanwhile, the carbon trading mechanisms for the low-carbon economy can also have impacts on the generation scheduling of the power system. Therefore, a unit commitment (UC) model of the power system with BSSs in the low-carbon economic background is proposed to coordinate the G2B/B2G process of BSSs. Our model weighted the carbon dioxide emission in the cost function and tightened the constraint set with BSSs limits and the carbon trading mechanism. Case studies on a 10-unit test system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2018 by the authors.

maybe,,FPGA eco unit commitment based Gravitational Search Algorithm integrating plug-in electric vehicles,"Smart grid architecture is one of the difficult constructions in electrical power systems. The main feature is divided into three layers; the first layer is the power system level and operation, the second layer is the sensor and the communication devices, which collect the data, and the third layer is the microprocessor or the machine, which controls the whole operation. This hierarchy is working from the third layer towards first layer and vice versa. This paper introduces an eco unit commitment study, that scheduling both conventional power plants (three IEEE) thermal plants) as a dispatchable distributed generators, with renewable energy resources (wind, solar) as a stochastic distributed generating units; and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), which can be contributed either loads or generators relied on the charging timetable in a trustworthy unit commitment. The target of unit commitment study is to minimize the combined eco costs by integrating more augmented clean and renewable energy resource with the help of field programming gate array (FPGA) layer installation. A meta-heuristic algorithm, such as the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), proves its accuracy and efficiency in reducing the incorporated cost function implicating costs of CO<inf>2</inf> emission by optimally integrating and scheduling stochastic resources and charging and discharging processes of PEVs with conventional resources power plants.

The paper presents an optimal power control and energy management strategy for Plug-In Electric Vehicle (PEV) charging stations using Wind-PV-FC-Battery renewable energy sources.

maybe,,Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of hydrogen fuel production from chlor-alkali processes in the United States,"By-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali processes can help meet the increasing demand for hydrogen fuel in early fuel cell electric vehicle markets (e.g., California) in the U.S. Hydrogen produced from chlor-alkali plants is typically combusted for process heat on site, vented to the atmosphere (i.e., wasted), or sold to the external merchant hydrogen market. Whether it is combusted, vented, or sold as a commodity, relevant information is lacking as to the life-cycle environmental benefits or trade-offs of using by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali plants. A life-cycle analysis framework was employed to evaluate well-to-gate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali processes in comparison with hydrogen from the conventional centralized natural gas steam methane reforming (central SMR) pathway. U.S.-specific, plant-by-plant, and up-to-date chlor-alkali production characteristics were incorporated into the analysis. In addition to the venting and combustion scenarios, to deal with the multi-functionality of the chlor-alkali processes that simultaneously produce chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen, two different co-product allocation strategies were adopted—mass allocation and market value allocation. It was estimated that by-product hydrogen production from chlor-alkali processes creates 1.3–9.8 kg CO2e/kg H2 of life-cycle GHG emissions on average, which is 20–90% less than the conventional central SMR pathway. The results vary with co-product treatment scenarios, regional electric grid characteristics, on-site power generation, product prices, and hydrogen yield. Despite the variations in the results, it was concluded that the life-cycle GHG emission reduction benefits of using by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali processes are robust. With a diverse set of scenario analyses, the study developed a comprehensive and detailed life-cycle GHG emissions inventory of the chlor-alkali by-product hydrogen pathway and quantified sensitivity indices in the context of different assumptions and input parameter values.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.132,2018,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.132,8,medium
maybe,,"Coordinated control of building loads, PVs and ice storage to absorb PEV penetrations","Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are active loads as they increase the distribution network’s demand during charging and can have potential impacts on the network. This study discusses the impact of PEV charging on a distribution feeder serving commercial customers and proposes a mitigation strategy to make PEV penetration transparent to the grid. The proposed strategy relies on coordinated control of major loads in demand responsive commercial buildings, ice storage, along with strategically deployed solar photovoltaic (PV). A real world electrical distribution feeder serving a number of commercial buildings is used for analysis purposes. Rather than looking at individual building’s economic benefits, the proposed approach considers overall technical and economic benefits of the whole distribution network, focusing on enhancing distribution-level load factor and reducing feeder losses. Results indicate that by performing load control in selected commercial buildings, along with utilizing capability of existing ice storage units and strategically deployed PV, the proposed approach can absorb 100% PEV penetration, and result in 13.4% decrease in the peak load; 10.9% improvement in the load factor; and 11.6% reduction in feeder losses. Sensitivity analysis shows that both load control and PV are needed to absorb any PEV penetration above 50% level.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2017.09.009,2018,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2017.09.009,8,medium

Hydrogen fuel produced by renewable sources such as the solar and wind energy can be an alternative fuel to depress the use of fuels based on fossil sources in the transport sector for sustainable clean energy strategy in future. By replacing the primary fuel with hydrogen fuel produced using renewable sources in road transport sector, environmental benefits can be achieved.

Component sizing of the powertrain is determined by the performance specification that is related to mission profiles and power-flow control methods. In order to minimize the effects of mission profiles and power-flow control methods, the linear programming (LP) technique is employed. The LP problem for minimizing the output energy from the engine under different conditions of driving cycles and capacities of the energy storage system (ESS) is solved to eliminate the effect of the power distribution. Through analyzing the effects of different power and energy ratings of the ESS, the optimal values of power and energy capacities of the ESS are determined.

maybe,,Measurement of power loss during electric vehicle charging and discharging,"When charging or discharging electric vehicles, power losses occur in the vehicle and the building systems supplying the vehicle. A new use case for electric vehicles, grid services, has recently begun commercial operation. Vehicles capable of such application, called Grid-Integrated Vehicles, may have use cases with charging and discharging summing up to much more energy transfer than the charging only use case, so measuring and reducing electrical losses is even more important. In this study, the authors experimentally measure and analyze the power losses of a Grid-Integrated Vehicle system, via detailed measurement of the building circuits, power feed components, and of sample electric vehicle components. Under the conditions studied, measured total one-way losses vary from 12% to 36%, so understanding loss factors is important to efficient design and use. Predominant losses occur in the power electronics used for AC-DC conversion. The electronics efficiency is lowest at low power transfer and low state-of-charge, and is lower during discharging than charging. Based on these findings, two engineering design approaches are proposed. First, optimal sizing of charging stations is analyzed. Second, a dispatch algorithm for grid services operating at highest efficiency is developed, showing 7.0% to 9.7% less losses than the simple equal dispatch algorithm. © 2017 The Authors",10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.015,2017,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.015,8,medium
maybe,,"Development of a pricing mechanism for valuing ancillary, transportation and environmental services offered by a power to gas energy system","Power to gas is a novel energy storage concept that can help in providing energy storage and offer sustainable and efficient alternative ways to utilize the surplus electricity generated by the provincial grid of Ontario, Canada. This situation of ‘surplus electricity’ also exists elsewhere as there in increasing intermittent renewable power on various grids. The ability of the power to gas energy hubs to utilize the existing natural gas distribution and storage network (within the province) to distribute and store the electrolytic hydrogen produced is one of its major advantages. In this study an optimization model of a power to gas energy hub having a hydrogen production module capacity of 2 MW has been developed. The goal of the optimization study is to carry out an economic feasibility of the energy hub under existing pricing mechanisms for the three primary services that it provides, namely: 1) Offsetting CO<inf>2</inf> emissions at natural gas end users by providing hydrogen enriched natural gas; 2) Providing demand response when directed by the Independent Electricity System Operator of the province, and 3) Providing pure hydrogen to a fuel cell vehicle refueling station. It is observed that current pricing mechanisms are not valued high enough for the power to gas energy hub to be economically feasible and payback periods longer than the project lifetime (20 years) have been observed. Therefore, through a post-processing economic calculation, the additional monetary incentive required for the energy hub to achieve a NPV equal to zero for shorter project lifetimes of 8, 9 and 10 years have been calculated. The required additional monetary incentives (for the new project lifetimes) have then been split proportionally to the share of the revenues earned by the energy hub while providing each of the three services. Through this, the existing pricing mechanisms have been scaled up and a new pricing mechanism has been developed that highlights the monetary requirements of a power to gas energy hub to be economically feasible. It is seen that the required increase in the pricing of the three different services offered by the energy hub are reasonable and lie within the ranges proposed for them in coming years. © 2017",10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.042,2017,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.042,8,medium

The homes in the microgrid include the essential and/or shiftable household appliances accurately modeled by the SSUEP. These homes are also equipped with the photovoltaic systems, battery energy storages and electric vehicles. The residential microgrid is assumed to be connected to a smart grid such that bi-directional exchange of electric power would be possible. Being aware of the amount of power demand for the appliances and the day-ahead prices of the energy, the consumer provides the required energy from the photovoltaic systems, battery energy storages and electric vehicles (by Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid capabilities). Moreover, using the flexibility of the shiftable loads, the consumer can be involved in the demand response strategies to reduce the costs. This flexibility is a result of delaying or anticipating the start time and the inter-phase delay modeled by the SSUEP.

maybe,,Distribution system planning to accommodate distributed energy resources and PEVs,"With deregulation of the power industry, environmental policy changes, advancements in technology, and the transformation to smart grid, the distribution planning paradigm has gone through significant changes in recent years. Concurrently, with increase in gas prices, driven by a foreseeable fossil fuel depletion in the future, developments in the automotive sector, and environmental concerns, penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing. These changes will continue to drive the distribution planning problem to evolve in the coming years. This paper presents a comprehensive long-term distribution planning framework from the perspective of local distribution companies (LDCs) considering distributed generation (DG), substations, capacitors, and feeders. Apart from considering the usual demand profile, the proposed framework considers uncontrolled and controlled (smart) PEV charging demand, as well as demand response (DR) options. Based on a back-propagation algorithm combined with cost-benefit analysis, a novel approach is proposed to determine the optimal upgrade plan, allocation, and sizing of the selected components in distribution systems, to minimize the total capital and operating cost. A new iterative method is proposed which involves post-processing the plan decisions to guarantee acceptable adequacy levels for each year of the planning horizon. The performance of the proposed framework is examined considering several case studies on the 33-bus and 69-bus test systems. It is noted from the studies that the presence of uncontrolled PEV charging loads results in much higher plan costs as compared to the case without PEVs, impacts the distribution plan significantly, and hence these loads indeed need be considered in the planning process. On the other hand, smart charging of PEVs have a much reduced impact on the plan cost, and helps alleviate some investments which were needed with uncontrolled charging PEVs. Therefore, the LDCs and policy makers need to encourage customers to adapt these options in the long-run. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.epsr.2016.12.016,2017,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2016.12.016,8,medium

The objective is to minimize Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) under multiple constraints including a limited agency budget, accessibility of charging stations in every possible charging request and charging demands during peak hours. Additionally, we address bi-criteria problems to consider user costs as the second objective. A convex parsimonious model that depends on relatively few assumptions and input parameters is proposed and it is shown to be useful for obtaining conceptual insights for high-level planning. In a parametric study using a hypothetical urban network model generated based on realistic parameters, we show that GHG emissions decrease with agency budget, and that the reductions vary depending on multiple factors related to EV market and EV technologies. The optimal solutions found from the bi-criteria problems are shown to be close to the solution minimizing GHG emissions only, meaning that the emission minimizing policy can also minimize user costs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.trc.2017.10.008,2017,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.trc.2017.10.008,8,medium

Highlighted by an abundance of domestic natural gas and greater accessibility of electric drivetrains, alternative fuels are enhancing the financial bottom-line of organizations while improving the environment and public health. Alternative fuels are diverse and include ethanol, biodiesel, electricity, hydrogen, natural gas and propane. Each has a distinct business case that can be applied successfully.

The performance of the proposed framework is examined considering several case studies on the 33-bus and 69-bus test systems. It is noted from the studies that the presence of uncontrolled PEV charging loads results in much higher plan costs as compared to the case without PEVs, impacts the distribution plan significantly, and hence these loads indeed need be considered in the planning process. On the other hand, smart charging of PEVs have a much reduced impact on the plan cost, and helps alleviate some investments which were needed with uncontrolled charging PEVs. Therefore, the LDCs and policy makers need to encourage customers to adapt these options in the long-run.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2016.12.016,2017,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2016.12.016,8,medium
maybe,,Multi-objective stochastic scheduling optimization model for connecting a virtual power plant to wind-photovoltaic-electric vehicles considering uncertainties and demand response,"A stochastic chance-constrained planning method is applied to build a multi-objective optimization model for virtual power plant scheduling. Firstly, the implementation cost of demand response is calculated using the system income difference. Secondly, a wind power plant, photovoltaic power, an electric vehicle group and a conventional power plant are aggregated into a virtual power plant. A stochastic scheduling model is proposed for the virtual power plant, considering uncertainties under three objective functions. Thirdly, a three-stage hybrid intelligent solution algorithm is proposed, featuring the particle swarm optimization algorithm, the entropy weight method and the fuzzy satisfaction theory. Finally, the Yunnan distributed power demonstration project in China is utilized for example analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that when considering uncertainties, the system will reduce the grid connection of the wind power plant and photovoltaic power to decrease the power shortage punishment cost. The average reduction of the system power shortage punishment cost and the operation revenue of virtual power plant are 61.5% and 1.76%, respectively, while the average increase of the system abandoned energy cost is 40.4%. The output of the virtual power plant exhibits a reverse distribution with the confidence degree of the uncertainty variable. The proposed algorithm rapidly calculates a global optimal set. The electric vehicle group could provide spinning reserve to ensure stability of the output of the virtual power plant. Demand response could optimize customers’ power consumption behaviors and improve the grid connection space of the virtual power plant. The electric vehicle group and demand response could achieve a linkage optimization effect between the generation side and demand side, achieving optimal system scheduling objectives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.enconman.2016.09.072,2016,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.enconman.2016.09.072,8,medium

This paper attempts to address three aspects. First, two novel topologies were derived from the original dual-motor-driven system, and the efficiency models of the system components were built, including motor efficiency, planet gear system efficiency and drag loss of the wet clutch. Second, a systematic optimal sizing framework was constructed. The feasible region of the design parameters was divided into a certain number of grid points, and each grid point represented different design results. Then, a dynamic programming algorithm was applied to each grid point to locate the optimal control strategy and obtain the best grid points under different power levels. After that, a bi-level optimization method was applied at these selected grid points to find the optimal design parameters. Last, the simulation results showed that, compared with the original design, the new topology with two clutches can reduce energy loss by 12.4%, and the optimal design results for the original topology can reduce energy loss by 3.36%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.089,2016,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.089,8,medium
maybe,,Incorporating short-term topological variations in optimal energy management of MGs considering ancillary services by electric vehicles,"This study proposes a well-defined energy management system (EMS) intended for smart microgrids (MGs) operational management. The proposed EMS aims at optimal allocation of active elements including electric vehicles (EVs), distributed generations (DGs), and responsive loads (RLs). To avoid the adverse effects of EVs' burden, a price-sensitive priority-based smart charging approach is outlined. As an innovative point, the potential of EVs in providing ancillary services such as reactive power provision is addressed in improving the MG's techno-economical performance. Moreover, the infield automatically controlled switches (ACSs) are accommodated to yield in optimal hourly reconfigurations. This practice would definitely impinge on the scheduling patterns of active elements and enhance the performance of the MG. Furthermore, the effects of reconfigurations and EVs' reactive power processes are explored on the capacity release of DGs, EV reliance, and imported power from the upper grid. The released/unallocated capacities are offered as reserve resources for undertaking the renewables' intermittency and load forecasting uncertainties. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and tackled based on time-varying inertia weight factor particle swam optimization. A medium-voltage MG is put under numerical analysis to assess the performance of the proposed EMS.

Data were available on the usage of charging infrastructure for the entire island of Ireland since the rollout of infrastructure began. This study provides an extensive analysis of this charge event data for public charging infrastructure, including data from fast charging infrastructure, and additionally a limited quantity of household data. For the household data available, it was found that EV users prefer to carry out the majority of their charging at home in the evening during the period of highest demand on the electrical grid indicating that incentivisation may be required to shift charging away from this peak grid demand period. Car park locations were the most popular location for public charging amongst EV users, and fast chargers recorded the highest usage frequencies, indicating that public fast charging infrastructure is most likely to become commercially viable in the short- to medium-term. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.enpol.2015.12.001,2016,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.enpol.2015.12.001,8,medium

Beside cost issues, the detrimental factors that most discourage people from purchasing EVs are their limited range and the rather poor coverage area of the recharging infrastructure. This clearly indicates the need for higher investments in vehicular technologies and infrastructures; however, software services and applications also play a major role in the transition to electric mobility, e.g. to mitigate EV driver anxiety. In this paper we illustrate the recipe proposed by the European Internet of Energy (IoE) project toward interoperable services for large-scale EV mobility scenarios: it consists of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SoA) to collect and integrate data coming from the heterogeneous actors of the EV scenario thanks to a semantic data tier. On top of it, we describe the implementation of an advanced Route Planning service to compute the optimal path towards a destination according to user-defined parameters and goals; differently from other approaches, our tool integrates reservation mechanisms of charging slots, so that a complete planning of the itinerary can be produced.

RPEVs are free from serious battery problems such as large, heavy, and expensive battery packs and long charging time because they get power directly from the road while moving. The power transfer capacity, efficiency, lateral tolerance, electromagnetic field, air-gap, size, weight, and cost of the WPTSs have been improved by virtues of innovative semiconductor switches, better coil designs, roadway construction techniques, and higher operating frequency. Recent advances in WPTSs for RPEVs are summarized in this review paper.

maybe,,Authentication Scheme for Flexible Charging and Discharging of Mobile Vehicles in the V2G Networks,"Navigating security and privacy challenges is one of the crucial requirements in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network. Since electric vehicles (EVs) need to provide their private information to aggregators/servers when charging/discharging at different charging stations, privacy of the vehicle owners can be compromised if the information is misused, traced, or revealed. In a wide V2G network, where vehicles can move outside of their home network to visiting networks, security and privacy become even more challenging due to untrusted entities in the visiting networks. Although some privacy-preserving solutions were proposed in the literature to tackle this problem, they do not protect against well-known security attacks and generate a huge overhead. Therefore, we propose a mutual authentication scheme to preserve privacy of the EV's information from aggregators/servers in the home as well as distributed visiting V2G networks. Our scheme, based on a bilinear pairing technique with an accumulator performing batch verification, yields higher system efficiency, defeats various security attacks, and maintains untraceability, forward privacy, and identity anonymity. A performance analysis shows that our scheme, in comparison with the existing solutions, significantly generates lower communication and computation overheads in the home and centralized V2G networks, and comparable overheads in the distributed visiting V2G networks.",10.1109/TIFS.2016.2532840,2016,"planning,uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tifs.2016.2532840,8,medium
maybe,,A Healer Reinforcement Approach to Self-Healing in Smart Grid by PHEVs Parking Lot Allocation,"Self-healing is one of the essential properties of smart grid. Improving the self-healing capability of the smart grid is referred to as healer reinforcement. In this paper, a new healer reinforcement approach is introduced, contributing PHEVs, through optimal parking lot (PL) placement and sizing, under contingencies, by considering the available control and protective devices. Moreover, the PL placement and sizing problem formulation is extended by considering PHEVs participation as both backup and storage units in the self-healing process. PHEVs contribution as backup units could provide electricity for faulted zone customers. Furthermore, demand variations during the restoration might lead to congestion occurrence in the backup feeder. Hence, the PHEVs contribution as storage units could prevent congestion occurrence and enable execution of the best restoration strategy, through charging in light load and injecting power to the backup feeding path in the peak load of repair time. In addition, the stochastic nature of PHEV owners' behavior is modeled in service restoration and the possibility of reactive power injection by PLs is considered in the service restoration process. The proposed formulation is applied to a standard test system (RBTS-4) to minimize a combined effect of the customer-based (SAIDI) and cost-based (TCR) reliability indices. The simulation is conducted to investigate the effects of physical limitations on candidate locations as well as PHEVs participation as both backup and storage units.

In this paper, a scenario-based comprehensive expansion planning (SCEP) approach for distribution systems is presented to cope with future uncertainties. This approach can not only take into account the initial investment and operation costs but also consider the expected adaptation cost to other future scenarios, and in this way the flexibility of an initial planning scheme can be achieved. Future scenarios are identified in line with three uncertainties, namely the conventional load levels, penetration levels of PEVs and whether or not with successful implementation of a coordinated charging strategy. The charging profile for dump charging mode has been determined straightforwardly, while that for coordinated charging mode is obtained by solving the proposed day-ahead dispatching model (DDM). Furthermore, a priority-based real time dispatching strategy (PRTDS) is proposed to obtain direct charging instructions for PEVs, and thus to demonstrate the rationality of utilizing the charging profile acquired from DDM in distribution system expansion planning (DSEP).

Different types of PEV charging facilities for private PEVs, including public charging spots deployed in public parking lots (PLCSs) and roadside fast-charging stations (FCSs), are substitutes for each other. This paper proposes an integrated planning framework for them in an urban area from the perspective of a social planner. The planning objective is to minimize the social costs of the whole PEV charging system. The proposed framework decouples the planning for different types of charging facilities. The spatial and temporal charging demands for FCSs are generated by a charging demand forecasting method, when the quantities of different types of PLCSs are given. The optimal siting and sizing problem of FCSs is solved by Voronoi diagram together with particle swarm optimization algorithm. By traversing the quantities of different types of PLCSs, the optimal planning results are obtained.

In this paper, a two-stage integrated energy exchange scheduling strategy for multimicrogrid system is presented, which considers EVs as storage devices. Then, several dual variables, which are representative of the marginal cost of proper constraints, are utilized to form an updated price, thereby being a modification on the original electricity price. With this updated price signal, a price-based decentralized scheduling strategy is presented for the microgrid central controller. Simulation results show that the two-stage scheduling strategy reduces the electricity cost and avoids frequent transitions between battery charging/discharging states.

It is here achieved by the mean of a grid commitment over the overall power produced by a collaborative system which here gathers a photovoltaic (PV) plant with an EV fleet. The scope of the present contribution is to investigate the conditions to make the most of such an association, mainly regarding to the management strategies and optimal sizing, taking into account forecast errors on PV production. Design/methodology/approach-To evaluate the collaboration added value, several concerns are aggregated into a primary energy criterion: the commitment compliance, the power spillage, the vehicle charging, the user mobility and the battery aging. Variations of these costs are computed over a range of EV fleet size. Moreover, the influence of the charging strategy is specifically investigated throughout the comparison of three managements: a simple rule of thumb, a perfect knowledge deterministic case and a charging strategy computed by stochastic dynamic programming. The latter is based on an original modeling of the production forecast error. This methodology is carried out to assess the collaboration added value for two operators' points of view: a virtual power plant (VPP) and a balance responsible party (BRP). Findings-From the perspective of a BRP, the added value of PV-EV collaboration for the energy system has been evidenced in any situation even when the charging strategy is very simple. On the other hand, for the case of a VPP operator, the coupling between the optimal sizing and the management strategy is highlighted.

maybe,,Improving Battery Lifetime of Gridable Vehicles and System Reliability in the Smart Grid,"The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) and unpredictable load demands are two major challenges in providing uninterrupted power supply from a smart grid. One way to address these challenges is to use storage devices that can store surplus energy from RESs and discharge the energy back to the grid when needed. Researchers have recently introduced the idea to use electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, which are called “gridable vehicles” (GVs), as storage devices in the smart grid. Using GVs as loads is well accepted, but as sources, they disrupt system reliability if insufficient GVs are available for discharging when needed. An availability planning model is thus required to address this issue. GV owners' concern over battery lifetime reductions is another issue that impedes the required participation rates for GVs in vehicle-to-grid discharge programs. In this paper, we present an intelligent smart grid system model, which mitigates real-time unavailability of GV sources via an availability planning model. We also propose a GV selection model that prevents GV batteries from premature expiry due to their vehicle-to-grid operations.

The public’s role is expected to change from that of passive service abiders to active service providers, as anticipated by visions of prosumers, smart grids, demand side management, virtual power plants, and electric vehicle management. Smart technology and new business models will increase system complexity and the experience of uncertainty and risk for all parties. Actionability of the public’s participation in the opportunities arising from the transformation of energy systems will become a problem. Methods: With a qualitative functionalist method, we analyze the prerequisites of the public’s participation: the capacity of social mechanisms, such as trust, for the solution of social problems. Functional problems affect the continuation of communication, i.e., the possibility of the sustainment of social reality. We isolate three case studies that illustrate concrete effects of trust, distrust, and confidence on three parties, respectively: consumers, investors, and those affected by grid extensions. Results and conclusions: We argue that the social mechanisms of trust and confidence are more vital for consumers, investors, and those affected than previous research has noticed. These mechanisms determine the achievement of sustainability in energy systems by sustaining actionability as a favorable expectation (trust, confidence), or an unfavorable expectation (lack of trust, distrust).

However, the effect of aging, unmeasured noise, and temperature change on LCL-GCCs may result in parameter perturbations between the prediction model and the actual system. A model mismatch may occur, which may lead to violations of constraints, worsen the power quality of the grid current, and even threaten the system stability. This article presents a novel nature-inspired optimization paradigm named moth–flame-optimization (MFO), which applies the spiral logarithmic function to simulate the flight of a moth approaching a flame. The method is designed to efficiently identify and update the model parameters, and the fitness function for the state variables is designed and solved iteratively to minimize mismatches with the model. The advantages of the proposed method are its fast convergence and ability to determine parameters with high accuracy. These advantages effectively prevent the algorithm from converging to local optima. To achieve the harmonic rejection capability, a sliding discrete Fourier transform (SDFT) algorithm is also proposed to predict the harmonic at each sampling interval; thus, the harmonics are considered in the cost function.

To evaluate their charging and discharging performance and achieve energy recovery, a power accumulator battery testing system (PABTS) based DC-microgrid (DC-MG) is proposed. However, during battery testing, frequent charging and discharging current test may endanger the stability of the PABTS DC-MG.

Therefore, this study proposed a coordinated charging scheduling method for EVs in microgrid to shift load demand from peak period to valley period. In the proposed method, the charging mode of EVs was selected based on a charging urgency indicator, which can reflect different charging demand. Then, a coordinated charging scheduling optimization model was established to minimize the overall peak-valley load difference. Various constraints were considered for slow-charging EVs, fast-charging EVs, and microgrid operation. Furthermore, Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) was used to simulate the randomness of EVs. The results have shed light on both the charging modes selection for EV owners and peak shaving and valley filling for microgrid operation. As a result, this model can support more friendly power supply-demand interaction to accommodate the increasing penetration of EVs and the rapid development of flexible microgrid. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2020.118882,2020,"grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2020.118882,7,medium

Accordingly, more and more EV owners tend to make their charging decisions depending on the guidance from navigation systems, which to some extent transforms the EV charging demands into spatially dispatchable resources in the operation of distribution systems. To involve this spatially dispatchable characteristic at the planning stage of distribution systems, and deploy power devices in a cost-effective way, a comprehensive optimization model concerning the joint planning of distributed generators (DGs) and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) is proposed in this paper from the perspective of a social planner. The proposed joint planning model is embedded with the spatial scheduling problem of EV charging demands, and focuses on the optimum of relevant social costs. To relieve the complexity of the optimization model, an exact second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation is utilized to transform the proposed model into the type of mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP), which can be efficiently solved in polynomial time.

By using a simple center-tapped clamp circuit, which consists of two diodes and one capacitor, many limitations in conventional PSFB converters are solved. The proposed center-tapped clamp circuit provides the clamping path and allows the secondary voltage stress to be clamped to the secondary-reflected input voltage. This results in a greatly reduced conduction loss in the secondary full-bridge rectifier (FBR) due to the low-forward-voltage drop of low-voltage-rated diodes, and the resistor-capacitor-diode snubber loss is eliminated. In addition, the circulating current in the primary side is removed without any duty-cycle loss. Furthermore, the turn-off switching loss in the FBR is substantially reduced due to the decreased reverse-recovery current and the reduced reverse voltage. With these advantages, high efficiency can be achieved. Besides, the size of the output inductor is considerably reduced with the aid of clamping voltage, resulting in a high power density with saving the cost. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter, a 3.3-kW prototype was tested. Experimental results show that the proposed converter achieves high efficiency over the entire conditions with high power density.",10.1109/TPEL.2019.2899960,2019,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpel.2019.2899960,7,medium

Two different strategies which consider an integrated grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid charging framework are utilized in this paper for smart charging of PEVs. The objective functions of the two strategies, namely minimization of total daily cost and minimization of peak-to-average ratio, represent an economic and a technical perspective, respectively. The proposed HPM is based on optimally allocating two different charging strategies at different nodes of the distribution system during the planning horizon. The network impacts and the related financial impacts of the proposed HPM are assessed against two conventional planning methods (CPMs) which are developed corresponding to the two charging strategies.

The distributed power sources connected to the distribution wires (often through power inverters) can provide not just active power, but also reactive power support to the grid. Reactive power management is a key aspect that may substantially affect the efficiency and the quality of supply of distribution networks and, as a consequence, the operation of a distribution company (DisCo). This work proposes the integration of an enhanced version of a practical and transparent nodal reactive power pricing scheme into a precise and complete short-term operation model of a DisCo. This model explicitly considers distribution-network-related technical constraints such as dispatchable and intermittent distributed generation units, voltage-sensitive loads, time-varying retail prices, stationary batteries, step voltage regulators, shunt capacitor banks, and demand-related constraints.

As a type of distributed energy resource, electrical vehicles (EVs) are regarded as a promising solution to the problem. In this paper, a transactive real-time EV charging management scheme is proposed for the building energy management system (BEMS) of commercial buildings with PV on-site generation and EV charging services. Instead of direct EV charging control, the proposed EV charging management scheme applies a transactive energy concept-based approach to address real-time EV charging management. With the proposed scheme, the BEMS can schedule its net electricity exchange with the external grid under the uncertainties of PV generation and EV parking and maximize its profit in the realtime operation. Meanwhile, the EV owners need not provide the BEMS with further private information (such as future driving plans) but only their real-time charging requirements and preference setting of the response to the BEMS's pricing signal in the proposed scheme. As such, the BEMS as a charging service provider only requires the minimal necessary information from EV owners. The EV owners' charging requirements, preference setting of the response curves and their required reimbursements for the response are respected by the real-time charging management and their contributions to the demand response are reimbursed by the BEMS.

The planning problem jointly allocates and sizes a set of distributed generators (DGs) along with the EV charging stations to balance the supply with the total demand of regular loads and EV charging. The planning algorithm specifies optimal locations and sizes of the EV charging stations and DG units that minimize two conflicting objectives: 1) deployment and operation costs and 2) associated green house gas emissions, while satisfying the microgrid technical constraints. This is achieved by iteratively solving a multi-objective mixed integer non-linear program. An outer sub-problem determines the locations and sizes of the DG units and charging stations using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Given the allocation and sizing decisions, an inner sub-problem ensures smart, reliable, and eco-friendly operation of the microgrid by solving a non-linear scheduling problem.

Installing a charging point at each parking space is an expensive way to support increasing EV penetration. As an alternative, this paper proposes the novel idea of autonomous robot-like mobile charger, which can move freely to visit different parking spaces to charge vehicles. Mobile charger decouples EV charging requirement from parking requirement. A Markov chain model is developed to describe the mobile charger operation in a parking facility, which is shared by EVs and non-EVs with stochastic arrivals and departures. The model is used to study performance of the charger, in terms of system throughput, charging delay, and blocking probability. Accuracy of the proposed model has been verified through extensive simulations. It is found that the maximum throughput of a mobile charger is dependent only on the effective charging powers, which may be affected by the size of parking facility.

Herein, each distribution company (DISCO) allocates the parking lots to the electrical feeders to minimize the power loss and expected energy not supplied of the system, and consequently minimize the total cost of the planning problem over the given time horizon. In addition, the generation company (GENCO) manages the charging time of PEVs parked in the parking lots to defer the more expensive and pollutant generation units, and as a result maximize its daily profit. In both planning and operation problems, the behavioral model of PEVs' drivers are modeled with respect to the value of incentive and their distance from the parking lots. To achieve the realistic results in the planning problem of each DISCO, several economic and technical factors including yearly inflation and interest rates, hourly and daily variations of the load demand, yearly load growth of the system, and yearly growth rate of PEVs' application are considered. The optimization problems of each DISCO and GENCO are solved applying quantum-inspired simulated annealing algorithm and genetic algorithm, respectively. It is demonstrated that the behavioral model of drivers, their driving patterns, and even the type of PEVs can remarkably affect the outcomes of planning and operation problems.

The main energy concepts include (1) click-and-go photovoltaics (PV) panels for building integration, (2) centralized exhaust air heat pump, (3) thermal energy storage for storing excess PV electricity by using heat pump, and (4) PV electricity sharing within the building cluster for thermal/electrical demand (including electric vehicles load) on a direct-current micro grid. For the coupled PV-heat pump-thermal storage-electric vehicle system, a fitness function based on genetic algorithm is established to optimize the capacity and positions of PV modules at cluster level, with the purpose of maximizing the self-consumed electricity under a non-negative net present value during the economic lifetime. Different techno-economic key performance indicators, including the optimal PV capacity, self-sufficiency, self-consumption and levelized cost of electricity, are analysed under impacts of thermal storage integration, electric vehicle penetration and electricity sharing possibility. Results indicate that the coupled system can effectively improve the district-level PV electricity self-consumption rate to about 77% in the baseline case.

However, there are limited studies on the energy flexibility quantification and enhancement of the sophisticated building energy systems. In this study, a nonlinear component-based model, integrating building integrated photovoltaics and vehicle integrated photovoltaics, was developed for the energy flexibility assessment. A generic methodology with a series of quantifiable energy flexibility indicators (the off-peak renewable-discharging ratio and the off-peak grid-discharging ratio) has been presented to quantify the energy flexibility of the hybrid grid-connected building–vehicle system. Two dynamic advanced grid-responsive energy control strategies have been proposed for the energy flexibility enhancement. Techno-economic feasibility has been discussed regarding different off-peak electricity tariffs and different rated renewable capacities. Moreover, a technical solution is presented to solve the energy congestion contradiction regarding the exploitation of the off-peak grid electricity and the on-site renewable energy through electrical storage systems.

Generation scheduling (GS) in IMGs is affected by the stochastic behavior of electric and heat loads due to outages of production processes or production lines and the uncertainties in solar irradiance and combined heat and power systems. This paper presents a stochastic scenario-based GS framework to consider uncertainties in an IMG coordinated with PEV charging. Although the scenario-based methods are usually very time consuming, this paper shows that their applications in IMGs will not significantly increase the calculation time. The proposed formulation guaranties that occurrence of each condition of uncertainty will not affect the PEV activities. An IMG with 12 factories, photovoltaic generations, and 6 types of electric vehicles with different battery sizes is considered and simulated.

The present paper develops an integrated approach to economically assess initiatives that can transform island power systems into smart ones. Single and multi-action initiatives fostering the deployment of renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESS), demand-side management (DSM), and electric vehicle (EV) are considered. An hourly unit commitment on a weekly basis is proposed to assess the impact of the initiatives on the system operation costs of five prototype island power systems, which have been identified by applying clustering techniques to a set of sixty islands power systems. The different investment costs of the initiatives are accounted for determining their corresponding internal rate of return (IRR) through their lifetime. The economic assessment of single and multi-action initiatives for five prototype islands representing sixty island power systems quantifies which initiatives are most suitable for which type of island power system. The assessment shows that islands of different sizes and features require different initiatives. Larger islands tend to DSM initiatives, whereas smaller islands tend to RES initiatives.

maybe,,Evaluating the benefits of coordinated emerging flexible resources in electricity markets,"Increasing share of variable renewable energy sources (VRESs) with the aim of tackling climate changes impose several techno-economic challenges to power system operation. VRESs reduce the available flexibility by displacing existing flexible units due to their priority in dispatch and simultaneously enhance the need for additional flexibility due to their uncertain nature. In this light, the system is faced with a flexibility gap. One way to cover the created flexibility gap is the incorporation of emerging flexible resources into power systems operation. On this basis, this paper proposes a comprehensive flexible generation portfolio including bulk energy storages (BESs), plug-in electric vehicle parking lots (PEV PLs), and demand response (DR) programs. A stochastic market-based model is proposed to coordinate the interactions among these flexibility providers considering different sets of uncertainty, such as wind power generation and PEV owner's behavior.

maybe,,A comprehensive study of economic unit commitment of power systems integrating various renewable generations and plug-in electric vehicles,"Significant penetration of renewable generations (RGs) and mass roll-out of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will pay a vital role in delivering the low carbon energy future and low emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) that are responsible for the global climate change. However, it is of considerable difficulties to precisely forecast the undispatchable and intermittent wind and solar power generations. The uncoordinated charging of PEVs imposes further challenges on the unit commitment in modern grid operations. In this paper, all these factors are comprehensively investigated for the first time within a novel hybrid unit commitment framework, namely UCsRP, which considers a wide range of scenarios in renewable generations and demand side management of dispatchable PEVs load. UCsRP is however an extremely challenging optimisation problem not only due to the large scale, mixed integer and nonlinearity, but also due to the double uncertainties relating to the renewable generations and PEV charging and discharging. In this paper, a meta-heuristic solving tool is introduced for solving the UCsRP problem. A key to improve the reliability of the unit commitment is to generate a range of scenarios based on multiple distributions of renewable generations under different prediction errors and extreme predicted value conditions. This is achieved by introducing a novel multi-zone sampling method. A comprehensive study considering four different cases of unit commitment problems with various weather and season scenarios using real power system data are conducted and solved, and smart management of charging and discharging of PEVs are incorporated into the problem. Test results confirm the efficacy of the proposed framework and new solving tool for UCsRP problem. The economic effects of various scenarios are comprehensively evaluated and compared based on the average economic cost index, and several important findings are revealed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.050,2017,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.050,7,medium

maybe,,Displacing natural gas with electric vehicles for grid stabilization,"High renewable and variable electricity penetration in power systems requires increased grid stabilization from balancing power plants, namely gas operated. In the future, however, stabilization might be provided by electric vehicles operating under the smart-grid framework. Departing from this, this paper discusses and quantifies to what extent electric vehicles are required to be possible to shut down gas power plants. The analysis is performed using the EnergyPLAN tool, for the case study of the Portuguese power system in 2050. The results suggest that even a small share of the fleet of electric vehicles providing load balancing could lead to important reductions in gas use and energy excess. The gas share in the electricity mix is reduced from 10.2% without electric vehicles providing for stabilization to zero with 30% of the fleet providing it; the energy excess is reduced from 1.5% to zero above 15% of electric vehicles stabilizing the grid. Therefore, to achieve a power system without fossil fuels, electric vehicles capable of supporting the grid should be developed and adopted, as should be promoted the market and regulatory conditions to allow this. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.064,2017,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.064,7,medium

This paper proposes a comprehensive model for the expansion planning of urban electrified transportation networks (ETNs), which determines the best investment strategies for the TN and the power distribution network (PDN) simultaneously, including the sites and sizes of new lanes, charging facilities, distribution lines, and local generators. The steady-state distribution of traffic flow in the TN is characterized by the Nesterov user equilibrium (NUE). The operating condition of the PDN is described by linearized branch power flow equations. To consider the interdependency between the TN and PDN created by the charging behavior of EVs, the power demand of on-road charging facility is assumed to be proportional to the traffic flow it carries.

The coordination becomes more challenging when the EV owners have different charging preferences. To tackle this problem, a hybrid centralized-decentralized charging control scheme is designed in this paper which mainly includes three parts, as follows. On the centralized charging side, an offline optimal scheduling approach is first presented, aiming at minimizing the energy cost while satisfying the charging requirements of EVs. To deal with the system dynamics and uncertainties, a model predictive control-based adaptive scheduling strategy is then developed to determine the near optimal EV charging profiles in real time. On the decentralized charging side, the interactions between EVs and the charging system controller is modeled as a leader-follower noncooperative Stackelberg game in which the system controller acts as the leader and the EVs act as followers. The existence of the equilibrium state and its optimality are proved and analyzed. It is shown that by adopting the proposed decentralized charging algorithm, the communication burden between EVs and the system controller is low and that the charging scheme is robust to poor communication channels.

maybe,,Balanced charging strategies for electric vehicles on power systems,"This paper presents an electric vehicle charging demand management method by modeling the demand dispatch calculation. Despite the demand shift owing to the price signal, the signal is occasionally inaccurate because of the load variability. The electricity rate has features that can shift the electric vehicle charging priorities; the application of the load fluctuation criterion is sufficient for the management plan. We expect that there is a point, wherein, both the electric vehicle users (saving costs) and the system operators (relieving loads) are satisfied with the mutually beneficial arrangements. Our method determines the balanced state in which the loads and costs are considered simultaneously with the proposing criteria. The method allows the discordance between the electrical prices and the system load fluctuations to be managed, while the time-of-use pricing and load deviation indices are accounted for. We focus on the gap corresponding to the load variation and the charging price in a daily scheme. In contrast to the typical valley filling strategies, the aim of this study is to determine and solve the mismatches in the different goals of the costs and loads, if the state is not mutually beneficial. Therefore, to ensure a system operator perspective selectively, we introduce the load weight and ranking method concepts for dispersing the charging loads, lowering the system marginal prices, and investment avoidance because electricity rates cannot describe the load curves accurately. The charging demand calculation is investigated based on the determination of the charging patterns and daily demands using the priority comparison method. The balancing strategy first fills the mutual benefit points with respect to the changing priorities and then, competes to find the balanced points. The significance of the method is that it is based on the unique relationship between two comprehensive competitive strategies. Thus, we determine that valley filling, flat load management, and regulated deviation are insufficient to describe the user and operator behaviors simultaneously.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.025,2017,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.025,7,medium

Energy storage technologies and their power grid applications are, therefore, developing in fast pace. This paper presents the design, development, and testing of a pole-mounted energy storage system (PMESS) based on lithium-ion batteries. The PMESS aims at enhancing the reliability of a local distribution company (LDC) at the residential level. The system provides load curve smoothing and peak shaving services to a pole-top distribution transformer feeding residential customers. An intelligent control algorithm is developed for optimal scheduling of the battery pack. The algorithm employs communication, load forecasting, and optimization software modules. A prototype unit of the PMESS is installed and tested on a Canadian LDC where the results show positive impact on the performance of the distribution transformer.

However, designing an effective and efficient online V2V charging strategy with optimal energy utilization remains an open issue. In this chapter, a price control based semi-distributed online V2V charging strategy is put forward for an energy swapping station. Specifically, through electricity price control, GEVs are stimulated to participate in V2V energy transactions by offering high revenues for the discharging GEVs and low cost for the charging GEVs. The Oligopoly game theory and Lagrange duality optimization techniques are leveraged to solve the formulated optimal V2V charging problems.

maybe,,Light-duty electric vehicles to improve the integrity of the electricity grid through Vehicle-to-Grid technology: Analysis of regional net revenue and emissions savings,"Vehicle to Grid technologies utilize idle EV battery power as a grid storage tool to meet fluctuating electric power demands. Vehicle to Grid systems are promising substitutes for traditional gas turbine generators, which are relatively inefficient and have high emissions impacts. The purpose of this study is to predict the future net revenue and life cycle emissions savings of Vehicle to Grid technologies for use in ancillary (regulation) services on a regional basis in the United States. In this paper, the emissions savings and net revenue calculations are conducted with respect to five different Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Organization regions, after which future EV market penetration rates are predicted using an Agent-Based Model designed to account for various uncertainties, including regulation service payments, regulation signal features, and battery degradation. Finally, the concept of Exploratory Modeling and Analysis is used to estimate the future net revenue and emissions savings of integrating Vehicle to Grid technology into the grid, considering the inherent uncertainties of the system. The results indicate that, for a single vehicle, the net revenue of Vehicle to Grid services is highest for the New York region, which is approximately $42,000 per vehicle on average. However, the PJM region has an approximately $97 million overall net revenue potential, given the 38,200 Vehicle to Grid-service-available electric vehicles estimated to be on the road in the future in the PJM region, which is the highest among the studied regions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.030,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.030,7,medium

The analyses show how role of different conventional units changes with integration of variable and uncertain RES and how introducing a flexible sources on the demand side, in this case EV, impact the traditional provision of spinning/contingency reserve services. In addition, technical constraints of conventional units, such as nuclear, gas or coal, limit the inherit flexibility of the system which results in curtailing clean renewable sources and inefficient operation. Following on that, sensitivity analyses of operational cost and wind curtailment shows which techno-economic constraints impact the flexibility of the high RES systems the most and how integration of more flexible units or decommission of conventional nuclear, coal and gas driven power plants would impact the system's operation. Finally, two different wind generation polices (wind penalization and wind turbines as reserve providers) have been analysed in terms of operational flexibility through different stages of conventional unit's decommission and compared with the same analyses when EV were used as reserve providers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.123,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.123,7,medium

maybe,,"Electric vehicle charging in China's power system: Energy, economic and environmental trade-offs and policy implications","This work investigates different scenarios for electric vehicle (EV) deployment in China and explores the implications thereof with regard to energy portfolio, economics and the environment. Specifically, we investigate how to better deliver the value of EVs by improving designs in the power system and charging strategies, given expected developments by 2030 in both the power system and EV penetration levels. The impact of EV charging is quantified by applying an integrated transportation-power system model on a set of scenarios which represent uncertainties in charging strategies. We find that deploying EVs essentially shifts the use of gasoline to coal-fired power generation in China, thus leading to more coal consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the power system. Economically, EVs outperform gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of average fueling costs. However, the impact of EVs in terms of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions at the national level largely depends on the charging strategy. Specifically, controlled charging results in more CO<inf>2</inf> emissions associated with EVs than uncontrolled charging, as it tends to feed EVs with electricity produced by cheap yet low-efficiency coal power plants located in regions where coal prices are low. Still, compared with uncontrolled charging, controlled charging shows absolute advantages in: (1) mitigating the peak load arising from EV charging; (2) facilitating RES generation; and (3) reducing generation costs and EV charging costs. Hence, in light of this trade-off of controlled charging with the goals of energy security, economic efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, policy interventions in the Chinese power system should opt for controlled charging strategies in order to best realize the benefits of EVs. Accordingly, this paper proposes that increasing the use of cleaner forms of electricity generation, such as RES power and gas power, and establishing energy efficiency and CO<inf>2</inf> emission regulations in power dispatch are critical for China. Lastly, this work illustrates what the optimized charging profiles from the power system perspective look like for different regions. These results can inform Chinese policy makers in creating a better integration of the transportation and the power system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.040,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.040,7,medium
maybe,,Impacts of plug-in electric vehicles in a balancing area,"High contributions of the electricity generation and transportation sectors to criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in an increased interest and shift towards low to non-carbon generation options such as renewable wind and solar, and alternative transportation options including plug-in electric vehicles. Since plug-in electric vehicles transfer the tailpipe emissions to the electric grid, it is important to study the interaction between the two sectors. In this paper, a previously developed spatially and temporally resolved unit commitment model is used to determine the dispatch schedule of resources with and without battery electric vehicles for 2050 in a fictitious balancing area located within the South Coast Air Basin of California. Cases studied include various charging profiles, penetration in light-duty fleet, imports mix, and grid dispatch strategies. Results of the analysis include average cost of electricity production, market clearing price, temporal production of individual generators, and emissions from electricity generation and the transportation sectors. The results show that deploying battery electric vehicles (1) has little impact on the average cost of electricity generation-maximum of $2.5 per MW h for the cases studied with 40% penetration in the light-duty fleet, (2) reduces the overall criteria pollutant emissions except for one case, and (3) results in a smoother load profile, reduces the use of peaking units, and reduces the average emission intensity of the grid through controlled off-peak charging. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.09.063,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.09.063,7,medium

In fact, the path towards car electrification is started worldwide, but the rate of increase of electrically powered cars will depend primarily on charging stations availability. In this respect, utilities that manage/own local grids may be key actors by investing on infrastructures and thus locally creating the conditions for the spreading of electric cars. A techno-economic analysis of the investment of a local utility has been performed taking into account medium- and long term-forecasts of electricity and fuel prices, as well as electric cars market share and economic risk. The study proved that an investment in urban charging station infrastructure in Italy can be profitable even without incentives, with a payback period of 4-5 years. The results of the analysis have been exploited by an Italian utility which owns/manages the local electric grid in two municipalities. The first steps of the plan implementation, which started in 2014, are reported in the paper. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.038,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.038,7,medium
maybe,,ARIMA-based decoupled time series forecasting of electric vehicle charging demand for stochastic power system operation,"Large-scale utilization of electric vehicles (EVs) affects the total electricity demand considerably. Demand forecast is usually designed for the seasonally changing load patterns. However, with the high penetration of EVs, daily charging demand makes traditional forecasting methods less accurate. This paper presents an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method for demand forecasting of conventional electrical load (CEL) and charging demand of EV (CDE) parking lots simultaneously. Our EV charging demand prediction model takes daily driving patterns and distances as an input to determine the expected charging load profiles. The parameters of the ARIMA model are tuned so that the mean square error (MSE) of the forecaster is minimized. We improve the accuracy of ARIMA forecaster by optimizing the integrated and auto-regressive order parameters. Furthermore, due to the different seasonal and daily pattern of CEL and CDE, the proposed decoupled demand forecasting method provides significant improvement in terms of error reduction. The impact of EV charging demand on the accuracy of the proposed load forecaster is also analyzed in two approaches: (1) integrated forecaster for CEL + CDE, and (2) decoupled forecaster that targets CEL and CDE independently. The forecaster outputs are used to formulate a chance-constrained day-ahead scheduling problem. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed forecaster and its influence on the stochastic power system operation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.epsr.2016.06.003,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.epsr.2016.06.003,7,medium
maybe,,Optimal coordination of variable renewable resources and electric vehicles as distributed storage for energy sustainability,"This paper evaluates the coordination between electric vehicle (EV) fleets, as distributed storage devices, and variable renewable sources for mitigating energy imbalances and offering significant potentials for energy sustainability in an electricity infrastructure. The paper investigates the impact of such integrations for enhancing the environmental sustainability, social sustainability, and economic operation of electric power systems. The goal is to keep the energy sector on track for addressing the 2 degree Celsius (2DC) target per Copenhagen climate agreement.11In 2010, governments agreed that there is an urgent need to reduce emissions so that global temperature escalations are limited to below 2 degrees Celsius. The paper identifies strategies for large-scale integration of variable generation resources without compromising the electricity infrastructure security. The power system uncertainties pertaining to hourly load and wind energy forecast errors, and random outages of generation and transmission components are taken into consideration in Monte Carlo scenarios. The stochastic optimization of day-ahead hourly scheduling of electricity is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. The merits of the proposed optimization model are demonstrated by applying four numerical case studies. The conclusion is that the applications of renewable energy resources and the intelligent assimilation of EV fleets (both as a provider and a consumer of energy) offer major potentials for alleviating power system peak demands, minimizing power grid operation costs and hourly wind energy curtailments, and limiting the environmental impacts of fossil fuel-based thermal generating units in the stochastic operation of an electricity infrastructure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.segan.2015.12.001,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.segan.2015.12.001,7,medium
maybe,,Vehicular delay-tolerant networks for smart grid data management using mobile edge computing,"With the widespread popularity and usage of ICT around the world, there is increasing interest in replacing the traditional electric grid by the smart grid in the near future. Many smart devices exist in the smart grid environment. These devices may share their data with one another using the ICT-based infrastructure. The analysis of the data generated from various smart devices in the smart grid environment is one of the most challenging tasks to be performed as it varies with respect to parameters such as size, volume, velocity, and variety. The output of the data analysis needs to be transferred to the end users using various networks and smart appliances. But sometimes networks may become overloaded during such data transmissions to various smart devices. Consequently, significant delays may be incurred, which affect the overall performance of any implemented solution in this environment. We investigate the use of VDTNs as one of the solutions for data dissemination to various devices in the smart grid environment using mobile edge computing. VDTNs use the store-and-carry forward mechanism for message dissemination to various smart devices so that delays can be reduced during overloading and congestion situations in the core networks. As vehicles have high mobility, we propose mobile edge network support assisted by the cloud environment to manage the handoff and the processing of large data sets generated by various smart devices in the smart grid environment. In the proposed architecture, most of the computation for making decisions about charging and discharging is done by mobile devices such as vehicles located at the edge of the network (also called mobile edge computing). The computing and communication aspects are explored to analyze the impact of mobile edge computing on performance metrics such as message transmission delay, response time, and throughput to the end users using vehicles as the mobile nodes. Our empirical results demonstrate an improved performance 10-15 percent increase in throughput, 20 percent decrease in response time, and 10 percent decrease in the delay incurred with our proposed solution compared to existing state-ofthe- art solutions in the literature.",10.1109/MCOM.2016.7588230,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/mcom.2016.7588230,7,medium
maybe,,Residential Demand Response: Dynamic Energy Management and Time-Varying Electricity Pricing,"Demand response programs are currently being proposed as a solution to deal with issues related to peak demand and to improve the operation of the electric power system. In the demand response paradigm, electric utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity consumption. In this paper, a dynamic energy management framework, based on highly resolved energy consumption models, is used to simulate automated residential demand response. The models estimate the residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies consumer energy use behavior, thus providing an accurate estimation of the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all of the controllable appliances, including plug-in electric vehicles, is found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures. Recently, time-varying electricity rate plans have been proposed by electric utilities as an incentive to their customers with the objective of re-shaping the aggregate demand. Large-scale simulations are performed to analyze and quantitatively assess the impact of demand response programs using different electricity price structures. Results show that simple time-varying electricity price structures, coupled with large-scale adoption of automated energy management systems, might create pronounced rebound peaks in the aggregate residential demand. To cope with the rebound peaks created by the synchronization of the individual residential demands, innovative electricity price structures-called Multi-TOU and Multi-CPP-are proposed.",10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2414880,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tpwrs.2015.2414880,7,medium

Existing electricity markets already provide economic incentives to offer flexibility. So-called aggregators in charge of controlling EV charging could take advantage of these incentives. However, random driving behavior and area-specific market rules complicate the market participation of EV aggregators in energy and reserve markets. The goal of this paper is to investigate the design and performance of a system that would enable EV aggregators to participate in wholesale electricity markets. We consider a certain type of market environment, which includes an intraday energy market and pay-as-bid reserve markets that require exact reserve delivery and have long operating intervals.

maybe,,A Hierarchical Framework for Coordinated Charging of Plug-In Electric Vehicles in China,"Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) technology has drawn increasing amounts of attention in the last decade. As the world’s largest automotive market, China has recently made the electrification of transportation central to its national strategic plan. Because of the unique nature of the vertically regulated power industry, China’s massive deployment of PEVs has to face unique challenges that may not be encountered by any other country/region. Therefore, a comprehensive coordinated PEV charging scheme is urgently needed to facilitate the smooth grid integration of PEVs at all levels (e.g., transmission systems, distribution systems, and charging stations). This paper presents detailed mathematical modeling of a novel hierarchical framework for coordinated PEV charging at multiple timescales (i.e., day-ahead and real-time). The proposed three-level (e.g., provincial level, municipal level, and charging station level) PEV charging strategy jointly optimizes system load profile and charging costs while satisfying customer charging requirements. The interrelationships between various levels in terms of energy transaction and information exchange are clearly identified.

Under these circumstances, it is a good idea to construct a novel unit commitment (UC) model. This paper proposes a model that not only takes advantage of various resources on the demand side, such as electric vehicles, demand response, and distributed generation, but also reflects the effects of CET on generation schedule. Then, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is applied to solve the problem. In numerical studies, we analyze the impacts of DSR and CET on the results of UC, respectively.

maybe,,Two-Stage Mechanism for Massive Electric Vehicle Charging Involving Renewable Energy,"Integrating massive electric vehicles (EVs) into the power grid requires charging to be coordinated to reduce energy costs and the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the system. The coordination becomes more challenging when the highly fluctuant renewable energies constitute a significant portion of the power resources. To tackle this problem, a novel two-stage EV charging mechanism is designed in this paper, which mainly includes three parts. At the first stage, based on the prediction of future energy requests and considering the elastic charging property of EVs, an offline optimal energy generation scheduling problem is formulated and solved in a day-ahead manner to determine the energy generation in each time slot the next day. Then, at the second stage, based on the planned energy generation day-ahead, an adaptive real-time charging strategy is developed to determine the charging rate of each vehicle in a dynamic manner. Finally, we develop a charging rate compression (CRC) algorithm, which tremendously reduces the complexity of the problem solving. The fast algorithm supports real-time operations and enables the large-scale small-step scheduling more efficiently. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can help effectively save energy costs and reduce the system PAR. Detailed evaluations on the impact of renewable energy uncertainties show that our proposed approach performs well in enhancing the system fault tolerance against uncertainties and the noises of real-time data. We further extend the mechanism to track a given load profile and handle the scenario where EVs only have several discrete charging rates. As a universal methodology, the proposed scheme is not restricted to any specific data traces and can be easily applied to many other cases as well. © 2016 IEEE.",10.1109/TVT.2016.2523256,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tvt.2016.2523256,7,medium

The procedures and results of tests on the DC semi-fast charging cycle of EVs used for the public transportation in Bogota D.C. are presented. Some tests to the EV charging cycle were applied in steady state in order to evaluate the performance and the power quality of EVs. The fact that the charging system has a total harmonic current distortion (THDi) of 7% and a total harmonic voltage distortion (THDv) that satisfactorily comply with local and international regulations is highlighted. Tests were performed in transient state of the charger and their analysis was done by using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Results in transient state of the beginning of the DC charging cycle of EVs reveal that the harmonics of greater impact are 3°, 4°, and 5°. Finally, based on the analysis of the presented results, a simulation profile of the charging system was designed using the Matlab Sim Power Systems tool. The obtained model shows an error of 2% compared to measurements in steady state.

First, a multi-scenario simulation is used in which a set of valid scenarios is considered for the uncertainties of wind and solar energy sources and load. Then the UC problem for the set of scenarios is decomposed into the optimization of interactive agents by multi-agent technology.

The key issue in this system is recharging the EV batteries before they are exhausted. Thus, charging stations (CSs) should be carefully located to make sure EV users can access a CS within their driving range. Considering geographic information and traffic density, this paper proposes an optimization overture for optimal siting and sizing of a rapid CS (RCS). It aims to minimize the daily total cost (which includes the cost of substation energy loss, traveling cost of EVs to the CS, and investment, variable, and operational costs of the stations simultaneously) while maintaining system constraints. The binary gravitational search algorithm, genetic algorithm, and binary particle swarm optimization algorithm were employed to optimize the daily total cost by finding the best location and sizing of the RCS in a given metropolitan area in Malaysia.

However, smart grid itself should be a part of the solution rather than being a new burden. According to this research, Electric Vehicles (EV) in the form of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) can play their own role for frequency control in an isolated power system. On the other hand, Microgrids mostly use Renewable Energy Systems (RES) in electrical power production that are naturally fluctuating, in a time there are increasing trends to install the controllable loads such as Heat Pumps (HPs) and V2Gs. On the other hand, operating manners and uncertainties in power systems cause the classic controllers to be unable to provide a proper performance over a wide range of operating conditions. In order to overcome such issues, this paper addresses a control scheme approach using Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) technique to enhance the system validity and robustness against uncertainties. The proposed scheme suggests a parallel connection of CDM and PI controllers in which the performance has been compared with only conventional controller showing that the proposed scheme has superior validity. Different operation schemes have been simulated showing the flexibility of V2G utilization in the modern power system.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2016.10.187,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2016.10.187,7,medium
maybe,,Combined Penetration of Wind and Solar Generation with Plug-in Electric Vehicles,"Combining large penetration of wind and solar generation with Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) seems a promising solution for energy cost saving and emissions reduction. PEVs connected to the grid with smart charging strategies can be an effective way to integrate non-dispatchable renewable generation, smoothing the load curve, contributing to the system stability by providing regulation services, and moving unhealthy emissions away from city centers. This paper analyzes the combined penetration of PEVs, and wind and solar generation using a Unit Commitment model for the Spanish power system, providing some insight on how the penetration of these technologies affects relevant variables such as energy and reserve, thermal plants behavior (such as starts-up and shut-downs, technological energy share, generation costs or emissions) and systems costs. Results show that PEV increase total demand, but its optimal charging smooths the net demand (to be supplied by thermal units) and the final electricity prices. In addition, solar generation penetration leads to a larger net demand with more variability but with lower production costs than wind generation penetration, due to their different hourly profiles. Finally neither solar nor wind generation penetrations are totally profitable for the system with the assumptions made, since their investments costs do not compensate the production cost decrement, but grid parity is almost reached for both technologies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2016.12.105,2016,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2016.12.105,7,medium

In this context, traditional centralized control paradigms may suffer in terms of the timeliness of optimization results due to the volume of data to be processed and the delayed asynchronous nature of the data transmission. To address these limits of centralized control, this paper presents a coordinated, distributed algorithm based on distributed, local controllers and a central coordinator for exchanging summarized global state information. The proposed model for exchanging global state information is resistant to fluctuations caused by the inherent interdependence between local controllers, and is robust to delays in information exchange. In addition, the algorithm features iterative refinement of local state estimations that is able to improve local controller ability to operate within network constraints.

The challenge of alleviating additional uncertainty and variability brought by new sources to the system operation is seen as defining both flexibility capacities and flexibility requirements through provision of multiple services. In this context the role of emerging technologies, such as electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage (ES), is recognized through their active participation in providing both energy and reserve service.This paper elaborates on the benefits of active EV participation in multiple system services through various charging strategies. The presented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) unit commitment problem (UC) considers the capability of EV to provide primary, secondary and tertiary reserve as well as energy, however the focus is put on the benefits of EV providing spinning reserve services. The results clearly show benefits of multiple EV role to that of providing energy only.

In this paper, we study the problem of smooth electric power scheduling in power distribution networks.

We formulate a constrained nonlinear programming problem and incorporate the theory of majorization to develop algorithms that can compute smoothness optimal schedules for the deferrable load dominant system. An effective heuristic algorithm is also presented by extending the majorization-based algorithm for the general scenario with both priority loads and deferrable loads.

Indeed, detailed treatment of PEV charging is necessary for efficient allocation of resources. It is envisaged that a coordinator of charging schedules, i.e., a PEV aggregator, could exercise some form of load control according to electricity market prices and network charges. In this context, it is important to consider the effects of uncertainty of key input parameters to optimization algorithms for PEV charging schedules. However, the modeling of the PEV aggregator's exposure to profit volatility has received less attention in detail. Hence, this paper develops a methodology to maximize PEV aggregator profits taking decisions in day-ahead and balancing markets while considering risk aversion. Under uncertain market prices and fleet mobility, the proposed two-stage linear stochastic program finds optimal PEV charging schedules at the vehicle level.

In the DLMP method, the distribution system operator (DSO) calculates dynamic tariffs and publishes them to the aggregators, who make the optimal energy plans for the flexible demands. The DLMP through QP instead of linear programing as studied in previous literatures solves the multiple solution issue of the aggregator optimization which may cause the decentralized congestion management by DLMP to fail. It is proven in this paper, using convex optimization theory, the aggregator's optimization problem through QP is strictly convex and has a unique solution. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the unique solution of the aggregator optimization ensure that the centralized DSO optimization and the decentralized aggregator optimization converge.

An aggregator collects these signals and implements the control with minor computational effort. We evaluate the VOS approach on a scenario for Munich, Germany, based on a mobility survey and real electricity demand and solar generation data.

maybe,,The integration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles into the power system of the Dubrovnik region,"Background: In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, governments seek to replace conventional fuels by renewable ones. Nowadays, most attention is paid to electric vehicles in the transport systems and the use of renewable energy in the power systems. The aim of this work is to achieve a 100 % renewable and sustainable system and to examine the impact of electrification in the transport sector on the power curve and the integration of renewable energy into the power systems of the Dubrovnik region up to 2050. Methods: The analyses of different charging regulation models for the electric vehicles were derived in the EnergyPLAN, which is a computer model for Energy Systems Analysis of the major energy systems and runs on an hourly basis. Calculations were done for selected years—2020, 2030 and 2050. Charging models provided in the EnergyPLAN were dumb charge, flexible demand, smart charge and smart charge with vehicle-to-grid. For each year, two different charging models were selected. Charging regulations according to three tariff models, based on a lower and higher electricity price, with different distributions, were also done for 2050, i.e. tariff model 1, 2 and 3. Results: The results for the year 2020 showed no difference between the models. In 2030, smart charge gained better results than a flexible demand. In 2050, the flexible demand allowed to achieve better results than the smart charge with vehicle-to-grid and the tariff model 1, while tariff model 3 provided the best results for 2050. It is also shown that the energy systems which include electric vehicles have a greater impact on the reduction of a critical excess electricity production than the systems excluding electric vehicles. Conclusions: The power system of the Dubrovnik region was set up as an isolated system, and the electric vehicle batteries are the only storage provided. The results showed that each scenario yielded an excess in electricity produced in the system, which means that the available storage was insufficient and there was a need for more storage capacities in order to achieve a 100 % renewable and sustainable power system. © 2015, Šare et al.",10.1186/s13705-015-0055-7,2015,"uc_ed,grid,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1186/s13705-015-0055-7,7,medium

Typical PEVs are charged single-phase up to 32 A (7.2-kVA) or tri-phase up to 32 A (22.0- kVA). Both charging technologies have to be discussed in order to determine their impact on planning and operating of low-voltage distribution grids to assure a reliable and stable PEV charging. Traditional grid planning and analysis methods, which average and evenly distribute PEV loads on the distribution grid, fail in providing a realistic answer about the grid capacity to charge PEVs. The question; How many PEVs can be charged simultaneously on a distribution grid remains unanswered. Therefore, this paper describes a novel methodology to realistically evaluate the grid capacity for PEV charging on 3-phase 0.4-kV distribution grids. The proposed methodology is a modified Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique, which analyzes grid capacity with respect to charging location, technical distribution grid limitations, and PEV charging techniques.

These factors also lead to an increase in the portion of inverters in the power system. This paper proposes a method to scale up the slack generator size based on parallel inverters. All of the multiple parallel inverters except one share the measured power from the slack bus to the grid by a predetermined ratio based on their sizes. A single inverter that does not participate in power sharing is allocated to be in charge of clearing the small power gap caused by the control delay and the measurement error (i.e., the physical slack). As a result, the net size of the scaled-up slack generator is $n$ times greater than that of the physical slack when $n$ non-slack inverters are added to the physical slack inverter.

An economic emission analysis of the proposed SMOUC problem with the SGTs is carried out to minimize the total expected operation cost and emission using a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method. A two-stage stochastic programming method is used for dealing with the uncertain nature of power generation from the renewable DGs. Lexicographic optimization in combination with hybrid augmented-weighted ε-constraint method are employed to obtain Pareto optimal solutions of the SMOUC problem, and a fuzzy decision making is applied to select the most preferred non-dominated solution.

The proposed charging scheme implements a real-time water-filling algorithm able to reduce the peak demand and to prioritize EV charging based on the data of plugged-in EVs. The algorithm also accommodates utility and local demand response and load control signals for extensive peak shaving. Real-world EV charging data from different types of venues are used to develop and evaluate the smart charging scheme for demand charge reduction at medium & large general service locations. The results show that even at constrained venues such as large retails, monthly demand charges caused by EVs can be reduced by 20%-35% for 30% EV penetration level without depreciating EVs' charging demand.",10.1109/TSG.2016.2647620,2018,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2016.2647620,6,medium
maybe,,"Volt-VAR Control Through Joint Optimization of Capacitor Bank Switching, Renewable Energy, and Home Appliances","Today, the evolution of smart grid, electric vehicles (EVs) with voltage to the grid mode, and deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) are bringing revolutionary changes to the existing electrical grid. Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) is a well-studied problem, for bringing solutions to reduce the losses and demand along the distribution lines. The current VVO, however, does not acknowledge the role of elastic and inelastic loads, EVs, and RESs to reduce the reactive power losses and hence the cost of generation. We propose a mathematical model Volt-VAR and CVR optimization (VVCO)/optimal energy consumption model (OECM) to solve the VVO problem by considering load shifting, EV as the storage and carrier of the energy, and use of RES. The VVCO/OECM not only reduces the reactive load but also flatten the load curve to reduce the uncertainty in the generation and to decrease the cost. The system also considers the efficiency of the electrical equipment to enhance the lifetime of the devices. We develop a non-cooperative game to solve the VVCO/OECM problem. To evaluate the performance, we simulate the VVCO/OECM model and compare with the existing VVO solution. We found that our method took almost a constant time to produce a solution of VVO regardless of the size of the network. The proposed method also outperform the existing VVO solution by reducing the generation cost and flatten the load and minimizes the uncertainty in the power generation. Results have shown that exploiting RES will reduce the voltage drop through reducing the injection of reactive power to the system.",10.1109/TSG.2017.2648509,2018,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2017.2648509,6,medium
maybe,,Performance Evaluation of a Multi-Standard Fast Charging Station for Electric Vehicles,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have been considered as a feasible solution to deal with the high fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions caused by conventional vehicles. However, long charging times and drivers' range anxiety are the main disadvantages of EVs. A key factor that is expected to mitigate these problems and facilitate the wide adoption of EVs will be the effective operation of fast charging stations (FCSs). In this paper, the operation of a FCS is evaluated, in terms of operator's profits and customers' waiting time in the queue. The FCS contains both dc and ac outlets that provide high power levels, while the various EV models are classified by their battery size and the fast charging option they use (dc or ac). The operator's daily profits and the queue waiting time are initially computed by considering that the EVs recharge under a flat-rate pricing policy. In order to avoid a long queue build-up at the FCS, a new pricing policy is then proposed. The intuition behind the scheduled pricing policy is that users are deterred to charge more than an arranged energy threshold, thus reducing the load and the waiting time at the FCS.",10.1109/TSG.2017.2660584,2018,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2017.2660584,6,medium

This paper presents the short-term operation of WCS by capturing the interdependence among the electricity and transportation networks. In the transportation network, the total travel cost consists of the cost associated with the travel time and the cost of utilized electricity along each path. Each EV takes the path that minimizes its total travel cost. In the electricity network, the changes in WCS demand as a result of changes in the traffic flow pattern impacts the price of electricity. The changes in the price of electricity further affect the charging strategy of the EVs and the associated traffic flow pattern. The coordination between electricity and transportation networks would help mitigate congestion in the electricity network by routing the traffic flow in the transportation network. The presented formulation leverages decentralized optimization to address the economic dispatch in the electricity network as well as the traffic assignment in the transportation network.

Communication traffic to charge an electric vehicle should have a higher priority than normal traffic in order to improve the reliability and delay performance. To this end, HomePlug Green PHY, which is a standard PLC defined in ISO/IEC 15118, provides such a priority resolution scheme. However, when there is a hidden station with respect to the high-priority station, the priority resolution scheme does not operate properly, resulting in a higher delay or losses of high-priority traffic. This paper briefly analyzes the priority inversion probability under the hidden station problem and proposes a priority inversion prevention scheme.

maybe,,Planning Fully Renewable Powered Charging Stations on Highways: A Data-Driven Robust Optimization Approach,"This paper proposes a comprehensive two-stage method for siting and sizing stand-alone electric-vehicle charging stations on highway networks. In the first stage, locations, where individual vehicles require charging services, are obtained from Monte Carlo simulation provided with the traffic demand and battery data; an integer programming model is proposed to determine the optimal sites of charging stations from potential candidates, ensuring that every vehicle is able to visit at least one charging station without depleting the battery; afterward, the spatial and temporal distribution of charging demand at individual selected sites can be simulated. In the second stage, a datadriven distributionally robust optimization model is developed to optimize the capacities of renewable generations and energy storage units in each charging station. The uncertain generation and demand are described by a family of inexact distributions around an empirical distribution, and their distance in the sense of Kullback-Leibler divergence is controlled by an adjustable scalar. Two reformulations of the robust model are suggested based on risk theory. The first one relies on Value-at-Risk (VaR) and gives rise to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which is more accurate; the second one offers a conservative approximation based on Conditional VaR and comes down to a linear program, which is more tractable.

The charging station in this research consists of real market PHEVs of different companies with different sizes. The rate of charging of PHEVs is managed via switching control to receive maximum benefits from renewable energy sources and reduce the consumption of electricity from the grid.

An economic emission analysis of the proposed SMOUC problem with the SGTs is carried out to minimize the total expected operation cost and emission using a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method. A two-stage stochastic programming method is used for dealing with the uncertain nature of power generation from the renewable DGs. Lexicographic optimization in combination with hybrid augmented-weighted ε-constraint method are employed to obtain Pareto optimal solutions of the SMOUC problem, and a fuzzy decision making is applied to select the most preferred non-dominated solution. Besides, mathematical modeling of responsive loads can help the independent system operator (ISO) to use a conservative and reliable model to have lower error in load curve characteristic estimation, such as variation in peak load. In this regard, this paper also contributes to the existing body of knowledge by developing linear and nonlinear economic models of price responsive loads for time-based DRPs (TBDRPs), as well as voluntary and mandatory incentive-based DRPs (IBDRPs) based on the customer’s behavior (CB) concept and price ratio (PR) parameter. Also, new mathematical indices are proposed to choose the most conservative and reliable economic model of price responsive loads. Moreover, different widely used DRPs are analyzed and prioritized using the strategy success index (SSI) from the ISO viewpoint to determine the most effective DRP which has more coordination with the SGTs. The proposed MILP-based SMOUC problem with integrated SGTs, is applied to IEEE 10-unit test system and is implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) environment.

Instead, they choose their priority level and energy request amount from the differentiated service menu, and then the CNO directly assigns them to a station on their path. This allows higher priority users to experience lower wait times at stations, and allows the CNO to directly manage demand, exerting a higher level of control that can be used to manage the effect of EV on the grid and control station wait times.

With large scale deployment of EVs in power systems, both the grid and EV owners will benefit if the flexible demand of EV charging is properly managed through the electricity market. When EV charging demand is considerable in a grid, it will impact spot prices in the electricity market and consequently influence the charging scheduling itself. The interaction between the spot prices and the EV demand needs to be considered in the EV charging scheduling, otherwise it will lead to a higher charging cost. A day-ahead EV charging scheduling based on an aggregative game model is proposed in this paper. The impacts of the EV demand on the electricity prices are formulated with the game model in the scheduling considering possible actions of other EVs. The existence and uniqueness of the pure strategy Nash equilibrium are proved for the game. An optimization method is developed to calculate the equilibrium of the game model through quadratic programming.

The huge number of high-rise buildings in big cities and modern technological advances have created conditions to mount on-site wind power generators on the buildings. Since modern buildings are usually equipped with large parking lots for EVs, it shows vital practical significance to utilize the on-site wind power generation to charge EVs parked in the buildings. In this paper, we first use a case study in Beijing to show that the on-site wind power generation of high-rise buildings can potentially support all the EVs in the city. Considering that the charging demand of EVs usually does not align with the uncertain wind power, the coordination of EV charging with the locally generated wind power in a microgrid of buildings is investigated and three main contributions are made. First, we investigate the problem and formulate it as a Markov decision process, which incorporates the random driving requirements of EVs among the buildings. Second, we develop a distributed simulation-based policy improvement (DSBPI) method, which can improve from heuristic and experience-based policies.

The corresponding electric systems are then operated and constrained to meet the load every hour over four years. The total cost of each energy system is calculated, both with and without externalities, to find the least cost energy systems. Using today's costs of conventional and renewable electricity and without adding any externalities, the cost-minimum system includes no renewable generation, but does include EVs. When externalities are included, however, the most cost-effective to system covers 50% of the electric load with renewable energy and runs reliably without need for either new conventional generation or purpose-built storage. The three novel energy policy implications of this research are: (1) using today's cost of renewable electricity and estimates of externalities, it is cost effective to implement 240 GW of renewable electricity to meet 50% of the total electric load; (2) there is limited need to construct new natural gas power plants, especially from a system-wide perspective; and (3) existing coal plants may still be useful to the energy system, and instead of being retired, should be repurposed to occasionally provide generation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.060,2017,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.060,5,low
maybe,,Flexibility of electric vehicles and space heating in net zero energy houses: an optimal control model with thermal dynamics and battery degradation,"With the increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy generation and dynamic electricity pricing schemes, applications for residential demand side management are becoming more appealing. In this work, we present an optimal control model for studying the economic and grid interaction benefits of smart charging of electric vehicles (EV), vehicle-to-grid, and space heating load control for residential houses with on-site photovoltaics (PV). A case study is conducted on 1–10 net zero energy houses with detailed empirical data, resulting in 8–33% yearly electricity cost savings per household with various electric vehicle and space heating system combinations. The self-consumption of PV is also significantly increased. Additional benefits through increasing the number of cooperating households are minor and saturate already at around 3–5 households. Permitting electricity transfer between the houses and EV charging stations at workplaces increases self-sufficiency significantly, but it provides limited economic benefit. The additional cost savings from vehicle-to-grid compared to smart charging are minor due to increased battery degradation, despite a significant self-sufficiency increase. If the optimization is conducted without taking the battery degradation cost into account, the added monetary value of vehicle-to-grid can even be negative due to the unmanaged degradation. Neglecting battery degradation completely leads to overestimation of the vehicle-to-grid cost benefit. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.01.005,2017,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.01.005,5,low
maybe,,The value of electricity and reserve services in low carbon electricity systems,"Decarbonising electricity systems is essential for mitigating climate change. Future systems will likely incorporate higher penetrations of intermittent renewable and inflexible nuclear power. This will significantly impact on system operations, particularly the requirements for flexibility in terms of reserves and the cost of such services. This paper estimates the interrelated changes in wholesale electricity and reserve prices using two novel methods. Firstly, it simulates the short run marginal cost of generation using a unit commitment model with post-processing to achieve realistic prices. It also introduces a new reserve price model, which mimics actual operation by first calculating the day ahead schedules and then letting deviations from schedule drive reserve prices. The UK is used as a case study to compare these models with traditional methods from the literature. The model gives good agreement with and historic prices in 2015. In a 2035 scenario, increased renewables penetration reduces mean electricity prices, and leads to price spikes due to expensive plants being brought online briefly to cope with net load variations. Contrary to views previously held in literature, a renewable intensive scenario does not lead to a higher reserve price than a fossil fuel intensive scenario. Demand response technology is shown to offer sizeable economic benefits when maintaining system balance. More broadly, this framework can be used to evaluate the economics of providing reserve services by aggregating decentralised energy resources such as heat pumps, micro-CHP and electric vehicles. © 2017 The Authors",10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.094,2017,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.094,5,low

In stage 2, a two-layer intra-hour adjustment methodology is proposed to smooth the power exchanges at the point of common coupling by coordinating the virtual energy storage system and the electric vehicles at two different time scales. A Vehicle-to-Building control strategy was developed to dispatch the electric vehicles as a flexible resource.

maybe,,An optimal integrated planning method for supporting growing penetration of electric vehicles in distribution systems,"This paper proposes a multi-year expansion planning method for enabling distribution systems to support growing penetrations of plug-in electric vehicles. As distinct from the existing studies, the temporal characteristics of charging loads and their reliability impacts are especially focused in our work. To achieve this, a novel dual-stage optimization framework is developed. The proposed method considers the capacity reinforcement of distribution systems in conjunction with their operation decisions and coordinates them under the same frame so as to minimize the total system costs for accommodating electric vehicles. The uncertainties associated with renewable energy generation, charging behaviors, and conventional load demand are represented by multiple probabilistic scenarios. To fully reveal the impacts of electric vehicle integration, both uncontrolled and coordinated charging schemes are considered in our analysis. Furthermore, as charging loads bring about extra demand to the grid, the reliability criteria is also taken into account in the proposed model. Using a heuristic algorithm combined with reliability analysis, the optimal solution for the concerned problem can be determined, which involves the best timing, locations, and capacities for installation of distributed generation units and network components. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is examined based on a 38-bus test system and the obtained results verify the performance of the approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.014,2017,"planning,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.014,5,low

This paper responds to this challenge by investigating the interactions among three important control tasks, i.e., charging, on-road power management, and battery degradation mitigation, in PHEVs. Three notable original contributions distinguish our work from existing endeavors. First, a new convex programming (CP)-based cost-optimal control framework is constructed to minimize the daily operational expense of a PHEV, which seamlessly integrates costs of the three tasks. Second, a straightforward but useful sensitivity assessment of the optimization outcome is executed with respect to price changes of battery and energy carriers.

The model aims to schedule the power among the different microgrid units while minimising the operating costs together with the CO(2)emissions produced. A storage device is added where the charge and discharge schedule is calculated according to both objectives. In addition, as a part of the demand side participation strategy, a charging schedule was determined for the electric vehicles (EV) in order to increase the system security and further reduce the costs and emissions. A congestion management approach is also introduced, which eliminates congestions by effective unit scheduling according to congestion signals provided by the distribution system operators. The complete day-ahead time horizon is divided in 96 time steps (each with a 15 min time span), which makes the UC problem more complicated. The studied system includes renewable energy resources, a storage unit, two microturbines, a fuel cell and EVs.

maybe,,A Hybrid Dynamic System Model for Multimodal Transportation Electrification,"In recent years, transportation electrification has emerged as a trend to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. The true success, however, of this trend depends on the successful integration of electric transportation modes into the infrastructure systems that support them. Left unmanaged, plug-in electric vehicles may suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads on the electrical grid. Online electric vehicles have emerged to remediate the need for stationary charging and its effects. While many works have sought to mitigate these effects with advanced control functionality, such as coordinated charging, vehicle-to-grid stabilization, and charging queue management, few works have assessed these impacts as a holistic transportation-electricity nexus. This paper develops a hybrid dynamic system model for transportation electrification. It also includes next generation traffic simulation concepts of multimodality and multiagency. Such a model can be used by electrified transportation fleet operators to not just assess but also improve their operations and control.

Owing to these properties, the SiR-based nonlinear conductive composites have a potential use as the field grading material (FGM) layer in high voltage direct current (HVDC) cable accessories, which is employed to uniform electric field and suppress charge accumulation at the interface between crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) and accessory insulation. In this paper, the space charge transportation and dissipation behaviors of SiC/SiR composites were investigated by pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) test, in view of the effects of SiC filler size and crystal morphology. The results indicated that with the enhancement of nonlinear conductivity, the charge transportation and dissipation processes were accelerated. Compared with α-SiC particles, the β-SiC whiskers could provide a larger nonlinear conductivity. Meanwhile, the trap level distributions of SiC/SiR composites showed that the β-SiC whiskers introduced a shallower trap level at 0.81 eV than the α-SiC particles (0.85 eV). In addition, for the α-SiC particles filled composites, with the increase of the filler size from 0.45 μm to 5.0 μm, the shallow trap density increased, and the deep trap density decreased, resulting in an enhancement of space charge dissipation.",10.1109/TDEI.2017.006388,2017,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tdei.2017.006388,5,low

Design of the powertrain boost converter is challenging because the converter must be rated at high peak power, while efficiency at medium-to-light load is critical for the vehicle system performance. By addressing only some of the loss mechanisms, previously proposed efficiency improvement approaches offer limited improvements in size, cost, and efficiency tradeoffs. This paper shows how all dominant loss mechanisms in automotive powertrain applications can be mitigated using a new boost composite converter approach. In the composite dc-dc architecture, the loss mechanisms associated with indirect power conversion are addressed explicitly, resulting in fundamental efficiency improvements over wide ranges of operating conditions. Several composite converter topologies are presented and compared to state-of-the-art boost converter technologies. It is found that the selected boost composite converter results in a decrease in the total loss by a factor of 2-4 for typical drive cycles.

It is supposed that there exist shallow traps (E <; 1 eV) in dielectric surface. In order to experimentally study how the shallow traps influence the generation of diffuse DBD in air and to explore the mechanism of extraordinary extinguishment in Townsend DBD, thermally stimulated current measurements were performed. It was found the trap level of two types of ceramics was 0.34-0.36 eV, lower than 0.61 eV of quartz, which made it more easily to desorb trapped electrons for the ceramics. There was 280.8 nC of trap charge in GTT ceramics, which was much more than that in common ceramics (38.3 nC) and quartz (15.12 nC). Pulse electroacoustic measurement also indicated that GTT ceramics could acquire more seeds electrons with a longer decay time than the other two dielectrics. Scanning electron microscope observations clearly demonstrated denser distribution and better dispersion of grains in GTT ceramics surface, as was supposed to be the reason why it behaved better than other dielectrics. The results prove that there exist shallow traps in dielectric surface, which could offer seed electrons for generation of diffuse DBD.

maybe,,Placement of EV Charging Stations—Balancing Benefits Among Multiple Entities,"This paper studies the problem of multistage placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations with incremental EV penetration rates. A nested logit model is employed to analyze the charging preference of the individual consumer (EV owner) and predict the aggregated charging demand at the charging stations. The EV charging industry is modeled as an oligopoly where the entire market is dominated by a few charging service providers (oligopolists). At the beginning of each planning stage, an optimal placement policy for each service provider is obtained through analyzing strategic interactions in a Bayesian game. To derive the optimal placement policy, we consider both the transportation network graph and the electric power network graph. A simulation software - the EV Virtual City 1.0 - is developed using Java to investigate the interactions among the consumers (EV owner), the transportation network graph, the electric power network graph, and the charging stations. Through a series of experiments using the geographic and demographic data from the city of the San Pedro District of Los Angeles, CA, USA, we show that the charging station placement is highly consistent with the heatmap of the traffic flow.

High demands including power and energy density, low charge/discharge power stress on the battery (long lifetime), lightweight design, and relatively modest cost at the same time cannot be provided solely by batteries or supercapacitors. For this reason, we propose the use of a Li-ion battery/supercapacitor hybrid embedded power supply for an urban electric vehicle. The sizing process of this system including the optimization of the power sharing is done thanks to a developed hybrid Particle Swarm-Nelder-Mead algorithm involving multi-objective optimization. This approach also allows us to optimize the proposed energy management strategies based on frequency rule-based control and different ways of supercapacitors energy regulation.

maybe,,Integrated power management and aftertreatment system control for hybrid electric vehicles with road grade preview,"This paper presents a model-based and integrated strategy for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) power management and aftertreatment control with preview information of road grade. The HEV power management has been well studied for decades to optimize vehicle fuel economy by properly determining the power split ratio between internal combustion engine and electric motor. Meanwhile, the HEV tailpipe emissions have also been decreased, thanks to the implementation of aftertreatment systems, of which selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems have been widely equipped in ground vehicles powered by diesel engines to reduce NO<inf>x</inf> emissions. For SCR systems, major efforts are dedicated to design the efficient ammonia dosing strategies for removing NO<inf>x</inf> without generating excessive ammonia slip at the tailpipe. By coordinately controlling the HEV power management and aftertreatment systems, it is possible to achieve lower fuel consumption and emissions from tailpipe. In addition, the proposed control strategy incorporates the preview road grade information to calculate the optimal torque–split ratio and ammonia dosing amount such that the overall performance can be improved for the trip. The road grade impacts on vehicle fuel consumption and emissions are investigated in this paper. A model-based controller with an explicit consideration of road grade has been analytically developed and verified in simulation environment.

A grid-connected smart microgrid comprising heterogeneous (active and passive) smart consumers, electric vehicles and a large-scale centralised energy storage is considered in this paper. Efficient energy management by each smart entity is carried out by the proposed Microgrid Energy Management Distributed Optimisation Algorithm (MEM-DOA) installed distributively within the network according to consumer type. Each smart consumer optimises its energy consumption and trading for comfort (demand satisfaction) and profit. The proposed model was observed to yield better consumer satisfaction, higher financial savings, and reduced Peak-to-Average-Ratio (PAR) demand on the utility grid. Other associated benefits of the model include reduced investment on peaker plants, grid reliability and environmental benefits.

maybe,,The value of electricity and reserve services in low carbon electricity systems,"Decarbonising electricity systems is essential for mitigating climate change. Future systems will likely incorporate higher penetrations of intermittent renewable and inflexible nuclear power. This will significantly impact on system operations, particularly the requirements for flexibility in terms of reserves and the cost of such services. This paper estimates the interrelated changes in wholesale electricity and reserve prices using two novel methods. Firstly, it simulates the short run marginal cost of generation using a unit commitment model with post-processing to achieve realistic prices. It also introduces a new reserve price model, which mimics actual operation by first calculating the day ahead schedules and then letting deviations from schedule drive reserve prices. The UK is used as a case study to compare these models with traditional methods from the literature. The model gives good agreement with and historic prices in 2015. In a 2035 scenario, increased renewables penetration reduces mean electricity prices, and leads to price spikes due to expensive plants being brought online briefly to cope with net load variations. Contrary to views previously held in literature, a renewable intensive scenario does not lead to a higher reserve price than a fossil fuel intensive scenario. Demand response technology is shown to offer sizeable economic benefits when maintaining system balance. More broadly, this framework can be used to evaluate the economics of providing reserve services by aggregating decentralised energy resources such as heat pumps, micro-CHP and electric vehicles.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.094,2017,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.094,5,low

The laboratory methodology is explained through tests on a demonstrator of power architecture, specifically designed as simplified case study of a DC charging station for fully-electrified low-power two-wheeler, such as: electric scooters and bikes. This experimental prototype is composed by a 20 kW AC/DC bidirectional grid-tied converter, which realizes the DC conversion stage, and two DC/DC power converters, interconnected with the micro-grid through a DC bus. The power architecture provides on one hand the charging operations of electric two-wheeler battery packs and on the other hand the integration of the micro-grid with an ES buffer, which has the main function of supporting the main grid while an electric vehicle is on charge. The performance of the considered architecture is characterized and analyzed in different operative conditions, through a specific management of the energy fluxes. The laboratory tests evaluate efficiency, charging times and impact on the main grid, with specific reference to the DC charging operations of electric scooters. The obtained experimental results show the advantages of adopting the DC buffer architecture, compared with an AC commercial battery charger, considered as reference in this work.

Due to relatively low solar insolation in Netherlands, it has been determined that the power rating of the PV array can be oversized by 30% with respect to power rating of the converter. Various dynamic EV charging profiles are compared with an aim to minimize the grid dependency and to maximize the usage of solar power to directly charge the EV.

In this study, environmental impacts of various alternative delivery trucks including battery electric, diesel, diesel-electric hybrid, and compressed natural gas trucks are analyzed. A novel life cycle assessment method, an environmentally-extended multi-region input-output analysis, is utilized to calculate energy and carbon footprints throughout the supply chain of alternative delivery trucks. The uncertainties due to fuel consumption or other key parameter variations in real life, data ranges are taken into consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, variations in regional electricity mix greenhouse gas emission are also considered to present a region-specific assessment for each vehicle type. According to the analysis results, although the battery electric delivery trucks have zero tailpipe emission, electric trucks are not expected to have lower environmental impacts compared to other alternatives. On average, the electric trucks have slightly more greenhouse emissions and energy consumption than those of other trucks.

Therefore, the PEVs and the solar parking lots can be applied as the auxiliary sources of active and reactive powers by the local distribution company (DISCO). In this study, in order to achieve realistic results, the economic aspects and technical factors of the system, and also the behavioural model of the PEVs fleet are taken into consideration in the planning problem.

maybe,,Contribution-Based Energy-Trading Mechanism in Microgrids for Future Smart Grid: A Game Theoretic Approach,"This paper designs a contribution-based energy-trading mechanism among microgrids in a competitive market. In each fixed time interval, each microgrid can be an energy provider or a consumer according to their energy generation and local demand. Under the trading mechanism, there is a distributor which gathers the surplus energy from providers and distributes it to the consumers based on the consumers' historical contribution level. To design the trading mechanism, a novel contribution-based energy allocation policy (EAP) is proposed. Each consumer who knows this distribution rule decides the amount of requesting energy in order to maximize its utility, i.e., the quantity of energy it will receive. Finally, the economic benefits of such trading mechanism are studied by analyzing the decision-making procedures of consumers and distributor. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative energy competition game (ECG) among the consumers. The existence and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium (NE) are shown, and the NE solution is given as a closed form. Also, even though there are foolish consumers which do not take the given NE solution, a consumer which takes the NE solution will not lose out on its utility.

By using DR technology, grid withdrawal of DSM (demand side management) devices such as heat pumps, electric vehicles or stationary batteries can be temporally shifted. Yet, the development of an accurate control and market design is still one of the greatest remaining DR challenges.

maybe,,Distributed Smart-Home Decision-Making in a Hierarchical Interactive Smart Grid Architecture,"In this paper, we develop a comprehensive real-time interactive framework for the utility and customers in a smart grid while ensuring grid-stability and quality-of-service (QoS). First, we propose a hierarchical architecture for the utility-customer interaction consisting of sub-components of customer load prediction, renewable generation integration, power-load balancing and demand response (DR). Within this hierarchical architecture, we focus on the problem of real-time scheduling in an abstract grid model consisting of one controller and multiple customer units. A scalable solution to the real-time scheduling problem is proposed by combining solutions to two sub-problems: (1) centralized sequential decision making at the controller to maximize an accumulated reward for the whole micro-grid and (2) distributed auctioning among all customers based on the optimal load profile obtained by solving the first problem to coordinate their interactions. We formulate the centralized sequential decision making at the controller as a hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP). Next, a Vikrey auctioning game is designed to coordinate the actions of the individual smart-homes to actually achieve the optimal solution derived by the controller under realistic gird interaction assumptions. We show that though truthful bidding is a weakly dominant strategy for all smart-homes in the auctioning game, collusive equilibria do exist and can jeopardize the effectiveness and efficiency of the trading opportunity allocation. Analysis on the structure of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution set shows that the Vickrey auctioning game can be made more robust against collusion by customers (anticipating distributed smart-homes) by introducing a positive reserve price. The corresponding auctioning game is then shown to converge to the unique incentive compatible truthful bidding Bayesian Nash equilibrium, without jeopardizing the auctioneer's (microgrid controller's) profit.

maybe,,Distribution Grid Impacts of Smart Electric Vehicle Charging From Different Perspectives,"As a consequence of the developments in electric transportation and the evolution toward smart grids, large-scale deployment of smart charging strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) becomes feasible. This leads to opportunities for different market parties to use the flexibility of EVs for various objectives that may be conflicting and result in a nonoptimal shifting of peak demands for the distribution grids. In this paper, we assess the financial impact of various EV charging strategies on distribution grids. We compare a strategy that minimizes network peak loads (from a network operators perspective) with a strategy to minimize charging costs (from the perspective of a commercial party). In a scenario with a high wind penetration in the system, the electricity prices are, for a significant part, determined by the instantaneous wind production. Therefore, we additionally study the effect of wind energy on electricity prices and, consequently, on the resulting EV load and network impacts. We obtain the network costs by calculating the impacts expressed in the net present value (NPV) of the investments costs and energy losses. We found that, in the case where EVs are basing their charge schedules on electricity prices, the increase in NPV compared with a no EV scenario was found to be 25% higher than in the case where the extra peak load due to EVs was minimized. The large difference in network impacts between the price based and network based charging strategies was only observed in the case with a high wind penetration. The results strongly suggest that the situation where EVs are controlled with a strategy to minimize charging costs that does not take the distribution grids into account may not lead to an optimal situation when the entire electricity delivery system is regarded.",10.1109/TSG.2014.2355494,2015,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2014.2355494,5,low

Fully taking into account the uncertainty and dynamics in wind energy supply and EV charging demand, this stochastic and multistage matching is formulated as a Markov decision process.

maybe,,Customized Certificate Revocation Lists for IEEE 802.11s-Based Smart Grid AMI Networks,"Public-key cryptography (PKC) is widely used in smart grid (SG) communications to reduce the overhead of key management. However, PKC comes with its own problems in terms of certificate management. Specifically, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) need to be maintained and distributed to the smart meters (SMs) in order to ensure security of the communications. The size of CRLs may grow over time and eventually may introduce additional delay, bandwidth, and storage overhead when various applications are run on SG. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for creating customized CRLs with reduced size for IEEE 802.11s-based advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Rather than maintaining a huge-size single CRL that introduces unnecessary search time and storage, the idea is to cluster/group SMs within the AMI network and create CRLs based on these groups. The grouping is mainly done in such a way that they bring together the SMs that will be very likely to communicate so that the CRLs will be kept local to that group. To this end, we propose two novel grouping algorithms. The first algorithm is a bottom-up approach, which is based on the existing routes from the SMs to the gateway. Since the SMs will be sending their data to the gateway through the nodes on the route, this forms a natural grouping. The second approach is a top-down recursive approach, which considers the minimum spanning tree of the network and then divides it into smaller subtrees. Via grouping, the length of the CRL for each SM and the corresponding distribution overhead can be reduced significantly. Simulation results have shown that our approach can maintain a balance between the size of the CRL and the number of signatures generated by CAs while guaranteeing security of the communications.",10.1109/TSG.2015.2390131,2015,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2015.2390131,5,low

maybe,,The effect of plug-in electric vehicles on harmonic analysis of smart grid,"In this paper, the effect of plug-in electric vehicles is studied on the smart distribution system with a standard IEEE 30-bus network. At first, harmonic power flow analysis is performed by Newton-Raphson method and by considering distorted substation voltage. Afterward, proper sizes of capacitors is selected by cuckoo optimization algorithm to reduce the power losses and cost and by imposing acceptable limit for total harmonic distortion and RMS voltages. It is proposed that the impact of generated current harmonics by electric vehicle battery chargers should be factored into overall load control strategies of smart appliances. This study is generalized to the different hours of a day by using daily load curve, and then optimum time for charging of electric vehicles batteries in the parking lots are determined by cuckoo optimization algorithm. The results show that injecting harmonic currents of plug-in electric vehicles causes a drop in the voltage profile and increases power loss.

maybe,,Distributed generation incorporated with the thermal generation for optimum operation of a smart grid considering forecast error,"This paper concentrates on the optimal operation of the conventional thermal generators with distributed generations for a smart grid considering forecast error. The distributed generations are considered as wind generators, photovoltaic generators, battery energy storage systems in the supply side and a large number of smart houses in the demand side. A smart house consists of the electric vehicle, heat pump, photovoltaic generator and solar collector. The electric vehicle and heat pump are considered as the controllable loads which can compensate the power for the forecast error of renewable energy sources. As a result, power generation cost of the smart grid can reduce through coordinated with distributed generations and thermal units scheduling process. The electric vehicles of the smart house are considered as the spinning reserve in the scheduling process which lead to lessen the additional operation of thermal units. Finally, obtained results of the proposed system have been compared with the conventional method. The conventional method does not consider the electric vehicle in the smart houses. The acquired results demonstrate that total power generation cost of the smart grid has been reduced by the proposed method considering forecast error. Effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by the extensive simulation results using MATLAB® software.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.02.087,2015,"uc_ed,ev",planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.02.087,5,low
maybe,,Double layer home energy supervision strategies based on demand response and plug-in electric vehicle control for flattening power load curves in a smart grid,"The supervision of energy consumption applied to a smart home, seems to be one of the main challenges for the future smart grid. The purpose of this study was to investigate a double layer supervision strategy in order to ensure a flattened power load curve in a residential application. This control is mainly divided into two levels. The first consists of a demand response algorithm, which plays an important role in scheduling the operation of home appliances by moving the shiftable appliances from peak hours, when electricity prices are high, to off-peak hours when prices are low and thus contributes to improving the daily load profile. The first strategy was coupled with the emergence of Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV), which is a new electrical load that must be considered in a smart home. The second consists of a PEV power management, which aims to ensure the bi-directional power flow from the smart home to PEVs (H2V) and from the Vehicle to Home (V2H). This procedure results in monitoring the power of each PEV connected to the home to determine its power reference and thereby, enhance again the power load curve. Simulation results highlight the performance of the two-layer home energy supervision strategy to achieve the smoothness for the daily power demand curve. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.187,2019,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.187,4,low

It includes a topology and compound controllers. The topology guarantees that the ultracapacitor current and the battery current can be controlled individually. In addition, the control of the hybrid power source is linked with the control of the electric drive system directly. Compound controllers include an active disturbance rejection controller, two current controllers and two operational modes switch controllers. Active disturbance rejection controller is applied in the control of the ultracapacitor in a load-following mode. Current controllers are applied to control the battery current and the charge current of the ultracapacitor. Event trigger based operational modes switch controllers coordinate the active disturbance rejection controller and the current controllers. The advantages of the proposed compound control are that ultracapacitor supplies peak and ripple current while battery supplies smooth and steady current; the control of the hybrid power source is linked with the control of the electric drive system; the high power discharge ability of ultracapacitor is used to reject disturbance.

However, open channels can be vulnerable to various attacks by a malicious adversary. Therefore, secure mutual authentication for V2G has become essential, and numerous related protocols have been proposed. In 2018, Shen et al. proposed a privacy-preserving and lightweight key agreement protocol for V2G in SIoT to ensure security. However, we demonstrate that their protocol does not withstand impersonation, privileged-insider, and offline password guessing attacks, and it does not also guarantee secure mutual authentication, session key security, and perfect forward secrecy. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic privacy-preserving and lightweight key agreement protocol for V2G in SIoT to resolve the security weaknesses of Shen et al.'s protocol. The proposed protocol resists several attacks including impersonation, offline password guessing, man-in-the-middle, replay, and trace attacks, ensures anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, session key security, and secure mutual authentication. We evaluate the security of the proposed protocol using formal security analysis under the broadly-accepted real-or-random (ROR) model, secure mutual authentication proof using the widely-accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, informal (non-mathematical) security analysis, and also the formal security verification using the broadly-accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool. We then compare computation costs, and security and functionality features of the proposed protocol with related protocols.

The demand for EV charging resources has significantly reshaped the net demand profile of power distribution systems. This paper proposes an online optimal charging strategy for multiple EV charging stations in distribution systems with power flow and bus voltage constraints satisfied. First, we formulate the online optimal charging problem as an optimal power flow problem that minimizes the total system energy cost based on short-term predictive models and operates in a time-receding manner with the latest system information. Then, the problem is convexified by a modified convex relaxation technique based on the bus injection model, so that the globally optimal solution can be obtained with high efficiency. Moreover, a distributed model predictive control based scheme is designed to solve the optimization problem per concerns regarding data privacy, individual economic interests, and EV uncertainties. The obtained optimal schedules are dispatched to the EVs parked at each charging station according to a fuzzy rule, which guarantees full charging at the departure time for each vehicle.

Multilevel ZSI uses more number of high-power passive components in the intermediate network, which increase the system size and weight. Also, its input current is discontinuous in nature which is not desirable in some of the applications like fuel cell, UPS systems, hybrid electric vehicle, etc. In this paper, a continuous current input three-level LC-switching-based voltage boost neutral-point-clamped inverter is proposed, which uses comparatively less number of high-power passive components at the same time retains all the advantages of multilevel QZSI/ZSI. It is able to boost the input dc voltage and give required three-level ac output voltage in a single stage. Steady-state analysis of the proposed inverter is discussed to formulate the relationship between the input dc voltage and three-level ac output voltage.

maybe,,A Fast Distributed Algorithm for Large-Scale Demand Response Aggregation,"A major challenge to implementing residential demand response is that of aligning the objectives of many households, each of which aims to minimize its payments and maximize its comfort level, while balancing this with the objectives of an aggregator that aims to minimize the cost of electricity purchased in a pooled wholesale market. This paper presents a fast distributed algorithm for aggregating a large number of households with a mixture of discrete and continuous energy levels. A distinctive feature of the method in this paper is that the non-convex demand response (DR) problem is decomposed in terms of households as opposed to devices, which allows incorporating more intricate couplings between energy storage devices, appliances, and distributed energy resources. The proposed method is a fast distributed algorithm applied to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted DR model. The method is tested on systems with up to 2560 households, each with 10 devices on average. The proposed algorithm is designed to terminate in 60 iterations irrespective of system size, which can be ideal for an on-line version of this problem. Moreover, numerical results show that with minimal parameter tuning, the algorithm exhibits a very similar convergence behavior throughout the studied systems and converges to near-optimal solutions, which corroborates its scalability.",10.1109/TSG.2016.2536740,2016,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2016.2536740,2,low
maybe,,Stackelberg-Game-Based Demand Response for At-Home Electric Vehicle Charging,"Consumer electricity consumption can be controlled through electricity prices, which is called demand response. Under demand response, retailers determine their electricity prices, and customers respond accordingly with their electricity consumption levels. In particular, the demands of customers who own electric vehicles (EVs) are elastic with respect to price. The interaction between retailers and customers can be seen as a game because both attempt to maximize their own payoffs. This study models an at-home EV charging scenario as a Stackelberg game and proves that this game reaches an equilibrium point at which the EV charging requirements are satisfied, and retailer profits are maximized when customers use our proposed utility function. The equilibrium of our game can vary according to the weighting factor for the utility function of each customer, resulting in various strategic choices. Our numerical results confirm that the equilibrium of the proposed game lies somewhere between the minimum-generation-cost solution and the result of the equal-charging scheme.",10.1109/TVT.2015.2440471,2016,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tvt.2015.2440471,2,low
maybe,,Estimating the grid payments necessary to compensate additional costs to prospective electric vehicle owners who provide vehicle-to-grid ancillary services,"The provision of ancillary services in the smart grid by electric vehicles is attractive to grid operators. Vehicles must be aggregated to meet the minimum power requirements of providing ancillary services to the grid. Likely aggregator revenues are insufficient to cover the additional battery degradation costs which would be borne by an existing electric vehicle owner. Moreover, aggregator revenues are insufficient to make electric vehicles competitive with conventional vehicles and encourage uptake by prospective consumers. Net annual costs and hourly compensation payments to electric vehicle owners were most sensitive to battery cost. The fleet provided firm fast reserve from 1900 h for 0.42 h, up to 2.7 h in the best cases. At best, likely aggregator revenue was 20 times less than the compensation required, up to 27,500 times at worst. The electric vehicle fleet may not be large enough to meet the firm fast reserve power and duration requirements until 2020. However, it may not be until 2030 that enough vehicles have been sold to provide this service cost-effectively. Even then, many more electric vehicles will be needed to meet the power level and duration requirements, both more often and for longer to enable participation in an all-day, everyday ancillary services market.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.029,2016,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.029,2,low
maybe,,"Electric vehicle cost, emissions, and water footprint in the United States: Development of a regional optimization model","The life cycle cost and environmental impacts of electric vehicles are very uncertain, but extremely important for making policy decisions. This study presents a new model, called the Electric Vehicles Regional Optimizer, to model this uncertainty and predict the optimal combination of drivetrains in different U.S. regions for the year 2030. First, the life cycle cost and life cycle environmental emissions of internal combustion engine vehicles, gasoline hybrid electric vehicles, and three different Electric Vehicle types (gasoline plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, gasoline extended range electric vehicle, and all-electric vehicle) are evaluated considering their inherent uncertainties. Then, the environmental damage costs and the water footprint of the studied drivetrains are estimated. Additionally, using an Exploratory Modeling and Analysis method, the uncertainties in the life cycle cost, environmental damage cost, and water footprint of studied vehicle types are modeled for different U.S. electricity grid regions. Finally, an optimization model is coupled with Exploratory Modeling and Analysis to find the ideal combination of different vehicle types in each U.S. region for the year 2030. The findings of this research will help policy makers and transportation planners to prepare our nation's transportation system for the influx of electric vehicles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.energy.2015.05.152,2015,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1016/j.energy.2015.05.152,2,low
maybe,,Advanced Power-Source Integration in Hybrid Electric Vehicles: Multicriteria Optimization Approach,"System integration and power-flow control of on-board power sources are critical to the performance and cost competitiveness of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The existing methods mostly focus on fuel minimization in hybrid powertrains, while disregarding many other concerns. This article presents an innovative multicriteria optimization approach and showcases its validity and usefulness in a case study of a fuel-cell hybrid bus. Three key technical contributions are made. First, a convex multicriteria optimization framework is devised for quickly and efficiently evaluating the optimal tradeoffs between the fuel-cell durability and hydrogen economy in the bus, as well as the corresponding fuel-cell dimension. Second, the impact of driving pattern on both the optimal fuel-cell size and Pareto optimality is investigated by considering discrepant driving schedules. Finally, a preliminary but useful economic assessment in both current and future scenarios is performed to explore the most cost-effective tradeoff. © 2015 IEEE.",10.1109/TIE.2015.2463770,2015,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tie.2015.2463770,2,low
maybe,,A Promoted Design for Primary Coil in Roadway-Powered System,"As technology advances, electric vehicle (EV) dynamic charging utilizing wireless power transfer (WPT) becomes prevalent. This new power supply mode allows running cars to be charged with electricity at any time on the road. Unlike traditional tramcars, the EVs can be free from rail limitation, and WPT technology provides maximal charging flexibility. This paper studies a WPT charging system, which uses a series of sectional primary coils. The relationship between primary coil size and transfer efficiency is fully explored. On the basis of sectional wireless power supply, the lateral movement of transfer coils is reported, and a promoted design for the primary coil that provides power for a two-lane road simultaneously is proposed.",10.1109/TMAG.2015.2440481,2015,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tmag.2015.2440481,2,low
maybe,,Reinforcement Learning of Heuristic EV Fleet Charging in a Day-Ahead Electricity Market,"This paper addresses the problem of defining a day-ahead consumption plan for charging a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs), and following this plan during operation. A challenge herein is the beforehand unknown charging flexibility of EVs, which depends on numerous details about each EV (e.g., plug-in times, power limitations, battery size, power curve, etc.). To cope with this challenge, EV charging is controlled during opertion by a heuristic scheme, and the resulting charging behavior of the EV fleet is learned by using batch mode reinforcement learning. Based on this learned behavior, a cost-effective day-ahead consumption plan can be defined. In simulation experiments, our approach is benchmarked against a multistage stochastic programming solution, which uses an exact model of each EVs charging flexibility. Results show that our approach is able to find a day-ahead consumption plan with comparable quality to the benchmark solution, without requiring an exact day-ahead model of each EVs charging flexibility.",10.1109/TSG.2015.2393059,2015,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tsg.2015.2393059,2,low
maybe,,Design and Development of a Smart Control Strategy for Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles Including Vehicle-to-Home Functionality,"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are seen to be a step forward in transportation electrification, to replace internal combustion engine (ICE)-based conventional vehicles. However, to consider the vehicle-to-home (V2H) and home-tovehicle (H2V) capabilities, new energy control strategy has to be developed to avoid new peaks consumption. This paper presents a novel controller based on fuzzy logic, which integrates an objective state-of-charge (SoC) for V2H application. The V2H capability is used when the PHEV is connected to the home to help the grid to meet the household loads during peak period. The SoC objective is the minimum SoC that the PHEV has to have when the driver connects the PHEV to the home. The proposed controller is applied on fourth different scenario.",10.1109/TTE.2015.2426508,2015,ev,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tte.2015.2426508,2,low
needs_screen,,Fully Distributed Demand Response Using the Adaptive Diffusion–Stackelberg Algorithm,"In this paper, we consider the demand response problem in smart grid consisting of a retailer and multiple residential consumers, where the retailer determines consumers' payments based on their power consumption profile. Our aim is to propose a fully distributed algorithm that is able to optimize the aggregate cost, utility, and retailer's profit simultaneously. To this end, we first formulate the consumer-side trend as a constrained convex optimization problem and propose a fully distributed adaptive diffusion algorithm to solve it. In addition, we design a one-leader N-follower Stackelberg game to model interactions among the retailer and consumers. The proposed framework is able to continuously track the drifts resulting from the changes in the real-time pricing or the consumer preferences. Moreover, it is scalable and does not require network-wide information or rely on central controller. We provide comprehensive simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",10.1109/TII.2017.2703132,2017,,planning,merged_dedup.csv,10.1109/tii.2017.2703132,0,low
