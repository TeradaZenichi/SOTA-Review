However, the incorporation of the latter in system planning has yet to be comprehensively investigated. This paper proposes a novel planning model that allows co-optimizing the investment and operating costs of conventional generation assets and demand flexibility, in the form of smart-charging/discharging electric vehicles (EV). The model includes a detailed representation of EV operational constraints along with the generation technical characteristics, and accounts for the costs required to enable demand flexibility. Computational tractability is achieved through clustering generation units and EV, which allows massively reducing the number of decision variables and constraints, and avoiding non-linearities. Case studies in the context of the U.K. demonstrate the economic value of EV flexibility in reducing peak demand levels and absorbing wind generation variability, and the dependence of this value on the required enabling cost and users' traveling patterns.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2506003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362236","Demand flexibility;electric vehicles;generation expansion planning;mixed-integer programming;unit commitment;vehicle-to-grid;Demand flexibility;electric vehicles;generation expansion planning;mixed-integer programming;unit commitment;vehicle-to-grid","Batteries;Spinning;Heating;Planning;Electric vehicles;Computational modeling;Investment","","61","","28","IEEE","22 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To cope with the EV diffusion, this paper presents an adaptive fast charging station (FCS) strategy that considers the integrated network planning and quality of service (QoS) guarantee. First, based on the EV diffusion model and the proposed EV-integrated traffic assignment model, the charging demands at different regions and stages are forecasted. Based on the predicted spatial and temporal EV charging demand, a multistage stochastic distribution expansion planning model is presented, where the distribution network assets and FCSs are jointly considered. To guarantee the quality of the fast-charging services under EV diffusion, a QoS assessment is conducted based on the average waiting time and the average number of dissatisfied leaves. Finally, the proposed planning model allows several alternatives at both the distribution and transmission levels. The cost of electricity network expansion planning is considered as the adaptive cost arisen from the EV diffusion and the increase of the other electrical loads. We aim to find a planning strategy that can adapt to different penetration levels of EVs.

This paper proposes an optimal planning method for EV charging stations (EVCS) and distribution systems to accommodate the ever-increasing uncertainties. It is achieved by entailing PV-grid-EV transactions, which enables EVCS and PV prosumers to trade energy to make profits while complying with grid securities. It offers a cost-effective operational alternative to long-term planning, which would otherwise result in PV curtailment or unnecessary DNEP. The transactive market operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis and is cleared via a decentralized algorithm to protect privacy and enable autonomous decision-making. EVCS is incentivized by a designed network charge, quantifying its impact on adhering to security constraints from both long-term and short-term perspectives.

This paper studies the impacts of PHEV charging patterns on power system operations and scheduling. The stochastic unit commitment model described in this paper considers coordination of thermal generating units and PHEV charging loads, as well as the penetration of large-scale wind power. The proposed model also addresses ancillary services provided by vehicle-to-grid techniques. Daily electricity demands by various types of PHEVs are estimated on the basis of a PHEV population projection and transportation survey. The stochastic unit commitment model is used to simulate power system scheduling with different charging patterns for PHEVs. The results show that a smart charging pattern can reduce the operating costs of a power system and compensate for the fluctuation in wind power.

In our design, the global optimal power allocation under all local and global constraints is reached through peer-to-peer coordination of charging stations. Therefore, the need for a central control unit is eliminated. In this way, single-node congestion is avoided when the size of the problem is increased and the system gains robustness against single-link/node failures. Furthermore, via Monte Carlo simulations, we have demonstrated that the proposed distributed method is scalable with the number of charging points and returns solutions, which are comparable to centralized optimization algorithms with a maximum of 2% sub-optimality.

Therefore, proper planning and development of charging infrastructure are essential to promote EVs. This paper proposes a multi-objective formulation to determine fast charging stations’ optimal placement and sizing on intra-city corridors in a coupled transportation and Electrical Power Distribution Network (EPDN). The proposed formulation does a distance-based mapping between all transportation and EPDN nodes for precisely observing the impact of EV charging on EPDN. The proposed planning simultaneously considers the objectives and constraints of the transportation network and EPDN while satisfying the EV charging requirements. The EV charging demand, utilized in planning, is predicted using the Random Forest technique while considering the day type, hourly weather, and traffic flow that affect the forecasting accuracy. The improved Particle Swarm Optimization with Constriction Factor solves the proposed formulation for a 30-node EPDN coupled with a 25-node transportation network. The analysis of various cases, including varying initial State-Of-Charge of EVs and percentage growth of EVs per year, proves the efficacy and robustness of the proposed work. Note to Practitioners—The planned deployment of charging infrastructure is critical to facilitate EVs’ adoption and sustainable growth of EV industries. Since, EV charging stations couple transportation network and EPDN, the planning strategy should consider requirements of both networks. For satisfactory driving experience of EV users, the planning should also consider driving range constraints and charging requirements of EV users. Several works on charging infrastructure planning have been carried out. However, several aspects relevant to EV users, transportation networks, EPDN, and determining EV charging demand have been overlooked in existing literature (as evidenced through Table I). These aspects must be considered simultaneously while planning charging stations. Hence, this work proposes a planning strategy for optimal placement and sizing of fast EV charging stations in a metropolitan city connecting multiple suburbs while considering several aspects of transportation networks and EPDNs. The proposed strategy can be utilized by utilities for efficient deployment of charging infrastructure on metropolitan city intra-city corridors. It establishes a distance-based mapping between all transportation and EPDN nodes for observing the impact of EV charging on EPDN. The determination of EV charging demand is a crucial step in the planning, which is determined by forecasting hourly traffic flow while considering several key attributes. The proposed approach achieves the EPDN objectives of reducing power loss, voltage deviation, and total charging stations’ establishment cost, and transportation network objectives of maximising captured traffic flow while satisfying driving range constraints and charging requirements of EVs. Therefore, the focus is to utilize the existing grid infrastructure optimally while achieving the objectives and satisfying constraints of EV users, transportation network, and EPDN. Relevant case studies demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of proposed approach. The uncertainties in EVs’ injections and arrival/departure times will be considered in our future work.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3293955","Department of Science and Technology and Indo–U.S. Science and Technology Forum, New Delhi, India, under an Indo–U.S. Collaborative Project US-India Collaborative for Smart DiStribution System With Storage (UI-ASSIST) with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur(grant numbers:IUSSTF/EE/2017282B); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190098","Charging station;electric vehicle;placement;electrical power distribution network;sizing;smart grid;transportation system","Transportation;Planning;Electric vehicle charging;Charging stations;Costs;Batteries;Urban areas;Climate change;Power distribution networks;Smart grids","","17","","48","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The FMMILP model explicitly considers these uncertainties and aims to minimize total production cost and carbon emissions while ensuring reliable and sustainable power system operation. The effective solution method for solving FMMILP is explained. The FMMILP model is applied to Thailand’s national power system, characterized by its diverse generation mix, substantial RES penetration, and growing EV adoption. A comprehensive stochastic reliability analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation is performed, incorporating a wide range of supply and demand scenarios, including extreme worst-case scenarios, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models. These scenarios incorporate optimal solutions from UC and RES dispatch patterns. Three distinct FMMILP models are compared against a deterministic UC benchmark in the rainy, summer, and winter seasons. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the FMMILP model achieves optimal solutions within acceptable computational time and significantly enhances system reliability compared to the deterministic model, with reliability improvements of 15.99%, 26.14%, and 51.44% in the rainy season, summer season, and winter season, respectively.

The planning algorithm specifies optimal locations and sizes of the EV charging stations and DG units that minimize two conflicting objectives: 1) deployment and operation costs and 2) associated green house gas emissions, while satisfying the microgrid technical constraints. This is achieved by iteratively solving a multi-objective mixed integer non-linear program. An outer sub-problem determines the locations and sizes of the DG units and charging stations using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm.

This paper proposes a comprehensive model for the expansion planning of urban electrified transportation networks (ETNs), which determines the best investment strategies for the TN and the power distribution network (PDN) simultaneously, including the sites and sizes of new lanes, charging facilities, distribution lines, and local generators. The steady-state distribution of traffic flow in the TN is characterized by the Nesterov user equilibrium (NUE). The operating condition of the PDN is described by linearized branch power flow equations. To consider the interdependency between the TN and PDN created by the charging behavior of EVs, the power demand of on-road charging facility is assumed to be proportional to the traffic flow it carries. The expansion planning model is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with NUE constraints. In order to retrieve a global optimal solution, it is further transformed into an equivalent mixedinteger convex program through duality theory and techniques of integer algebra; no approximation error is involved.

The approach incorporates spatial demand forecasting, photovoltaic (PV) system sizing, M/M/c queuing analysis, and agent-based modeling (ABM) to evaluate both wired and wireless EV charging strategies. Real demographic and mobility data from ten Riyadh Metro station zones are used to estimate daily EV arrival rates and charging demand, enabling location-specific infrastructure planning. Photovoltaic-powered wireless charging is introduced as a demand-shaping mechanism to relieve fast-charging congestion and reduce grid dependency. The model shows that serving 40 % of the daily EV load wirelessly can reduce charger requirements by up to 60 % and lower average queue delays by more than 80 %. A PV system sizing analysis based on Riyadh’s solar insolation estimates annual energy yields up to 860 MWh per station and total carbon emission avoidance exceeding 1,000 tons  $CO_{2}$  per year. The queuing analysis highlights the critical role of wireless load share and session duration in maintaining system stability, while the agent-based simulation models user behavior under real-time pricing and charger constraints.

A scalable and pervasive communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we present the background and motivation of communication infrastructures in smart grid systems. We also summarize major requirements that smart grid communications must meet. From the experience of several industrial trials on smart grid with communication infrastructures, we expect that the traditional carbon fuel based power plants can cooperate with emerging distributed renewable energy such as wind, solar, etc, to reduce the carbon fuel consumption and consequent green house gas such as carbon dioxide emission. The consumers can minimize their expense on energy by adjusting their intelligent home appliance operations to avoid the peak hours and utilize the renewable energy instead. We further explore the challenges for a communication infrastructure as the part of a complex smart grid system. Since a smart grid system might have over millions of consumers and devices, the demand of its reliability and security is extremely critical. Through a communication infrastructure, a smart grid can improve power reliability and quality to eliminate electricity blackout.

As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to penetrate transportation systems, optimal integration of EVCSs within power distribution infrastructure becomes critical, not only to ensure seamless user experience but also to maintain the reliability and efficiency of electrical networks. Traditionally, EVCS planning has been carried out solely within the context of Radial Distribution Networks (RDNs), neglecting key consumer-centric factors such as travel comfort and accessibility within the road network (RN). This paper proposes a novel, consumer-aware methodology for optimally placing EVCSs and Distributed Generators (DGs) in a combined RDN-RN framework. The objective is to minimize active power loss, voltage variation, and EV consumer cost, measured through two proposed indices, while accounting for realistic travel behavior and preferences. The proposed approach utilizes a Modified Weighted Teaching Learning Based - Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (MWTLB-PSA) and proceeds in three stages: EVCS site selection based on road network considerations, DG placement using predetermined EVCS locations, and a final stage of simultaneous optimization of both elements. To validate the approach, a standard IEEE 33-bus RDN integrated with a 25-node RN is employed as the test system. Results demonstrate that the joint optimization of DGs and EVCSs via the proposed method significantly enhances network performance and consumer convenience. Notably, the solution achieves a reduced active power loss of 57.75 kW and an EVCCI value of 0.3958, indicating a substantial improvement over existing hybrid TLBO and PSO-based techniques. Furthermore, the proposed method leads to installation cost savings ranging from 2.51% to 18.21% compared to earlier strategies, underscoring its practical value in smart grid planning and deployment.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2025.11194767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11194767","Distributed energy resources;Electric vehicle charging stations;Energy management;Electric vehicle;Metaheuristic algorithms;Multi-objective optimization;Power distribution systems;Smart grid planning","Optimization;Voltage;Planning;Power system stability;Costs;Electric vehicle charging;Reliability;Stability criteria;Transportation;Generators","","","","","IEEE","7 Oct 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The integration of solar energy has increased to meet this increased demand. Hence, due to the inappropriate integration of Solar-based Distributed Generations, the system gets unbalanced with increased losses, voltage profile imbalance, poor fault tolerance capability, and reliability issues. Also, it is impossible to fulfill the increased reactive power demand of the Distribution Network by these DGs. Therefore, in this work, to address these issues, the appropriate planning of hybrid Solar-DG Integrated DSTATCOM in a reconfigured DN with Exponential Load Model (ExpLM), including EV Charging Station load impacts, is presented considering the Sustainable Development Goals: Techno-Enviro-Economic challenges. The presented work's effectiveness is established on a modernized practical 33-bus DN using APSO, GWO-PSO, TLBO, and HBA by optimizing the TEE parameters. The considered techno parameters of the DN are Active Power Loss, Reactive Power Loss, Voltage Deviation, Level of Line Fault Current, and Service Reliability, which makes up the Multiple-Objective Fitness Problem. Similarly, the economic and enviro performance parameters are the Cost for Slack Bus Generation, Cost for Fixed Capital Recovery, Cost for Energy Lost, Cost for Energy Not Supplied, Total Cost, Cost for Solar-DG Integrated DSTATCOM, Saving Cost, Pay Back Period, and Environmental Particle Emission. By addressing the TEE challenges, the three key emerging SDGs have been addressed which are SDG 7, SDG 12, and SDG 15.

The charging demand necessary for EV transportation is performed using a vehicle model based on travel patterns. The variability associated with RES along with the demand requires the incorporation of uncertainty, which is characterized through a set of scenarios. These scenarios are generated by the k-means++ clustering technique that allows keeping the correlation in the information of the uncertainty sources. The resulting stochastic program is driven by the minimization of the present value of the total expected cost including investment, maintenance, production, losses, and non-supplied energy.

This study focuses on strategic expansion planning, incorporating the optimal placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and port numbers in an overlapped road and distribution network. It also addresses the replacement of branch conductors to prevent network overloads, along with optimal scheduling of electric vehicle (EV) loads to reduce its impact during peak loading conditions. Further, the increase in the harmonic distortion due to the increasing EVCSs and other nonlinear loads is mitigated through the optimal allocation of active power filters (APFs). Transformer derating due to harmonics is also evaluated, and the transformer rating is upgraded accordingly. For robust expansion planning, future load demand is predicted using Random Forest (RF) regression, while uncertainties in EV driving patterns are managed using the 2m-point estimation method (2m-PEM). During solution of the expansion planning problem, this paper focuses on minimizing energy losses and costs while maximizing the average happiness index (AHI) of the EV users.

The two most loaded distribution transformers of such a neighborhood are studied along with their cable feeders via steady-state simulations in CYME software. A worst case scenario of full EV penetration is studied, where all chargers are connected to the system simultaneously at the peak summer or winter load. The effect of increasing the rate of EV adoption on the performance of distribution networks is examined with correlation to the ambient temperature. Finally, the impact of increasing the charger size on system performance is explored. The results send a few warning signals of potential equipment overload to utility companies under certain system loading and EV charging levels as EV use grows, impacting utility future planning and operation.

However, a single type of charging or swapping facility cannot simultaneously and efficiently satisfy the power supply requirements of diverse vehicle types. In order to solve this problem, a joint planning method of charging piles and charging-battery swapping stations (CBSSs) is proposed in this paper. In this method, the influence of geospatial constraints on the layout scale of charging piles is considered, and the Monte Carlo simulation method is used to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of charging and battery swapping demands of private electric vehicles (PEVs) and the battery swapping demands of taxi electric vehicles (TEVs) respectively. On this basis, the layout scale of charging piles of each functional area is determined during the maximum charging demand period in a day to meet the demands of PEVs for charging convenience. Then, an operating state model of CBSS is established for calculation of the objective function. At the same time, a planning model of CBSSs is established to minimize the annual social comprehensive cost, which takes into account the economy of CBSSs and the battery swapping convenience of EVs. The planning of CBSSs can meet the demands of TEVs and some PEVs for a rapid power supply. Finally, using the urban transportation network of Changchun and IEEE 33-node system as an example, the planning of charging piles and CCBSs in direct charging mode and peak shifting mode are simulated and analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed method enables PEVs and TEVs to access convenient and rapid power supply, and the planning result of CBSSs in direct charging mode is more economical, while peak shifting mode is more conducive to the safe operation of distribution networks.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2021.05780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9862567","Charging-battery swapping station;charging piles;electric vehicle;joint planning;spatiotemporal distribution of the charging and battery swapping demands","Batteries;Planning;Charging stations;Decision making;Costs;Electric vehicles;Capacity planning","","2","","39","","18 Aug 2022","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Additionally, there have been notable advancements in new energy research, which have significantly improved the viability of EVs. Consequently, EVs have gained widespread recognition and have been rapidly adopted in many countries worldwide. However, the rapid growth of EVs has given rise to several challenges, such as insufficient charging infrastructure, unequal distribution, high costs, and a lack of charging stations, which have become increasingly significant. The limited availability of charging facilities is hindering the widespread adoption of EVs. However, as more people embrace EVs, there has been a growth in the installation of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) in public locations. Recent research has focused on identifying the ideal locations for EVCSs in order to assist the electrification of transport systems and meet the growing demand for EVs. A well-developed EVCS infrastructure can help address some key issues facing EVs, such as pricing and range limitations. Researchers have used various methodologies, objective functions, and constraints to formulate the problem of identifying the best sites for EVCSs. Current research is focused on determining the best locations for EVCSs. This endeavor intends to ease the transition to electrified transport networks while also addressing the growing demand for EVs. This review article explores various optimization techniques to achieve optimal solutions while considering the impact of EV charging load on the distribution system (DS), environmental implications, and economic impact.

To overcome this research gap, this article integrates the interests of traffic networks into PDS and FCS joint planning model to mitigate negative impacts on traffic conditions caused by installing FCSs. First, a novel microscopic method that is different from traditional assignment methods is proposed to simulate the influences of FCSs on traffic flows and EV charging loads. Then, a multiobjective joint planning model is developed to minimize both the planning costs and unbalanced traffic flows. A new bilayer Benders decomposition algorithm is designed to solve the proposed joint planning model.

Due to their rapid response, batteries are attractive for providing ancillary services (AS), such as frequency regulation and reserve services, to the bulk power grid. On the other hand, an electric vehicle (EV) is viewed as a moving battery; consequently, EVs are also suitable for those services. This research proposes a linear planning model for an Electric Vehicle Aggregator (EVA) within a distribution network (DN) to offer Ancillary Services (AS) to the bulk power grid. The model takes into account contract design by identifying optimal incentives or charging tariffs that Electric Vehicle (EV) owners would be willing to pay the EVA for charging their vehicles. Additionally, the model takes into account the size of the electric vehicle (EV) fleet as a crucial planning factor for EV aggregation that depends on the energy pricing set by the EVA. The proposed model is developed to maximize the overall profit of bidding capacities in the energy and AS markets while supporting the operation of an unbalanced DN by maintaining the DN limits. Simulation results and sensitivity analyses on the model have been carried out to support the investment model and investigate the change in the optimal solution across different case studies. Simulations show that the optimal charging tariff ( $\beta $ ) is ( $0.02~{\$}/kWh$ )when considering scenarios where Distribution Network (DN) limits, such as thermal and voltage constraints, are ignored for all EV participation versus  $\beta $  relations.

Improving the self-healing capability of the smart grid is referred to as healer reinforcement. In this paper, a new healer reinforcement approach is introduced, contributing PHEVs, through optimal parking lot (PL) placement and sizing, under contingencies, by considering the available control and protective devices. Moreover, the PL placement and sizing problem formulation is extended by considering PHEVs participation as both backup and storage units in the self-healing process. PHEVs contribution as backup units could provide electricity for faulted zone customers. Furthermore, demand variations during the restoration might lead to congestion occurrence in the backup feeder. Hence, the PHEVs contribution as storage units could prevent congestion occurrence and enable execution of the best restoration strategy, through charging in light load and injecting power to the backup feeding path in the peak load of repair time. In addition, the stochastic nature of PHEV owners' behavior is modeled in service restoration and the possibility of reactive power injection by PLs is considered in the service restoration process. The proposed formulation is applied to a standard test system (RBTS-4) to minimize a combined effect of the customer-based (SAIDI) and cost-based (TCR) reliability indices.

As EVs affect both systems, it is necessary to consider both grid operation and transportation-network operation simultaneously. In this study, an integrated operation algorithm for the transportation network and power grid has been developed, which determines the amount of demand response through the power-flow results at the upper level and resolves traffic congestion by setting the optimal route for EVs at the lower level. The Demand Response (DR) adjustment amount is determined based on MATSim vehicle data, rather than simply looking at the DR amount from the perspective of the power system. Furthermore, the concept of Autonomous Integrated EVs (AIEV) in the integrated system has been constructed, which improves the grid stability to cope with uncooperative EVs. The transportation system is configured using MATSim to run the integrated simulation, and the power system is configured using the IEEE-33 bus model.

Two different strategies which consider an integrated grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid charging framework are utilized in this paper for smart charging of PEVs. The objective functions of the two strategies, namely minimization of total daily cost and minimization of peak-to-average ratio, represent an economic and a technical perspective, respectively. The proposed HPM is based on optimally allocating two different charging strategies at different nodes of the distribution system during the planning horizon.

Once the lower-level trading is completed, EVCSs trade energy at the upper level through the power grid network managed by the distribution system operator (DSO). The upper-level market is cleared while satisfying the power distribution network constraints. A cooperative game-based model is proposed to model the energy trading among EVCSs. To this end, the asymmetric Nash bargaining method is applied to allocate the grand coalition’s payoff to each EVCS at the upper-level market, while a weighted proportional allocation method is used to allocate individual EVCS’s payoff to its respective EVs at the lower-level market. The upper-level market formulation is further decomposed into two subproblems representing an energy scheduling and trading subproblem which maximizes EVCS payoffs, and a bargaining subproblem which allocates EVCS payoffs.

Based on this, a tailored deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is proposed to direct the concerned expansion problem, of which the objective is to enhance social welfare while adhering to specific economic and technical constraints. The proposed model leverages an attention mechanism and an inflation coefficient to enable the agent to selectively focus on dominant features and effectively adapt to variable planning schemes.

Charging station siting and sizing are two key challenges in the planning with each of them being a complex optimization problem. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to solve them together. First, considering that accurate charging demand estimation is crucial for planning, a traffic road network is established for this purpose. A Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of charging demand in a region based on the probabilistic characteristics of user trips. Since uncoordinated charging not only increases the load but also leads to unstable operation of the local power system, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to coordinate charging scheduling. Then, based on the scheduled demand, this paper proposes a framework for the siting and sizing of charging stations to optimize the benefits for both operators and users by minimizing the construction, operation and maintenance costs, and the user’s detour time. As the given problem is a complex multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, it is easy to fall into local optimum if traditional evolutionary algorithms are employed. Therefore, a multi-objective dynamic binary particle swarm optimization method is designed to solve this problem effectively. Finally, experimental simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the other comparative algorithms in terms of solution quality. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing the location and capacity of charging stations.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2024.3498917","Key Research and Development Project of China(grant numbers:2021YFB1600100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52172325,61902039); Project; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M733068); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities, Chang’an University (CHD)(grant numbers:3001022422,300102244204); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767844","Electric vehicle;charging station planning;multi-objective optimization;charging scheduling;Monte Carlo simulation","Planning;Optimization;Costs;Electric vehicle charging;Roads;State of charge;Particle swarm optimization;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Maintenance;Heuristic algorithms","","4","","35","IEEE","26 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the first stage, a home-based charging control method is formulated in which the charging cost of PHEVs is considered as an objective. Running this procedure by PHEV schedulers in houses, in the second stage of the proposed strategy, the PHEV coordinator agent (PCA) applies a multicriteria optimization framework to reach optimal charging plans with respect to both the vehicles owners' and system operator's perspectives. Total losses of the distribution system, total rescheduling costs, and wind energy utilization for PHEV charging are those factors that are modeled in the second stage.

To support this transition, the expansion of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) has become essential to meet the increasing charging demand. However, although EV usage can reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation sector, existing planning approaches often overlook the CO2 emissions generated by the construction of EVCSs. This omission may undermine the environmental benefits of EV adoption, as the cost of mitigating construction-related emissions could offset the savings from reduced transportation emissions. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel EVCS expansion framework that integrates construction-related CO2 emission cost into the overall optimization model. The proposed approach jointly considers the costs incurred by Charging Station Owners (CSOs), EV users, and the environmental impact from EVCS construction. A realistic urban road network and EV charging behavior are modeled in detail, and Binary Differential Evolution (BDE) is employed to determine the optimal sizing and locations of EVCSs. The results demonstrate that incorporating construction-related CO2 emission costs leads to a total cost reduction of 2.06% compared to conventional methods that do not consider such CO2 emissions. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating environmental externalities, such as construction-related CO2 emissions, into infrastructure planning to reduce long-term costs, mitigate potential carbon tax impacts, and support cost-effective and sustainable EVCS deployment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3609874","Research on Optimal Sizing and Location of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Considering Carbon Footprint of Construction from the Fundamental Fund of Khon Kaen University from National Science, Research and Innovation Fund or NSRF, Thailand, the Research and Graduate Studies, Khon Kaen University; Faculty of Engineering, Khon Kaen University(grant numbers:M-EE-2023/004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11164275","Binary differential evolution;charging station expansion;construction cost of EVCS;CO₂ emission;electric vehicle","Costs;Linear programming;Investment;Charging stations;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Voltage;Indexes;Electric vehicle charging;Power system reliability","","","","52","CCBYNCND","15 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electric vehicle chargers integrate with distribution networks via power electronic interfaces, offering significant control and operational flexibility. The industry is quickly adapting to this rapidly emerging load type, and now requires a robust means for understanding their impact on power system operations. This paper presents a modeling approach to capture the aggregate dynamic impact of these chargers on the power system in response to a range of network fault conditions. Six commonly available electric vehicles were empirically tested under various supply disturbances using a grid simulator, and their fault ride-through performances have been characterised. The undervoltage withstand capability of the six vehicles varied considerably, with fault voltage thresholds ranging between 0.3 and 0.7 pu leading to electric vehicles either ceasing charging for between ∼2 and 10 seconds, or locking out completely. A composite dynamic load model for electric vehicles was developed and validated, employing the collected empirical data. The validation process demonstrated the aggregate load model's capability to accurately capture the resulting load deficit owing to electric vehicle fault ride-through in response to transmission-level faults. The proposed model is suitable for application in wide-area power system studies to enhance the accuracy of simulated network load response for frequency assessments, operations planning, and other system analyses.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2025.3561758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10967063","Electric vehicles;practical testing;fault ride-through;power system modeling;power system stability;voltage sags;distributed energy resources;aggregate load model","Load modeling;Power system dynamics;Power systems;Aggregates;Power system stability;Vehicle dynamics;Voltage;Distribution networks;Distributed power generation;Australia","","","","33","IEEE","16 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, research on BE mode is still only limited. This paper aims at estimating the reliability impact caused by EVs using BE mode. First, the behavior of EV users under BE mode are extracted from two reliable databases. The behavior extraction method is developed specifically for BE mode, which is modified based on a method originally designed for plug-in mode. Afterwards, power system reliability is studied from the viewpoint of both the power system and the EV users by introducing a new reliability index named User Demand Not Satisfied (UDNS).

This paper adds three original contributions to this literature. First, it uses stochastic dynamic programming to optimize PHEV power management over a distribution of drive cycles, rather than a single cycle. Second, it explicitly trades off fuel and electricity usage in a PHEV, thereby systematically exploring the potential benefits of controlled charge depletion over aggressive charge depletion followed by charge sustenance. Finally, it examines the impact of variations in relative fuel-to-electricity pricing on optimal PHEV power management. The paper focuses on a single-mode power-split PHEV configuration for mid-size sedans, but its approach is extendible to other configurations and sizes as well.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2010.2043736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439900","Dynamic programming;Markov process;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV);power management;powertrain control;powertrain modeling","Stochastic processes;Optimal control;Energy management;Hybrid electric vehicles;Power system management;Power demand;Actuators;Engines;Electric machines;Constraint optimization","","455","3","38","IEEE","29 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Renewable energy resources must take a bigger share in the generation mix, effective demand response must be widely implemented, and high-capacity energy storage systems must be developed. A smart grid is necessary to manage and control the increasingly complex future grid. Certain smart grid elements—renewables, storage, microgrid, consumer choice, and smart appliances—increase uncertainty in both supply and demand of electric power. Other smart gird elements—sensors, smart meters, demand response, and communications—provide more accurate information about the power system and more refined means of control. Simply building hardware for renewable generators and the smart grid, but still using the same operating paradigm of the grid, will not realize the full potential for overall system efficiency and carbon reduction. In this paper, a new operating paradigm, called risk-limiting dispatch, is proposed. It treats generation as a heterogeneous commodity of intermittent or stochastic power and uses information and control to design hedging techniques to manage the risk of uncertainty.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2080250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5618534","Power system control;power system operation;real-time control;smart grid","Smart grids;Generators;Load management;Meteorology;Renewable energy resources;Load flow control;Climate change","","391","4","46","IEEE","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the expected deep penetration of renewable energy sources, energy storage devices, demand side management (DSM) tools, and electric vehicles (EVs) in the future smart grid, there exist significant technical challenges on power system planning and operation.

Hence, the model identifies the best size, location, and installation time for the candidate assets under the uncertainty associated with electricity demand, energy prices, renewable energy sources, and EVCSs’ load profiles. Unlike classical planning approaches, conventional load is modeled as voltage-dependent. Besides, EVCSs are planned by zones to optimize the coverage of the service provided to users of electric vehicles and to reduce the discrepancy between the geographical requirements and the optimal locations for the installation of EVCSs in the system. EVCSs’ load profiles are calculated using a travel simulation algorithm based on real travel patterns that consider fast, slow, and residential chargers. Moreover, as another salient feature, constraints for CO2 emissions are incorporated into the model.

A number of studies have shown that second-life batteries (SLBs) from EVs usually have a considerable remaining capacity and hence still have additional utilization value. This article proposes a novel fuzzy inference system (FIS)-based planning framework for EV charging stations with wind, PV power, battery energy storage system and the utilization of SLBs (EVCS-WPE-SLBs system). In this framework, a narrowed and the most probable candidate node set for EVCS-WPE-SLBs system which makes the trade-off of several off-site factors from different fields that jointly determine the optimal planning results is obtained, including the installation and utilization requirements of SLBs, the transportation network features and power system properties. Numerical case studies are conducted on a coupled IEEE 33-bus distribution system and 25-node transportation system. According to the simulation results, the reasonable utilization of SLBs in the EVCS-WPE-SLBs system can reduce the total system cost while maintaining the normal operation of the system. Besides, a narrowed and most probable candidate node set not only reduces the search space and simplifies the optimization problem, but the results obtained are more practical according to the actual system conditions in real life.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3324001","ARC Research Hub(grant numbers:IH180100020); ARC Training Centre(grant numbers:IC200100023); ARC linkage project(grant numbers:LP200100056); ARC(grant numbers:DP220103881); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10283850","EV charging station planning;fuzzy inference system;renewable energy;battery energy storage system;second-life batteries (SLBs)","Planning;Costs;Fuzzy logic;Electric vehicle charging;Renewable energy sources;Charging stations;Battery energy storage system","","12","","30","IEEE","12 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In other words, whether EVs can help emission reduction depends on the energy system configuration and the power generation mix. To achieve the overall emission reduction in both systems, a collaborative planning strategy for electricity and transportation systems is proposed. In the electricity distribution network, the renewable energy source is planned to cope with future demand growth due to the increasing use of EVs. In the transportation network, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are introduced to realize the coordinated development of different types of vehicles. The location of the hydrogen refueling stations can be planned, and the penetration ratio of internal combustion vehicles, EVs, and FCVs is optimized.

Most previous studies have assumed a fixed charging location and fixed charging time during the off-peak hours for anticipating electric vehicle charging demand. Some other studies have based on limited charging scenarios at typical locations instead of a mathematical model. Therefore, from a distribution system perspective, electric vehicle charging demand is still unidentified quantity which may vary by space and time. In this context, this study proposes a mathematical model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station. The mathematical model is based on the fluid dynamic traffic model and the M/M/s queueing theory. Firstly, the arrival rate of discharged vehicles at a charging station is predicted by the fluid dynamic model. Then, charging demand is forecasted by the M/M/s queueing theory with the arrival rate of discharged vehicles. This mathematical model of charging demand may allow grid's distribution planners to anticipate a charging demand profile at a charging station. A numerical example shows that the proposed model is able to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of charging demand in a highway charging station.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2159278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959242","Charging demand;charging station;electric vehicle;energy management;modeling;planning;Poisson processes;power demand;power distribution planning;spatial and temporal model","Road transportation;Vehicles;Mathematical model;Queueing analysis;Numerical models;Batteries;Equations","","401","","37","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from most previous works, the presented method explicitly considers the potential uncertainties in the users’ behaviors in the PL planning, which will allow decision-makers to better assess the effect of human factors on the efficiency of their investment. Moreover, the concerned PL allocation problem has been investigated in conjunction with the optimal contract offer for PEV users to obtain the final planning scheme.

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from $2.52 to $0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106% to 14%, respectively. It is also realized that the integration of PV improves voltage profile and reduces the negative impact of EV load. Our optimization model can work for commercial areas such as offices, university campuses, and industries as well as residential colonies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050479","Charging stations placement;distribution system;electric vehicles (EVs);optimization","Charging stations;Load modeling;Planning;Mathematical model;Electric vehicle charging;Photovoltaic systems","","194","","32","CCBY","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An emphasis is on evaluation of electric vehicle scheduling and demand side management. The main benefit of this new simultaneous optimization approach is that it converges towards a global optimum by considering not only infrastructure investments but also energy cost changes due to scheduling measures as for example curtailment or demand side management. The article firstly analyzes degrees of freedom in grid planning and in scheduling to derive models. The sections thereafter present the algorithm for simultaneous optimization. It integrates a fast scheduling optimization into a meta-heuristic grid-planning algorithm. The grid-planning algorithm uses Delaunay triangulation and an ant colony systems approach. The scheduling optimization combines dynamic programming and a fast heuristic to consider grid constraints. The last section presents exemplary results and illustrates effects of different regulatory regimes on costs. Results suggest that market-based scheduling will prevail due to energy cost-savings. However, purely market-based scheduling is unattractive when grid costs are considered.

The model considers the range anxiety and battery aging anxiety of EVs in the response scheduling process, which effectively improves the willingness of EVs to respond to scheduling. The model mainly involves three aspects: charging station siting, determination of EV incentive electricity price and realization of distributed dispatching. First, this paper proposes a three-step weighted mean clustering method to plan charging station siting, which reduces the driving distance of EVs when responding to grid dispatching, thus reducing range anxiety. At the same time, we studied the effect of different modifications in practical applications. Subsequently, we established an incentive price model for EVs to achieve reasonable quantitative compensation for the battery aging problem that occurs during the dispatch process. Finally, we propose a distributed scheduling strategy to improve the willingness of EVs to respond. This study is validated using real-world data from the city of Chicago. The proposed method reduces the average response distance of EVs in Chicago by 0.188 km and increases the participation willingness of EVs by 0.3243.

This leads to opportunities for different market parties to use the flexibility of EVs for various objectives that may be conflicting and result in a nonoptimal shifting of peak demands for the distribution grids. In this paper, we assess the financial impact of various EV charging strategies on distribution grids. We compare a strategy that minimizes network peak loads (from a network operators perspective) with a strategy to minimize charging costs (from the perspective of a commercial party). In a scenario with a high wind penetration in the system, the electricity prices are, for a significant part, determined by the instantaneous wind production. Therefore, we additionally study the effect of wind energy on electricity prices and, consequently, on the resulting EV load and network impacts. We obtain the network costs by calculating the impacts expressed in the net present value (NPV) of the investments costs and energy losses. We found that, in the case where EVs are basing their charge schedules on electricity prices, the increase in NPV compared with a no EV scenario was found to be 25% higher than in the case where the extra peak load due to EVs was minimized. The large difference in network impacts between the price based and network based charging strategies was only observed in the case with a high wind penetration. The results strongly suggest that the situation where EVs are controlled with a strategy to minimize charging costs that does not take the distribution grids into account may not lead to an optimal situation when the entire electricity delivery system is regarded.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2355494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905855","Electric vehicles (EVs);load management;power distribution system planning;smart grids;Electric vehicles (EVs);load management;power distribution system planning;smart grids","Electricity;Loading;Optimization;Vehicles;Batteries;Smart grids;Energy loss","","293","","20","IEEE","19 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, one of the major challenges to the rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the lack of the right charging infrastructure where and when it is needed. Motivated by the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach, this study addresses the complex operational and planning challenges involved in integrating transportation and electrical networks for effective EV charging. Thus, this research aims to survey the literature to identify the adopted technologies, and the application and allocation of the right mix of the technologies to better serve the seamless adoption of EVs. That problem is multifaced where transportation network requirements and the electrical grid are important to support the charging loads at the needed time. The literature survey adopts the PRISMA methodology, contributing to the existing literature by highlighting the following shortcomings: 1) the problem of allocating the charging technology is either purely viewed from a transportation or an electrical perspective, 2) there is a gap in adopting both networks’ requirements comprehensively, 3) the literature predominately focuses on a single technology either battery swapping or wireless charging, 4) introducing new technologies highlights the impact of each on both networks in terms of return of investment, traffic flows, and power grids operational conditions, 5) research direction is focused more towards operation and routing while service allocation is relatively new and has not yet been extensively explored, and 6) transportation network research focuses on a static representation of the transportation network and EV demand. This study’s main contribution, besides identifying critical gaps in the existing literature and possible future research directions, is the proposal of a novel framework that integrates multiple charging technologies.

However, the increasing adoption of EVs and PVs has introduced unprecedented challenges to the reliability of power systems. The challenge lies in the inherent intermittency associated with solar generation and the uncertainty introduced by the charging load of EVs on the demand side of power grids. Therefore, it is indispensable from the perspective of power system operation and planning to consider the uncertainties associated with the output power of these resources in the reliability assessment framework. This paper develops an electric vehicle load model considering diverse charging station locations, EV types, and drivers' behavior. Also, the proposed method integrates the uncertainty of PV generation through interval prediction utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors regressor. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze the impact of PV interval (forecasted lower and upper generation profile), EV load (hourly and peak), line failures, and demographic characteristics associated with EV on power system reliability. The reliability assessment is extended to sensitivity analysis and evaluation of the impact of EV loads and PV generation profiles on the capacity value of PV generators with different capacities, utilizing the Discrete Convolution approach.

This interplay, if neglected, can result in uncovered EVs and security issues and even hinder the effective diffusion of EVs. In this paper, we explicitly incorporate this interdependence by quantifying EV adoption rates as decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) using decision-dependent ambiguity sets (DDASs). Then, a two-stage decision-dependent distributionally robust FCS planning (D3R-FCSP) model is developed for adaptively deploying FCSs with on-site sources and expanding the coupled distribution network. A multi-period capacitated arc cover-path cover (MCACPC) model is incorporated to capture the EVs’ recharging patterns to ensure the feasibility of FCS locations and capacities. To resolve the nonlinearity and nonconvexity, the D3R-FCSP model is equivalently reformulated into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming by exploiting its strong duality and applying the McCormick envelope.

To properly address distinct roles as well as interactions of the EVCS planner, traffic network, power distribution networks (PDNs), and drivers, this paper explores a bilevel planning model in which the upper level determines EVCS and DCFC construction plans and the two lower-level subproblems describe the user equilibrium-based traffic assignment model of the traffic network and the operation model of PDNs. Moreover, the statistical charging time is modeled in the traffic network subproblem as a function of statistical charging demand and the number of DCFCs, leveraging the macro traffic pattern and micro charging behavior of individual drivers with balanced accuracy and computational complexity. The proposed model also captures the impacts of social factors, charging infrastructure, and driver behaviors on dynamic EV traffic demands. Reformulation and linearization techniques are applied to convert the proposed bilevel problem into a tractable single-level mixed-integer linear programming model for effective computation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on an intercity highway network with multiple PDNs. The findings from numerical case studies highlight the important interplay among the construction plans of EVCSs and DCFCs, the PDN constraints, the user equilibrium traffic network, and the EV drivers. Case studies illustrate the feasibility and necessity of considering the number of DCFCs to calculate the macro-perspective charging time in the user equilibrium traffic network model. The dynamic traffic demand, induced by social factors and traffic demand elasticity, was also found to be a crucial factor in reshaping EV traffic. Thus, properly considering these important factors would lead to a more accurate quantification of traffic demands and ultimately result in a more reasonable charging facility construction plan.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2023.3275013","PSEG Foundation Gift; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10122631","EVCS planning;bilevel optimization;user equilibrium;social factors;dynamic traffic demand","Vehicles;Planning;Behavioral sciences;Costs;Vehicle dynamics;Social factors;Power system dynamics","","25","","44","IEEE","10 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, an integrated procedure is proposed for the charging service provider to optimally plan fast charging stations integrated with PV and ESS in urban area, while taking the influence of its competitors, EV users' decision-making psychology, the uncertainties of charging demand and PV power output into consideration. Firstly, a charging demand estimation method based on average travel speed is presented.

In this context, a multistage low-carbon EV CFs planning model is proposed in this paper for the coupled transportation and power systems. This model not only takes into account the construction costs of newly-built CFs and their adverse impacts on the distribution system, but also considers the carbon emissions of CFs and the penalty due to the inconvenience for EVs to be recharged. In addition, a rational travel route choice model is significantly important to accurately evaluate the service capability of CFs to be constructed and thereby to obtain an optimal CF planning result. Therefore, a novel travel route choice model developed in this work allows EV drivers to take detours according to the CF locations to charge their EVs multiple times and then finish their trips. Carbon emission flow (CEF) model is innovatively employed to precisely calculate CFs’ carbon emission amount from the perspective of consumption side. Subsequently, uncertainties involved in CF planning, i.e., distribution and growth rate of traffic flow and electric load, popularity of different types of EVs, as well as location of the connected node of clean electricity, are fully considered to obtain a robust CF planning scheme that can achieve a good performance in the current stage and exhibit robustness for the uncertainties in the future stage.

An analysis based on an equivalent model clearly reveals that two key factors impact network stability when EVCSs are interconnected: 1) the dynamic interaction between an individual EVCS and the remainder of DC network; 2) the topology and parameters of the DC network. In the worst case, the integration of a large number EVCSs can result ingrowing oscillations in the DC network, which is related to the high-frequency filter oscillation modes of EVCSs. Based on the results, a computationally simple, reduced-order modal analysis method for approximately assessing the small-signal stability of a DC network, as affected by the interconnection of EVCSs, is proposed for planning. An example of the planning of a DC network for about 40 EVCSs is used to evaluate the conclusions andto demonstrate how driving factors can be considered in the planning process by using the proposed reduced-order modal analysis method.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2020.2982431","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:YJ201654); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044431","DC network;EV;EV charging station;small-signal stability","Power system stability;Planning;Stability criteria;Analytical models;Network topology;Topology","","21","","26","IEEE","23 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, simplified linearized models of a DC network integrated with large EVCSs, which adopts series and parallel connections (SC-EVCS and PC-EVCS, respectively), are established. In this study, the control subsystem of each EVCS is demonstrated to have weak interaction with the filter subsystem and the DC network. Moreover, a method for designing proper parameters to ensure self-stability of the EVCS is proposed. Additionally, when multiple EVCSs are connected to the DC network, the interaction among the connected EVCSs may decrease the DC system stability. Therefore, the positive-net-damping stability criterion is used to analyze the small-signal stability of the DC system, confirming that the instability of the DC system is caused by two factors, the filter subsystem of the EVCS and the equivalent impedance of the DC network. Considering the restrictions on stability, the maximum number of connections of SC-EVCSs and PC-EVCSs should be limited in planning. Furthermore, the study theoretically proves that compared with PC-EVCS, SC-EVCS can service more EVCSs to the DC network while ensuring stability.

With EV parking lots included in its asset portfolio, a city can take advantage of the power stored in the parked EVs without major capital investments. In this article, we formulate the operation of an EV parking lot from the viewpoint of its owner (i.e., a city or a private entity). The lot works as a market aggregator with operational uncertainties stemming from: (i) random arrival and departure of vehicles, (ii) the SoC of EV batteries at the times of arrival and departure, and (iii) willingness of EV owners to participate. The risks from these uncertainties and market prices of ancillary services impact the bottom line of the lot owner’s revenue. For EV owners the excessive up and down cycles of battery is offset by discount offered by the lot owner.

To tackle this challenge, the system operators and planners have two primary options: 1) expanding system capacity and 2) implementing charging management programs. In this article, we consider an exclusive dc feeder for supplying multiple EV charging stations, connected to the main grid via the grid-tie converter. In addition, a two-stage coordination algorithm is proposed in which the EV charging stations’ daily quotas from the grid-tie converter capacity and their day-ahead scheduling plans are determined in the first stage. In this regard, the EV charging stations determine their profit curves, and then the local market operator (LMO) collects these curves and calculates the quotas by maximizing the total profit respecting the capacity constraint. Considering the calculated quotas, the EV charging stations determine and submit their day-ahead scheduling plans to the LMO. In the second stage, each EV charging station manages its real-time operation under the uncertainties of EV parking activities. To this end, the model predictive control (MPC) method is used to effectively handle model uncertainties. Furthermore, to encourage EV owners’ participation in the charging control program, the EV charging station’s profit is fairly distributed among EVs based on their provided flexibility. Finally, the simulation study is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model from the perspective of system operation and EV owners.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2024.3357217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10414177","EV charging management;grid-tie converter limitation;model predictive control (MPC);profit-sharing mechanism;two-stage algorithm","Electric vehicle charging;Uncertainty;Batteries;Distribution networks;Costs;State of charge;Privacy","","9","","30","IEEE","25 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For such a need, we consider several practical aspects of urban systems, such as voltage regulation cost and protection device upgrade resulting from the large integration of EVs. Notably, our diversified objective can reveal the trade-off between different factors in different cities worldwide. To understand the global optimum of large-scale analysis, we studied each feature to preserve the problem convexity. Our sensitivity analysis before and after convexification shows that our approach is not only universally applicable but also has a small approximation error for prioritizing the most urgent constraint in a specific setup.

Therefore, the well-suited multiple access control (MAC) protocol design for such event-driven data is an emerging research area. However, because the number of smart meters (communication nodes) involved in such a single SMN is much larger than those in today's local area networks, the traditional random access MAC protocol is unlikely to perform well.

As a type of distributed energy resource, electrical vehicles (EVs) are regarded as a promising solution to the problem. In this paper, a transactive real-time EV charging management scheme is proposed for the building energy management system (BEMS) of commercial buildings with PV on-site generation and EV charging services. Instead of direct EV charging control, the proposed EV charging management scheme applies a transactive energy concept-based approach to address real-time EV charging management. With the proposed scheme, the BEMS can schedule its net electricity exchange with the external grid under the uncertainties of PV generation and EV parking and maximize its profit in the realtime operation. Meanwhile, the EV owners need not provide the BEMS with further private information (such as future driving plans) but only their real-time charging requirements and preference setting of the response to the BEMS's pricing signal in the proposed scheme. As such, the BEMS as a charging service provider only requires the minimal necessary information from EV owners. The EV owners' charging requirements, preference setting of the response curves and their required reimbursements for the response are respected by the real-time charging management and their contributions to the demand response are reimbursed by the BEMS.

This paper focuses on the allocation of EVCS and capacitor installations in RDN by maximizing net present value (NPV), considering the reduction in energy losses and interruption costs.

However, the increased penetration rate of electric vehicles and expansion of variable renewable energy sources can accelerate the power demand and uncertainty in the power generation output. In this paper, power system analysis is performed through electric vehicle charging demand and wind power outputs prediction, and an electric vehicle charging decentralization algorithm is proposed to mitigate system congestion. In order to predict electric vehicle charging demand, the measurement data were analyzed, and random sampling was performed by applying the weight of charging frequency for each season and time. In addition, wind power outputs prediction was performed using the ARIMAX model. Input variables are wind power measurement data and additional explanatory variables (wind speed). Wind power outputs prediction error (absolute average error) is about 9.6%, which means that the prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm is high. A practical power system analysis was performed for the scenario in which electric vehicle charging is expected to be higher than the wind power generation due to the concentration of electric vehicle charging. The proposed algorithm can be used to analyze power system problems that may occur due to the concentration of electric vehicle charging demand in the future, and to prepare a method for decentralizing electric vehicle charging demand to establish a stable power system operation plan.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075072","Korea Electric Power Corporation(grant numbers:R18XA06-55); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9410546","Electric vehicle;charging station;wind generating resources;charging demand;wind power forecasting;security analysis","Electric vehicle charging;Wind power generation;Renewable energy sources;Time-frequency analysis;Power system stability;Power systems;Prediction algorithms","","12","","23","CCBY","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the division of carbon responsibilities for EVs is unclear, which seriously affects the long-term healthy development of carbon reduction strategies. Therefore, this article comprehensively considers EV charging scheduling and traffic trajectories and proposes a new joint optimization method for PDNs and EV tracks. Additionally, the method also takes into account the allocation of carbon emission responsibilities. Specifically, a three-layer iterative optimization framework is established. In the first layer, a carbon emission flow model is established based on the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) framework, and price signals reflecting the carbon responsibility of each node are obtained. Then, using these price signals, the second layer employs evolutionary game theory to determine the charging prices at different nodes. In the third layer, a two-objective track optimization model is proposed to minimize operation cost and maximize traffic flow, and the charging demand of each node is fed back to the first layer until the iteration converges. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is designed, driven by the Lagrangian function, the Bellman-Ford augmented path algorithm, and the Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow algorithm, to efficiently solve this problem. Numerical tests verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods in ensuring the safe and economical operation of PDNs and reducing carbon emissions.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2025.3570747","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFA1004600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62303371,U23A20650); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Foundation of Key Laboratory of Cleaner Intelligent Control on Coal and Electricity, Ministry of Education(grant numbers:CICCE202421); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11006119","Carbon emission flow tracing;electric vehicles (EVs);evolutionary game;joint optimization of distribution network and transportation network","Carbon dioxide;Transportation;Electric vehicle charging;Costs;Games;Distribution networks;Pricing;Load flow;Carbon;Resource management","","1","","26","IEEE","16 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, EV charging may also impose significant investment requirement for the power system that needs to be analyzed carefully including the capacity of the existing distribution network system, investments needed in solar PV together with battery storage and additional diesel capacity to meet the incremental demand from EVs. We explore an EV adoption scenario for Maldives for 2030 with 30% of all vehicles including two-wheelers that dominate the transport on the island under two different charging regimes: uncoordinated and optimized coordinated mode. The latter is achieved through a system wide optimization using a modified version of the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM) that optimizes charging load subject to a range of constraints on allowable timing for different categories of vehicles. If charging from the fleet is uncoordinated, a relatively small increase in energy requirement of 3.1% due to EV may lead to a 26.1% increase in generation capacity requirement and hence 15.7% additional investment. While the optimized charging regime helps to drastically cut down on generation capacity requirements to just 1.8% increase and also considerably eases feeder loading, it may also lead to higher emissions as more EV load during off-peak hours lead to an increase in diesel-based generation. We have therefore explored an additional scenario wherein the annual emissions from the power sector are constrained to the baseline (“No EV”) scenario. The analysis shows the importance of focused modeling analysis to understand the ramifications of EV load impact on the power system including significant increase in generation capacity and potential increase in power sector emissions in a fossil-fuel dominated system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530709","Electric vehicles;power system optimization;least-cost planning;distribution network","Power systems;Planning;Investment;Costs;Transportation;Renewable energy sources;Load modeling","","30","","71","CCBY","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In modern electric power systems, the integration of EVCS and DG must be carefully planned. Inappropriate sizing and location of EVCS can cause network overload, increase power losses, and allow for voltage variations outside the standard. This study adopts a reference distribution network that is representative of a typical business distribution network in a metropolitan city in Indonesia. To resolve the issue of determining the size and location of EVCS, the hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm algorithm (HGAMSSA) optimization method with multi-objective function is implemented. There are three scenarios used when determining the size and placement of EVCS. In the first scenario, the EVCS comprises chargers at levels 1, 2, and 3, with DG integration. In the second scenario, EVCS is comprised of level 2 and level 3, with DG integration. While in the third scenario, EVCS only consists of level 3 chargers with DG integration. The simulation results indicate that network utilization can be optimized at 79.00%, 75.53%, and 76.37% when electric cars (EV) operate in grid to vehicle (G2V) mode, compared to a base load of 29.46%. In vehicle to grid (V2G) mode, the energy supplied by the electric vehicle (EV) via the EVCS is 0.91 MWh.

This paper addresses the sizing (number of chargers and waiting spaces) problem of fast charging stations and presents an optimal planning solution based on an explicit temporal-state of charge characterization of PEV fast charging demand. The characteristics of PEV charging demand are derived through a vehicle travel behavior analysis using available statistics. The PEV dynamics in charging stations is modelled with a Markov chain and queuing theory. As a result, the optimal number of chargers and waiting spaces in fast charging stations can be jointly determined to maximize expected operator profits, considering profit of charging service, penalty of waiting and rejection, as well as maintenance cost of idle facilities.

Specifically, it focuses on optimizing charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles while managing constrained grid capacity. Businesses’ increasing adoption of mid-size to heavy EV fleets has created a significant surge in electricity demand, often exceeding the local grid’s ability to support charging at vehicles’ base locations. Supply chain constraints that hinder timely infrastructure upgrades exacerbate this mismatch between demand and capacity. We present an optimization model for EV fleet charging location assignment that tackles this issue. Our approach considers multiple commercial fleet operators, each with a set of base locations for their vehicles. The model accounts for limited charging capacity at these bases and proposes strategically placing charging hubs in areas with excess grid capacity. We incorporate a flexible incentive framework into our model to encourage the use of these hubs and other non-base charging locations. The primary objective of this study is to optimize the allocation of charging resources for commercial EV fleets and to maintain grid stability in the face of rapidly growing demand. Our model integrates fleet operational constraints, grid limitations, and incentive structures to provide a comprehensive solution that benefits fleet operators and utility providers. To validate our approach, we perform a series of computational experiments based on realistic data from the city of San Antonio, TX, a major urban center in Texas.

To accommodate the increasing number of EVs, the co-planning of electrical distribution networks and the charging infrastructure, such as fast-charging stations (FCSs), becomes an emergent task. Both the charging demand of EVs and the stability of the electricity network should be satisfied. In this paper, we proposed a data-driven agent-based planning strategy for FCSs. Different from the conventional planning strategy, we utilized machine learning tools to consider EV behaviors at the microscopic level in a planning problem. First, a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process of EVs is established, and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is utilized to learn the charging and driving decisions of EVs under different transportation network typologies and FCSs planning schemes. Second, a data-driven agent-based traffic assignment model (DA-TAM) is proposed to aggregate the atomic behaviors of EVs, which can present the sensitivity of the traffic flow and EV charging demand to the FCS planning schemes. Third, the DA-TAM is adapted to the proposed planning model to ensure the quality of service and prevent unbalanced traffic flow. Through the proposed method, microscopic behaviors of EVs can be reflected, and the impact of the planning scheme on the traffic condition can be revealed. The proposed methodologies are verified in the case studies.

The dramatic load reduction at limited period not only leads to security problem of power system due to the deficiency of downward reserve in generation side, but also forces the thermal units to operate in the extremely uneconomical deep peak regulation (DPR) state. To address this issue, a coordinated optimization strategy considering nighttime DPR state of units and uncertain EV demand response (DR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, unlike traditional studies, a detailed unit commitment (UC) model considering life loss and oil cost is established in this paper. After that, on the basis of elastic pricing method and day-ahead contract, price-based demand response (PDR) and incentive-based demand response (IDR) model are proposed to avoid units operating in the DPR state. The uncertainty of both IDR and PDR progress are considered as a whole in the form of opportunity constrain, and then transformed into deterministic linear constraints for solving by adopting sequence operations.

Second, to analyze the effects of voltage, the same arithmetic methods are extended to perform power flow calculation. Thirdly, interval undervoltage probability (IUP) is introduced to evaluate the HC of the EVs. Subsequently, a voltage violation index (VVI) is introduced, and an EV HC evaluation method is proposed, assisting in the flexible operation of the network based on VVI.

This requires the system operators to manage available resources and utilize suitable risk management tools to control and study uncertainties and their potential consequences. This paper proposes an uncertainty-based optimization framework based on the robust optimization and scenario methodology for optimal sizing and siting of electrical vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The proposed model seeks to take advantage of the flexibility introduced by EVCSs and gain financial profit for the operator of the power distribution system through reducing power losses and offering services to electricity markets. To handle the uncertainties posed by different resources, two risk measures are employed simultaneously. The uncertainty originating from the state of charge (SOC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is addressed through stochastic programming, while the robust optimization method (ROM) enables the operator of the power distribution system to be informed of the consequences of uncertainty in electricity load. Therefore, appropriate strategies can be taken to tackle the uncertainties while keeping the system operation stable and gaining financial profit. Thus, three strategies are studied in the proposed model as follows: risk-neutral, risk-averse, and risk-taker. In addition, the non-linear terms in power flow modeling were linearized through a set of linear functions which transforms the proposed model to a MILP problem. The IEEE 33-bus test system under different levels of load uncertainty and considering the uncertainty in SOC of EVs is utilized to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Inappropriate installation of EV charging stations (EVCS) degrades the distribution network’s power quality, affecting smooth functioning. This article proposes a novel strategy for properly allocating EVCS in a distribution system by analyzing the impact of power quality issues, namely harmonics and loss of life of the distribution transformer. The analysis is carried out in a standard IEEE-33 bus radial distribution system and a real-time distribution system in Kerala, India. The impact of power quality issues is highlighted by perceiving the effect of slow/moderate and fast chargers in the system under study. The results substantiate the potency of the reliability index (RI) strategy. The severity level for planning the charging station (CS) in numerous buses in the distribution network without infrastructural upgrades is determined by employing a modified novel EV placement index (EVPI m ). The novelty of the index lies in the fact that it incorporates all of the operational parameters with a specific focus on the power quality issues in the distribution network. The severity level of the EVPI m  maintains the power quality without increasing the rating of the components used or any infrastructural upgrades.

Electric vehicles (EVs) with rechargeable batteries can be powered by external sources of electricity from the grid, and thus charging scheduling that guides low-battery EVs to charging services is significant for service quality improvement of EV drivers. The revolution of communications and data analytics driven by massive data in smart grid brings many challenges as well as chances for EV charging scheduling, and how to schedule EV charging in a smart and resilient way has inevitably become a crucial problem. Toward this end, we in this paper leverage the techniques of software defined networking and vehicular edge computing to investigate a joint problem of fast charging station selection and EV route planning. Our objective is to minimize the total overhead from users' perspective, including time and charging fares in the whole process, considering charging availability and electricity price fluctuation. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based solution is proposed to determine an optimal charging scheduling policy for low-battery EVs. Besides, in response to dynamic EV charging, we further develop a resilient EV charging strategy based on incremental update, with EV drivers' user experience being well considered. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed DRL-based solution obtains near-optimal EV charging overhead with good adaptivity, and the solution with incremental update achieves much higher computation efficiency than conventional game-theoretical method in dynamic EV charging.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2951966","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801360,61771374,61771373,61601357); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:310201905200001,3102019PY005,JB181506,JB181507,JB181508); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8892573","Smart grid;electric vehicle;charging scheduling;vehicular edge computing;deep reinforcement learning","Electric vehicle charging;Processor scheduling;Edge computing;Dynamic scheduling;Batteries;Vehicle dynamics","","160","","40","IEEE","6 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EVs can serve either as a load or storage, presenting a dual-faceted challenge to power system planning and operation. As a result, there is a growing need for comprehensive reliability assessment in the presence of EVs. This paper proposes improved reliability assessment frameworks for systems with large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) operating in battery exchange (BE) and plug-in modes. Initially, a reliability model for BE electric vehicles (BEVs) is formulated using a time-series aggregated EV user load profile, BE station operation strategy, and off-peak battery exchange mode of BEVs. Additionally, a random-sampling-based operational algorithm is developed for plug-in EVs (PEVs), considering their charging, discharging, and grid support modes. A composite reliability assessment framework is then developed, incorporating an optimization model that accounts for the aggregated operations of BEVs and PEVs. The effect of EVs on the system reliability is assessed using the mixed-timing sequential Monte Carlo simulation on the IEEE RTS-79 and the RTS-GMLC systems. Simulation results show that up to 18% improvement in reliability indices is achieved with a 15% penetration of BEVs operating in off-peak mode. Also, the same penetration of PEVs with grid-support modes yields up to 14% improvement in system reliability. Finally, the impacts of BEV and PEV integration on the loading and reliability of transmission lines and power transformers are analyzed.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2025.3544559","U.S. Department of Energy; Office of Science; Office of Electricity(grant numbers:DE-SC0023422); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10899897","Battery exchange mode;controlled charging;electric vehicles;plug-in mode;reliability","Reliability;Power system reliability;Batteries;Load modeling;Power transmission lines;Power transformers;Optimization;Loading;Vectors;Planning","","","","45","IEEE","24 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Likewise, next generation plug-in vehicles, which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, referred to as gridable vehicles (GVs) by the authors, can reduce emissions from the transportation sector. GVs can be used as loads, energy sources (small portable power plants) and energy storage units in a smart grid integrated with renewable energy sources. However, uncertainty surrounds the controllability of GVs. Forecasted load is used in unit commitment (UC); however, the actual load usually differs from the forecasted one. Thus, UC with plug-in vehicles under uncertainty in a smart grid is very complex considering smart charging and discharging to and from various energy sources and loads to reduce both cost and emissions. A set of valid scenarios is considered for the uncertainties of wind and solar energy sources, load and GVs.

There is also significant increase in load that may come in the form of electric vehicles (EV) charging and hydrogen requirement for decarbonization of other sectors. While there is a growing literature around long-term decarbonization strategies, there is still ample room for a practical methodology to rigorously test capacity plans to include a range of options inter alia re- optimization of the mix of renewable technologies, better coordination of the (EV) load from a system perspective, or augmenting the plan with battery energy storage (BESS) and hydrogen. This paper presents our research on EV load and green hydrogen modeling including how they can be integrated into long-term electricity models. We also present a methodology that allows planners to undertake a rigorous assessment that can be readily implemented using the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM). The application of the model is illustrated through a case study for Turkey (Türkiye) for 2050. The case study shows how an incumbent policy-driven capacity plan for 2050 that included 33% contribution from variable renewable energy (VRE) may be prone to unserved energy risk during winter months due to seasonal variability of VRE. The analysis goes on to demonstrate how the plan can be reinforced with additional peaking gas turbines, re- optimization of wind and solar, BESS and hydrogen.

This paper addresses the NE seeking problem for a class of aggregative games with general directed communication graphs. To achieve this objective, two new kinds of distributed discrete-time NE seeking algorithms are developed for aggregative games over fixed digraphs and time-varying digraphs, respectively. In particular, motivated by the heavy-ball method in optimization studies, a momentum term is introduced to the update law of the players’ actions and it is numerically verified that this momentum term accelerates the convergence of the proposed algorithms. For both strongly connected fixed graph and  $B$ -strongly connected time-varying graph, it is theoretically proved that the actions of players will converge to the NE of aggregative games for the case of decreasing step-size implemented by the proposed NE seeking algorithms if the cost functions and the aggregation of players satisfy some certain conditions.

To fight this environmental issue associated with vehicle transmission, almost every nation is promoting electric vehicles (EV). In this article, a novel method for developing a sliding mode maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller for photovoltaic (PV) systems operating in rapidly varying atmospheric circumstances is put forward. Further, the standard Perturb and observe (Pb&O) algorithm’s variable step is driven by the best sliding mode controller (SLMC) gains, which are determined using the Genetic Algorithm (GAO).

The main contribution of this study is to enhance the created controller’s tracking performance to reach the maximum power point (MPP) with negligible oscillation, low overshoot, minimum ripple, and excellent speed in conditions of air turbulence that change quickly, as well as ensure continuity in supply to the EV. Furthermore, the developed system as a whole shows good efficacy compared with other existing systems reviewed in the literature.

However, a major challenge in EV charging is optimal day-ahead charging planning under time-varying conditions, such as fluctuating charging prices and traffic conditions. Additionally, these conditions can lead to uncertain energy consumption while driving an EV. Predicting the energy consumption of an electric vehicle is complicated because it is influenced by more factors than a typical battery, such as driving habits and traffic conditions. This paper proposes an optimal EV charging planning strategy using an artificial intelligence-based energy consumption prediction model to address this problem. The energy consumption prediction model, based on long short-term memory (LSTM), was developed and validated against other artificial intelligence models. The LSTM-based model uses real-time training, making it suitable for uncertain scenarios encountered by EVs. The predicted results and traffic information are considered as weight factors in solving the EV charging planning and routing optimization problem. The optimization problem is formulated as mixed integer linear programming. Simulation studies under various driving and traffic conditions validate the proposed optimal charging planning and routing method. Since travel time can vary according to driving characteristics and traffic conditions over the same driving distance, the results confirm that the proposed method can predict energy consumption more accurately than other methods. It also selects routes with lower energy consumption relative to total driving time and provides stable operation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3438993","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2023R1A2C2005090) and the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea(grant numbers:20214000000820); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10623484","Electrical vehicle;electrical vehicle charging planning;SOC forecasting;real-time training;long short-term memory;EV powertrain model","Energy consumption;Planning;Predictive models;Routing;Real-time systems;Batteries;Uncertainty;Electric vehicle charging;Long short term memory;Rail transportation;Low carbon economy","","4","","81","CCBYNCND","5 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, PKC comes with its own problems in terms of certificate management. Specifically, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) need to be maintained and distributed to the smart meters (SMs) in order to ensure security of the communications. The size of CRLs may grow over time and eventually may introduce additional delay, bandwidth, and storage overhead when various applications are run on SG. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for creating customized CRLs with reduced size for IEEE 802.11s-based advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Rather than maintaining a huge-size single CRL that introduces unnecessary search time and storage, the idea is to cluster/group SMs within the AMI network and create CRLs based on these groups. The grouping is mainly done in such a way that they bring together the SMs that will be very likely to communicate so that the CRLs will be kept local to that group. To this end, we propose two novel grouping algorithms. The first algorithm is a bottom-up approach, which is based on the existing routes from the SMs to the gateway. Since the SMs will be sending their data to the gateway through the nodes on the route, this forms a natural grouping. The second approach is a top-down recursive approach, which considers the minimum spanning tree of the network and then divides it into smaller subtrees. Via grouping, the length of the CRL for each SM and the corresponding distribution overhead can be reduced significantly. Simulation results have shown that our approach can maintain a balance between the size of the CRL and the number of signatures generated by CAs while guaranteeing security of the communications.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2390131","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1318872); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024936","Certificate revocations;grouping schemes;public key cryptography;security;smart grid;Certificate revocations;grouping schemes;public key cryptography;security;smart grid","Logic gates;Security;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Wireless communication;Relays;Smart grids","","24","","21","IEEE","28 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although EVs do not produce tailpipe emissions, their widespread adoption may impose significant pressure on the decarbonization of the power system—a critical aspect often overlooked in planning and policy-making. Moreover, the actual environmental benefits of EVs depend on the source of electricity used for charging. Considering the power demand induced by EV charging, we develop a continuous-time dynamic model for the optimal planning of simultaneous EV adoption and the integration of renewable energy sources into the power system. The interactions between competing entities, such as EVs versus legacy vehicles, and renewable versus conventional energy sources, are incorporated into our mathematical model based on the Lotka-Volterra equations. We formulate an optimal control problem to determine planning policies for EV subsidies, infrastructure investment, and the rates of renewable integration and fossil fuel retirement. The goal is to achieve a desired EV market penetration rate (MPR) while enabling the smooth integration of renewables. The nonlinear optimal control problem is solved using the Pontryagin minimum principle.

Unlike the conventionally used orthogonal vector model, in this work, phase angle vector model together with a simple to tune phase-locked loop (PLL) has been considered for the LKF implementation. DC-link voltage regulation and charging of the DC-link capacitor has been obtained by proposing a Luenberger observer-based super twisting sliding mode control (ST-SMC), which has fast dynamic response and lower voltage ripples compared to similar other existing control methods. This results in significant reduction in size, cost and loss together with lifetime enhancement of the DC-link capacitor. Rigorous sensitivity analysis is conducted to analyze the robustness of the developed method. The proposed control technique achieves fast response time and satisfy the harmonic requirements as specified in the IEEE Std. 519 under various grid and load disturbances.

The results indicate that controlled charging of EVs leads to significant reduction of overloaded network components that have to be replaced, but the impact varies per network level. Overall, in the uncontrolled charging scenarios roughly two times more replacements are needed compared to the controlled charging scenario. Furthermore, it was shown that for the controlled charging scenario the overall reduction in net present value due to energy losses and the replacement of overloaded network components is approximately 20% in comparison with the uncontrolled charging scenario.

An improved income approach (IIA) is then developed to well capture the heterogeneity of EV users’ charging behavior. The waiting cost of EV users is estimated by their value of time (VOT), which helps them to make a better choice between TMC and FC. To solve the optimal model easily, the big-M method is applied to linearize and convert the nonlinear problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Meanwhile, the analytical target cascading (ATC) technique is employed to realize the data exchange process between the upper and lower layers.

This paper proposes two adequacy metrics to quantify the maximum permissible EV loads for a power system without deteriorating its reliability and the required improvements to power systems to accommodate high penetrations of EVs, which are defined as follows: 1) extra effective available energy for EVs' charging (EEAE-EVs) and 2) extra effective required generation to accommodate EVs (EERG-EVs). The EEAE-EVs provides a measure for the maximum amount of EV loads that a power system can accommodate without adding new generation while maintaining its reliability. The EERG-EVs provides a measure to the minimum amount of new generation that is needed to restore the reliability level of a power system if the load of EVs exceeds the maximum permissible load of the system. These metrics provide a decision aid to power system planners and operators on when and how to perform generation expansion. The importance of the proposed metrics is demonstrated on the IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE RTS) with real EV charging data. The sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is used in evaluating the well known power system reliability indices, the EEAE-EVs, and the EERG-EVs. The results show that a power system can accommodate EV loads without deteriorating its reliability as long as EV loads do not exceed the EEAE-EVs of the system. For the IEEE RTS, the EERG-EVs shows that the amount of the required generation to maintain system reliability is about half of the added EV loads from 330-660 MW.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2019.2914877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705332","Adequacy assessment;effective capacity;electric vehicles;extra generation required;load profile","Power system reliability;Reliability;Power measurement;Maintenance engineering;Electric vehicles","","26","","37","IEEE","3 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Game theory is often used to provide a new solution for the optimal decision-making among multi-stakeholders. As a dynamic game, differential game can describe the dynamic changes of time-sharing electricity price (TOU price) about power grid and charging power about EV in real time. Considering the problem of “peak on top of peak” caused by a large number of electric vehicles' disordered charging, this paper makes the dispatching strategy of EVs entering the grid based on the TOU price, and establishes a dynamic differential game model for the power grid and EV decision makers. The model is solved by taking the TOU price of power grid and the charging power of EV as the strategy, and smoothing the peak valley difference of power grid and minimizes the charging cost of EV as the goal. In the end, DR for optimizing power grid load and reducing user's low cost is adopted to simulate the proposed model. The simulation results show that the peak-valley difference rate of the optimized power grid is reduced by 6.93%, and the cost of EV users is reduced by 71.52%.

First, the Monte Carlo sampling method is used to analyze the charging load demands of a large number of EVs. Next, we construct a multi-objective optimization scheduling model for the active distribution network. This model integrates the charging demands of EVs with the operating constraints of the distribution network. To tackle the multi-objective optimization problem, we propose the NSGAII-NDAX algorithm. Additionally, we employ a fuzzy theory-based method to select the Pareto optimal solution set, addressing the challenge of decision-making complexity posed by the large size and information-rich content of the optimal solution set.

A generalized generation distribution factor (GGDF) for the pre-and post-contingency selection technique is applied based on the DC power flow model to address the uncertain parameters. A line outage distribution factors (LODF) method is proposed for the post-contingency constraints to reduce the computational burden due to many scenarios and N-k line outages.

This paper focuses on the scheduling of PEVs charging process among different charging stations and each station can be supplied by both renewable energy generators and a distribution network. The distribution network also powers some uncontrollable loads. In order to minimize the on-grid energy cost with local renewable energy and non-ideal storage while avoiding the overload risk of the distribution network, an online algorithm consisting of scheduling the charging of PEVs and energy management of charging stations is developed based on Lyapunov optimization and Lagrange dual decomposition techniques. The algorithm can satisfy the random charging requests from PEVs with provable performance.

However, the rapid deployment of EVs largely depends on the coordinated and fast expansion of EV charging stations (EVCSs). The integration of EVCSs in the modern distribution network characterized by increased penetration of randomly distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems is challenging as they can lead to excessive power losses and voltage deviations beyond acceptable limits. In this paper, a hybrid bacterial foraging optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization (BFOA-PSO) technique is proposed for the optimal placement of EVCSs into the distribution network with high penetration of randomly distributed rooftop PV systems. The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective problem minimizing active and reactive power losses, average voltage deviation index, and maximizing voltage stability index. The IEEE 69 node distribution network is used as the case network. The simulation is done using MATLAB to integrate the EVCSs in five cases of randomly sized and placed PV systems in the distribution network. For all five cases, a minimal increase in power losses is recorded with minor changes in the voltage deviation and stability indices due to the placement of the EVCSs. But for the voltages of nodes 29 to 48, the other node voltages remain unchanged upon placement of the EVCSs. The largest increase in power losses due to the EVCSs being brought into the network with PVs was noticed in case 3 (from 142.27kW, and 62.90kVar to 147.65kW, and 72.48kVar).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3112847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9537756","Electric vehicle;charging station;photovoltaic;hybrid BFOA-PSO;optimal placement","Distribution networks;Voltage;Power system stability;Optimization;Indexes;Stability criteria;Power demand","","69","","40","CCBY","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we develop a distributed EV charging mechanism (D-EVCM) where each EV possesses some information, such as the charging probabilities of other EVs, electricity price, current energy level, and expected departure time. Based on the information, an EV periodically decides whether to charge its battery in a distributed manner. To minimize the average charging cost of EV while avoiding the situation where an EV departs from a charging station with insufficient energy level, a constrained stochastic game model is formulated and its solution is obtained using a best response dynamics-based algorithm.

To improve the intermittency caused by renewables and to increase the grid flexibility, grid integrated Energy Storage Units (ESUs) are proposed as the promising solution in the literature. However, considering the investment cost, ESUs are optimally placed by satisfying the network electrical constraints. On the other hand, consideration of environmental impacts and other practical constraints are also equally important. Therefore, in this article, on top of grid performance parameters, realistic parameters that may affect the location and its size such as (1) environmental impact, (2) land requirement & its associated cost for ESU installation and (3) renewable purchase obligation are formulated in the objective function. Decision making on ESU installation is a planning activity, which follows uncertainty. Consequently, it is essential to model the uncertainty parameters into the objective function, for better planning.

Issues such as node overvoltage and frequency fluctuations should be addressed to ensure power quality while maximizing charging quality-of-service (QoS) for EV users. This challenge is particularly crucial for fast-charging events that have more flexible demands. Charging priority has traditionally been used to determine an EV charging scheme, including waiting time, arrival order, and other factors. However, the scheduling potential predicted from the vehicle side has not been fully considered in the priority establishment when determining real-time operation. To address this gap, a bilevel framework is proposed for a coordinated charging scheme at the fast-charging station that factors in demand-based priority. The framework considers available charging power allocation at different priority levels and optimizes the charging scheme under the same priority level based on three real-time QoS objectives. This approach can improve the average charging QoS for EV users compared to traditional algorithms without considering the demand priority. In robustness evaluation, the QoS of scheduled charging events can reach 86.9% (median) of the optimal solution, and the range of fluctuations in different trials is relatively more stable.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2023.3334809","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB2403900); Beijing Nova Program(grant numbers:20220484105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324833","Coordinated charging;demand-based priority;electric vehicle (EV);power quality","State of charge;Planning;Electric vehicle charging;Real-time systems;Quality of service;Transportation;Behavioral sciences","","17","","44","IEEE","21 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we develop an electric vehicle (EV) charging management system comprised of offline EVSEs based on a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) system. To enable offline peer-to-peer (P2P) authentication between the user’s device (UD) and EVSE stations, we use a distributed certificate management based on Shamir’s algorithm and blind signing approach using the ring signature. We introduce extended FBA for charge point operator (FBA-CPO) systems and include explicit operational functions to ensure the ledger dissemination and scalability of the network. We specifically employ a pre-authorized mechanism for deferral vouchers using a pre-signed and weighted signing method. In the FBA-CPO network, each charger records all transactions on a local ledger and publicly publishes ledgers through random UD nodes. Under a generalization of the property of the federated quorum system, the proposed approach could provide a reliable network centrality with or without offline EVSEs. Eventually, we examined the performance of the proposed model using a system of real devices and their digital twins. Results show the FBA-CPO satisfies all functional and cross-cutting requirements for a consistent transnational mechanism.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2023.3307679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227349","EVSE;CPO;FBA;DLT;blockchain","Peer-to-peer computing;Internet of Things;Authentication;Trustless services;Surveys;Smart cities;Scalability;Blockchains","","10","","71","IEEE","23 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

PEVs are mobile and distributed devices with deferrable options for the supply/utilization of energy at various times and locations. The increased utilization of PEVs, which consume electricity rather than fossil fuel for driving, offers unique economic and environmental opportunities, and brings out new challenges to electric power system operation and planning. The storage capability of PEVs could help power systems mitigate the variability of renewable energy sources and reduce grid operation costs. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables PEVs to have bi-directional power flows once they are connected to the grid, i.e., they can either inject power to, and draw power from, the grid which adds further complexity to power system operations. PEVs signify customers' random behavior when considering their driving patterns, locational energy requirements, topological grid interconnections, and other constraints imposed by the consumers.

Through simulations, the correctness of our analysis is validated and the payoff of the EVCSs is examined for various environments. Our results reveal that although the payoff of the EVCSs is generally small, it is higher than when the electricity from the RPGs is directly sold to the power grid. We also find that the payoff of the EVCSs is significantly affected by the elasticity of the electricity demand of the EVs.

The spatial-temporal allocation of EV is conventionally obtained through a simulation procedure using traffic topology data, which is not suitable for the regions lacking such information. This model converts the problem of travel distance to travel duration so that the requirement of network geographic information can be avoided. Static EV parameters, EV spatial-temporal moving parameters and system charging model parameters are treated as the deterministic factors for the charging demand allocation. A stochastic travel route simulation procedure, which relies purely on statistical data of traffic flow, is also developed to obtain the EV moving parameters by adopting the traffic property information. The designed procedure derives travel time parameters from the vehicle dynamic-location-property (DLP) model and the travel time probability distribution. The DLP model is established using the traffic property matrix and the regional origin-destination matrix. A simple case is presented to illustrate the result of stochastic travel route simulation.

This coordination is possible due to the recent advances in smart grid technologies. The case of a load-serving entity (LSE) that owns thermal and wind plants, and is obligated to serve a load with a significant number of electric vehicles (EVs) is investigated. The problem of energy trading in coordination with V2G services is formulated as a mixed-integer stochastic linear program.

Due to their extensive consumption, another driving force behind the search for alternatives is the fast depletion of fossil fuels, oil, and natural gas. Consequently, Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) have recently been the subject of substantial research to tackle the dual problems of harmful emissions and resource depletion. This research attempts to develop a novel barrier function-based adaptive sliding mode controller (BFASMC) for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of electric Vehicle (EV). The HESS comprises a fuel cell (FC), battery, supercapacitor (SC), and photovoltaic (PV). The FC serves as a primary source, while the others are auxiliary sources.

One way to address these challenges is to use storage devices that can store surplus energy from RESs and discharge the energy back to the grid when needed. Researchers have recently introduced the idea to use electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, which are called “gridable vehicles” (GVs), as storage devices in the smart grid. Using GVs as loads is well accepted, but as sources, they disrupt system reliability if insufficient GVs are available for discharging when needed. An availability planning model is thus required to address this issue. GV owners' concern over battery lifetime reductions is another issue that impedes the required participation rates for GVs in vehicle-to-grid discharge programs. In this paper, we present an intelligent smart grid system model, which mitigates real-time unavailability of GV sources via an availability planning model. We also propose a GV selection model that prevents GV batteries from premature expiry due to their vehicle-to-grid operations. Simulation results confirm that our proposed models maintain better overall reliability and increase average battery lifetime by up to 3.5 years compared with existing vehicle-to-grid models.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2294734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698288","Battery lifetime;gridable vehicles (GVs);participation rate;smart grid;system reliability;vehicle-to-grid;Battery lifetime;gridable vehicles (GVs);participation rate;smart grid;system reliability;vehicle-to-grid","Batteries;Vehicles;Real-time systems;Discharges (electric);Smart grids;Availability","","27","","19","IEEE","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the substantial charging load brings challenging issues to the power grid. Modern technological advances and the huge number of high-rise buildings have promoted the development of distributed energy resources, such as building integrated/mounted wind turbines. The issue to coordinate EV charging with locally generated wind power of buildings can potentially reduce the impacts of EV charging demand on the power grid. As a result, this paper investigates this important problem and three contributions are made. First, the real-time scheduling of EV charging is addressed in a centralized framework based on the ideas of model predictive control, which incorporates the volatile wind power supply of buildings and the random daily driving cycles of EVs among different buildings. Second, an EV-based decentralized charging algorithm (EBDC) is developed to overcome the difficulties due to: 1) the possible lack of global information regarding the charging requirements of all EVs and 2) the computational burden with the increasing number of EVs. Third, we prove that the EBDC method can converge to the optimal solution of the centralized problem over each planning horizon. Moreover, the performance of the EBDC method is assessed through numeric comparisons with an optimal and two heuristic charging strategies (i.e., myopic and greedy). The results demonstrate that the EBDC method can achieve a satisfactory performance in improving the scalability and the balance between the EV charging demand and wind power supply of buildings. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the challenging problem due to the substantial charging load of electric vehicles (EVs) on the power grid. Nowadays, modern technological advances and the rapid increase of high-rise buildings have promoted the development of building integrated/mounted wind turbines. As the EVs are usually parked in buildings for a large proportion of time every day, the issue to best utilize locally generated wind power of buildings to suffice EV travelling requirements shows vital significance in reducing their dependence on the power grid. However, there exist two main challenges including: 1) the multiple uncertainties regarding the uncertain wind power generation and the random driving behaviors of EVs and 2) the scalability of the solution method. To tackle the first challenge, the idea of model predictive control is introduced to make charging decisions at each stage based on a short-term prediction of the on-site wind power and the current collection of EVs parked there. To consider the scalability and overcome the lack of global charging information of all EVs in practical deployment, an iterative EV-based decentralized charging algorithm (EBDC) is derived, in which each EV can dynamically update its own charging decisions according to a dynamic charging “price” announced by the buildings. Alternatively, the buildings dynamically adjust the charging “price” to motivate the EVs to get charged during the time periods with sufficient wind power supply. Numeric results demonstrate that the EBDC method is scalable and performs well in improving the balance between the EV charging demand and the wind power supply of buildings.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2018.2856908","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0901900,2017YFC0704100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673229,61174072,61222302,91224008,61221063,61403429,61621062,U1301254); 111 International Collaboration Project of China(grant numbers:B06002); Program for New Star of Science and Technology in Beijing(grant numbers:xx2014B056); Belgium Science Policy Office(grant numbers:FPM2015/ZKD0579); ISP/13/05TS from the University of Leuven; Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute Research Start-Up Funding; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8467498","Building integrated/mounted wind power;decentralized charging algorithm;electric vehicles (EVs);model predictive control (MPC)","Buildings;Wind power generation;Electric vehicle charging;Planning;Scalability;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms","","93","","55","OAPA","18 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the number of EVs increases in a market, EV charging requires significantly more electricity use and charging strategies could have a significant impact on the peak load and electricity demand in the power system, as well as the electricity bill for each household. The purpose of this paper is to develop a model to find a user-specific optimal EV charging strategy using actual data of users' behavior patterns in daily life. Toward this end, we deduce the time when each user utilizes electrical appliances and drives an EV based on actual user behavior data. The daily electricity consumption of a household by time is then calculated according to three different charging strategies. Comparing these results, we can obtain the optimal charging strategy for users to minimize their electricity bills. As a result of a simulation, it is found that, when each user follows her optimal charging strategy, the total electricity bill can be decreased by 35% and the peak-to-average ratio by 12% compared to when every user's charging is uncontrolled. The results show that the charging EVs according to the optimal strategy obtained by our model would significantly affect not only the user's electricity bill but also the whole power grid system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3090437","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Ministry of Science, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and Future Planning(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1A2B2005894); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459743","Optimal charging strategy;electric vehicles;electricity consumption;behavioral pattern;simulation","Electric vehicle charging;Home appliances;Power systems;Load modeling;Electrical products;Data models;Optimization","","13","","37","CCBY","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work comprises two main parts: representing plugin behaviors through customer segmentation and optimal charger allocation in community distribution networks. Customer segmentation is conducted using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, with EV adoption features selected based on their importance scores using regional EV availability. Primary plugin behaviors, based on Australian contexts, consider arrival time, charger preferences, driving patterns, and initial state of charge, while secondary behaviors, such as plugin intervals and energy needs, are modeled using probabilistic simulations. Utilizing secondary plugin variables, this research employs a two-stage multi-objective optimization approach to find optimal locations and sizes of community chargers in the IEEE-33 bus system coupled with a road network.

VPL reduces costs by using alternative resources instead of traditional grid reinforcement, ensuring stable power system operation amid growing renewable energy and demand. EV patterns are analyzed and separated into scheduling and routing. EV routing (EVR) increases power system hosting capacity and reduces photovoltaic (PV) curtailment while minimizing travel time for EV users. This approach highlights the synergy between power and transportation networks, providing a sustainable solution to minimize power system expansions through EV as NWA resources.

Different approaches of effort, among which battery swapping and fast charging are the two most well studied, have been made to solve the tradeoff problem between the battery charging speed and battery lifetime. There has been considerable debate over development strategy between charging and battery swapping. In passenger vehicles, the EV charging mode seems to dominate. But, does it mean that the battery swap mode is a dead-end? The answer should be “No”. There are use cases showing that battery swap can have great potentials for some particular uses, such as taxis and buses. This paper uses Monte Carlo simulations of vehicle behaviors to compare the service capacities and earnings of EV charging and battery swapping for both taxi and bus fleets. Stochastic models of taxis, buses, charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping systems are set up. Subsequently, service capacities of the EVSE are compared. The impact of factors on the service capacity, such as the size of the vehicle's battery, vehicle's moving speed, the power of the CS, and the price of the swapping service is investigated. Finally, possible reasons of today's less prevalence of battery swapping stations are discussed. The results of the analysis, which can be helpful to policymakers and industry investors, show that with same service capacity, an EV battery swapping station could provide significantly more financial and social benefits for the vehicle operators and EVSE service providers than that of an EV CS.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2018.2796498","SGCC Scientific and Technology Research Project(grant numbers:SGRIJSJSKF(2016)820); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8265183","Battery swapping;electric vehicle (EV);electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE);Monte Carlo simulation;smart grid","Batteries;Public transportation;Stochastic processes;Monte Carlo methods","","193","","23","IEEE","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rural communities face unique challenges, including low EV ownership rates, uncertain charging demand, grid capacity constraints, and limited private investment incentives. Case studies highlight successful rural charging initiatives, such as installations in National Parks, gateway communities, and Tribal Nations, including off-grid solar-powered solutions and charging stations powering electric shuttles. The article pinpoints the critical role of resilient charging infrastructure in emergency preparedness, particularly in hazard-prone areas where charger access is necessary for evacuation and disaster response. Strategies for building rural charging networks include strategic corridor placement, grid readiness assessments, colocation with existing services, universal design, and integration with renewable energy and storage. Accounting for technical, economic, and behavioral considerations, rural EV charging station location should rely on data-driven, place-based planning frameworks that address rural needs rather than replicating urban models.

Due to the stochastic nature of RES generation and electric vehicles (EVs), risky operational challenges might impact the grid. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective planning framework to optimally allocate EVCSs in conjunction with RESs. Specifically, the proposed RESs and EVCSs planning framework considers three sub-objectives to be minimized, i.e., voltage deviations, energy losses, and EVs owners’dissatisfaction. Further, active power curtailment of RESs is precluded while considering the diverse operational constraints of the grid, RESs, and EVCSs. To provide further benefits, advanced control schemes of the interconnecting RES inverters, grid-to-vehicle (G2V), and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes are considered in the proposed framework. A two-level approach is developed to solve this holistic framework with competing sub-functions to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. The outer optimization level precisely optimizes the RES locations and sizes, along with the optimal places of the EVCS. On the other hand, the inner level determines the optimal EVCS charging considering stochastic EV power, RES inverter reactive power, and the time-of-use energy tariff. The proposed framework has been tested on the 69-bus distribution system. The simulation results reveal the efficacy of the proposed RES and EVCS planning framework.

The proposed hybrid approach is to work in conjunction with Mexican Axolotl optimization (MAO) and Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO) hence it is named as MAOWHO approach. The major purposes of the proposed approach are to site and size of the electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL) and to improve the benefit of EVPL for the participation of the reserve market. In addition, power loss and voltage fluctuations occur due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EV) demand load, which is reduced by the proposed approach. To optimally determine the size of the parking lot, the MAOWHO approach is adopted. The integration of the EV and PV systems, especially in parking lots, enhances the reliability and flexibility of the electrical system at critical moments. Multiple objective optimization problems are calculated to achieve objective variables to reduce power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and supply costs, and EV costs. The location and capacity of the RES and EV charging stations in this optimization problem are objective variables. The MAOWHO approach enhances Solar Powered Electric Vehicle Parking Lot (EVSPL) participation in various energy and ancillary service markets that includes the effects of capacity payments.

The rapid growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry adds complexity, increasing overall electricity demand and straining the power supply during peak charging times. This paper proposes a scheduling strategy for EV aggregators to reduce renewable energy curtailment and stabilize grid operation by strategically scheduling EV charging. Using Multi -Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim), a traffic simulation tool, EV driving data in Denver, Colorado, USA, were modeled. The EV aggregator adjusts charging fees based on locational marginal prices, encouraging EVs to charge at different stations according to pricing.

At the beginning of each planning stage, an optimal placement policy for each service provider is obtained through analyzing strategic interactions in a Bayesian game. To derive the optimal placement policy, we consider both the transportation network graph and the electric power network graph. A simulation software - the EV Virtual City 1.0 - is developed using Java to investigate the interactions among the consumers (EV owner), the transportation network graph, the electric power network graph, and the charging stations. Through a series of experiments using the geographic and demographic data from the city of the San Pedro District of Los Angeles, CA, USA, we show that the charging station placement is highly consistent with the heatmap of the traffic flow.

Firstly, the coordinate charging/discharging load model for EV has been established, to obtain a narrowed gap between load peak and valley. Next, a multi-objective optimization model of the distribution grid is also defined, and the active power loss and node voltage fluctuation are chosen to be the objective function. For improving the efficiency of optimization process, an advanced genetic algorithm associated with elite preservation policy is used. Finally, reactive compensation capacity supplied by capacitor banks is dynamically determined according to the varying building loads. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on the IEEE 33-node test case, and the simulation results show that the power supply pressure can be obviously relieved by introducing the coordinated charging/discharging behavior of EV; in the meantime, via reasonable planning of the compensation capacitor, the remarkably lower active power loss and voltage excursion can be realized, ensuring the safe and economical operation of the distribution system.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-020-0154-0","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2017JJ5044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10371378","Distribution network;Electric vehicles;Multi-objective optimization;Coordinated dispatch;Advanced J genetic algorithm","Voltage measurement;Voltage fluctuations;Fluctuations;Power supplies;Buildings;Capacitors;Distribution networks","","45","","15","","22 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

The problem is formulated as an objective function that minimizes the total price of charging incurred by the charging stations and the peak-to-average ratio. To diminish the negative impact of EVs on the node voltage in the distribution system, EVs are also modeled as a reactive power compensating device. Simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and an in-depth study is presented on the maximum feasible EV penetration to the existing system without augmentation. The problem is solved using a novel metaheuristic optimization called the water cycle algorithm. The proposed charging/discharging strategy works well and results in the housing of higher penetration of EVs in the distribution network along with a reduction in the charging price. Moreover, with the proposed coordinated strategy, the node voltage variation is found within the permissible limits.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.3002769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9131789","Electric vehicles (EVs);grid-to-vehicle (G2V);reactive power compensation;vehicle-to-grid (V2G);water cycle algorithm (WCA)","Vehicle-to-grid;State of charge;Distribution networks;Reactive power;Batteries;Electric vehicle charging;Minimization","","90","","31","IEEE","2 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the DDT method, aggregators reveal their final aggregated plan and respect the plan during operation. By establishing an equivalent overall optimization, it is proven that the DDT method is able to minimize the overall energy consumption cost and line loss cost, which is different from the previous decomposition-based methods such as multiagent system methods.

To reduce mismatches between the bidding amounts for VBs and actual transacted amounts for EVs, we suggest a novel binary progressive hedging algorithm to quickly determine the VB operations.

Were these gains to be substantial, they could be reflected in future charging tariffs as a means of encouraging EV ownership. However, where the impact of EVs is being quantified, much of the system benefit can only be observed where generator scheduling is performed by unit-commitment based methods. By making use of a rapid, yet robust unit-commitment algorithm, in the context of a capacity expansion procedure, this paper quantifies the impact of EVs for a variety of demand and wind time-series, relative fuel costs and EV penetrations. Typically, the net-cost of EV charging increases with EV penetration and CO2 cost, and falls with increasing wind. Frequently however these relationships do not apply, where changes in an input often lead to step-changes in the optimal plant mix.

Many smart devices exist in the smart grid environment. These devices may share their data with one another using the ICT-based infrastructure. The analysis of the data generated from various smart devices in the smart grid environment is one of the most challenging tasks to be performed as it varies with respect to parameters such as size, volume, velocity, and variety. The output of the data analysis needs to be transferred to the end users using various networks and smart appliances. But sometimes networks may become overloaded during such data transmissions to various smart devices. Consequently, significant delays may be incurred, which affect the overall performance of any implemented solution in this environment. We investigate the use of VDTNs as one of the solutions for data dissemination to various devices in the smart grid environment using mobile edge computing. VDTNs use the store-and-carry forward mechanism for message dissemination to various smart devices so that delays can be reduced during overloading and congestion situations in the core networks. As vehicles have high mobility, we propose mobile edge network support assisted by the cloud environment to manage the handoff and the processing of large data sets generated by various smart devices in the smart grid environment. In the proposed architecture, most of the computation for making decisions about charging and discharging is done by mobile devices such as vehicles located at the edge of the network (also called mobile edge computing). The computing and communication aspects are explored to analyze the impact of mobile edge computing on performance metrics such as message transmission delay, response time, and throughput to the end users using vehicles as the mobile nodes. Our empirical results demonstrate an improved performance 10-15 percent increase in throughput, 20 percent decrease in response time, and 10 percent decrease in the delay incurred with our proposed solution compared to existing state-ofthe- art solutions in the literature.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2016.7588230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7588230","","Mobile communication;Cloud computing;Delay tolerant networks;Servers;Mobile computing;Green design;Smart grids;Information and communication technology","","159","","14","IEEE","14 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

First, we propose a hierarchical architecture for the utility-customer interaction consisting of sub-components of customer load prediction, renewable generation integration, power-load balancing and demand response (DR). Within this hierarchical architecture, we focus on the problem of real-time scheduling in an abstract grid model consisting of one controller and multiple customer units. A scalable solution to the real-time scheduling problem is proposed by combining solutions to two sub-problems: (1) centralized sequential decision making at the controller to maximize an accumulated reward for the whole micro-grid and (2) distributed auctioning among all customers based on the optimal load profile obtained by solving the first problem to coordinate their interactions. We formulate the centralized sequential decision making at the controller as a hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP). Next, a Vikrey auctioning game is designed to coordinate the actions of the individual smart-homes to actually achieve the optimal solution derived by the controller under realistic gird interaction assumptions. We show that though truthful bidding is a weakly dominant strategy for all smart-homes in the auctioning game, collusive equilibria do exist and can jeopardize the effectiveness and efficiency of the trading opportunity allocation. Analysis on the structure of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution set shows that the Vickrey auctioning game can be made more robust against collusion by customers (anticipating distributed smart-homes) by introducing a positive reserve price. The corresponding auctioning game is then shown to converge to the unique incentive compatible truthful bidding Bayesian Nash equilibrium, without jeopardizing the auctioneer's (microgrid controller's) profit. The paper also explicitly discusses how this two-step solution approach can be scaled to be suitable for more complicated smart grid architectures beyond the assumed abstract model.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748053","Bayesian Nash equilibria;hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP);hierarchical architecture;microgrid;resource pooling;smart-home;truthful bidding strategy;utility-customer interaction;Vickrey auction","Microgrids;Smart grids;Real-time systems;Decision making;Planning;Games;Load modeling","","59","","37","IEEE","25 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main problem with EVs is the requirement of charging energy, which is fed through distribution network, while simultaneously feeding already connected load. The EV’s integration with the distribution network will overload the network due to EV’s charging load, which will eventually trip the power system protection. In this context, it is necessary to minimize power losses, improve voltage profile with sustainable power supply network. Therefore, optimal placement of EVs is required in the distribution network. Conventionally, researchers have used DGs to minimize power losses and improve voltage profile. In this paper, authors analyzed the effect of EV’s integration with simultaneous placement of distributed generations (DGs). The integration of EVs with higher penetration of DGs is cumbersome due to higher power losses and voltage variances that are outside allowable boundaries. The optimal placement of EVs into the distribution system with higher penetration of DGs is proposed in this paper using a battle royale optimization (BRO) algorithm. Since it is a new problem on CIGRE network which is not discussed before. Hence, the authors compared results with three most famous algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and accelerated PSO (APSO). The optimization problem is developed as a multi-objective function while decreasing active and reactive power losses, and minimising maximum voltage deviation index. The studied distribution network is the CIGRE 14-bus medium voltage (MV) distribution network. Three case studies are taken in which EVs are integrated in two scenarios with optimally sized and located DGs systems in the CIGRE distribution network using MATLAB. Case-1 includes simple network with DGs integration. Case-2 includes EVs only in the simple network, and case-3 finally includes EVs and DGs for optimal placement with minimum losses. The placement of the EVs results in a decrease in power losses and voltage deviation indices. The bus voltages of case-2, on the other hand, stay unchanged when the EVs are integrated. Case 3 with BRO showed the large reduction in power losses owing to the addition of EVs to the distribution network with DGs (from 19.98 kW, and 19.89 kVar to 2.54 kW, and 3.35 kVar).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204311","Project Open Innovation R&D (21-AE-001); K-water; Bahria University through Higher Education Commission (HEC) National Research Program for Universities (NRPU)(grant numbers:20-14578/NRPU/R&D/HEC/2021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9877797","Accelerated PSO (APSO);battle royale optimization (BRO) algorithm;CIGRE 14-bus MV distribution network;distributed generators;genetic algorithm (GA);multi-objective optimization;optimal placement of EVs;particle swarm optimization (PSO);power loss minimization;voltage profile improvement","Distribution networks;Voltage control;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Particle swarm optimization;Benchmark testing;Power system stability;Power distribution;Loss measurement","","10","","60","CCBY","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the dc OLEV power system is being investigated for reducing line losses and peak power thereby reducing the electric cost levied on the substation. Verification processes are performed through simulation for various scenarios to examine the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of power consumption, battery state of charge, peak power, and loss reduction.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2013.2251667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6478834","Contactless power transfer system;dc distribution system;electric vehicles (EVs);online electric vehicle (OLEV);wireless charging vehicle","Substations;Inverters;Electric vehicles;Batteries;Traction motors;Power supplies","","45","","32","IEEE","12 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To meet the diverse EV charging demand, we propose a market-based coordinated planning method of fast charging station (FCS) and dynamic wireless charging system (DWCS). Firstly, a bi-level coordinated planning model considering the benefits of charging service provider and EV user group is built. It can make full use of the complementary characteristics of FCSs and DWCSs. Then, the energy demand assignment(EDA) approach that can directly assign energy demand to roads and power nodes is proposed and applied in the inner level of bi-level coordinated planning model. Finally, the cases that consider the impact of differentiated traffic demand and land prices in different regions are proposed. The case studies are formulated based on the 21 power nodes-12 traffic nodes network and the 54 power nodes-25 traffic nodes network. To calculate the optimal solution, the KKT conditions, the McCormick relaxation approach, the optimization-based bound tightening approach (OBBT) and the sequential bound tightening approach (SBT) are employed.

Many small-scale electricity suppliers (SESs) have recently entered the electricity market, which has been traditionally dominated by a few large-scale electricity suppliers. The emergence of SESs enables direct trading (DT) of electricity between SESs and end-users (EUs), without going through retailers, and promotes the possibility of improving the benefits to both parties. In this paper, the cooperation between SESs and EUs in DT is analyzed based on coalitional game theory. In particular, an electricity pricing scheme that achieves a fair division of revenue between SESs and EUs is analytically derived by using the asymptotic Shapley value. The asymptotic Shapley value is shown to be in the core of the coalitional game such that no group of SESs and EUs has an incentive to abandon the coalition, which implies the stable operation of DT for the proposed pricing scheme. Unlike the existing pricing schemes that typically require multiple stages of calculations and real time information about each participant, the electricity price for the proposed scheme can be determined instantaneously based on the number of participants in DT and statistical information about electricity supply and demand. Therefore, the proposed pricing scheme is suitable for practical implementation. Using computer simulations, the price of electricity for the proposed DT scheme is examined in various environments, and the numerical results validate the asymptotic analysis. Moreover, the revenues of the SESs and EUs are evaluated for various types of SESs and different numbers of participants in DT. The optimal ratio of different types of SESs is also investigated.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2332112","Korean Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840296","Smart grid;renewable energy;electricity market;direct trading;coalitional game;Shapley value","Electricity;Games;Pricing;Silicon;Electricity supply industry;Smart grids;Niobium","","181","","36","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this aim, a regret-matching technique is introduced to model the bounded rationality of PEV owners in deciding the choice to use different charging options for recharging their vehicle, as a dependency with respect to the incentive value and the accessibility of the charging service in long-term horizon. Such endogenous uncertainties are considered simultaneously with the inherent exogenous randomness of PEV demand and captured by the proposed PL planning model using a proper scenario generation method.

Existing research on EV routing planning and charging navigation strategies mainly focuses on vehicle-road-network interactions, but the vehicle-to-vehicle interaction has rarely been considered, particularly in studying simultaneous charging requests. To investigate the interaction of multiple vehicles in routing planning and charging, a routing optimization of EVs for charging with an event-driven pricing strategy is proposed. The urban area of a city is taken as a case for numerical simulation, which demonstrates that the proposed strategy can not only alleviate the long-time queuing for EV fast charging but also improve the utilization rate of charging infrastructures. Note to Practitioners—This article was inspired by the concerns of difficulties for electric vehicle (EV)’s fast charging and the imbalance of the utilization rate of charging facilities. Existing route optimization and charging navigation research are mainly applicable to static traffic networks, which cannot dynamically adjust driving routes and charging strategies with real-time traffic information. Besides, the mutual impact between vehicles is rarely considered in these works in routing planning. To resolve the shortcomings of existing models, a receding-horizon-based strategy that can be applied to dynamic traffic networks is proposed. In this article, various factors that the user is concerned about within the course of driving are converted into driving costs, through which each road section of traffic networks is assigned the corresponding values. Combined with the graph theory analysis method, the mathematical form of the dynamic traffic network is presented. Then, the article carefully plans and adjusts EV driving routes and charging strategies. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly increase the adoption of EV fast charging while alleviating unreasonable distributions of regional charging demand.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2021.3102997","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807127,52111530067); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2020YFSY0037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9517319","Electric vehicle (EV);event-driven;navigation;receding-horizon;routing optimization","Routing;Charging stations;Navigation;Pricing;Electric vehicle charging;Roads;Power grids","","49","","42","IEEE","19 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the upper level, a distribution company decides the optimal deployment of WCL, subject to PDN constraints. With the upper-level WCL deployment decisions, in the lower level, each EV makes optimal routing and charging decisions to minimize the sum of its travel and charging costs.

The joint optimization of power grid operation and EV scheduling is expected to achieve better decision-making for both power and transportation systems. However, such joint optimization can suffer from high computational complexity and a lack of information about the other system. One possible approach for the power system operator is to assume the charging/discharging pattern of the EV population and make dispatch decisions based on such estimated EV profiles. This practice results in grid-level policies. The problem arises as whether the EV population complies with and fulfills the grid-level policies is not easy to monitor. To address this issue, we further investigate and expand upon the innovative concept of grid facilitation for electric vehicles (EVs). A newly designed probabilistic incentive signal is introduced to assist in implementing grid policies. Correspondingly, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for EV prosumer scheduling that effectively balances EV autonomy with the execution of grid policies. Cast as a demand response signal, the grid-level policy is capable of managing overall grid operation with the facilitation of individuals and decoupling the co-optimization of the operator and EV owner. For the DRL of the EV, the training reward considers both the EV operation cost and the grid facilitation incentive, featuring a dynamically shrinking EV battery’s feasible operation range in terms of voltages and currents, and the health-informed reward. The policy-aware reward utilizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify the gap between the actual EV power injection pattern and the system operator’s assumption. Invalid action mask tricks are integrated to prevent infeasible actions for EVs. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the facilitation effect of EV on system operation planning.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2024.3460486","Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore(grant numbers:M23M6c0114); Toyota North America; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10680085","EV facilitation;co-optimization;health-informed life feasibility operation region;deep reinforcement learning;soft lifespan constraint","Batteries;Optimization;Costs;Probabilistic logic;Deep reinforcement learning;Power system stability;Degradation","","2","","44","IEEE","13 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stochastic variations are addressed using a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. The objective of the planning model is the minimization of DS installation and operation costs. The optimal planning solution is obtained by dividing the hybrid planning problem into two nested optimization problems: 1) the main problem is formulated using a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the optimal AC-DC configuration and 2) the subproblem is used for determining the optimal power flow solution for each configuration generated by the GA. The proposed model has been employed for finding the optimal configuration for a suggested case study that included photovoltaic panels, wind-based DG, and electric vehicle charging stations. The same case study was also solved using a traditional AC planning technique in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the associated cost-savings.

This requires an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs). Such an allocation strategy should provide acceptable charging services at different deployment stages while meeting financial and technical constraints. As new CSs get allocated, distributed generation (DG) units need to be also dynamically allocated in both space and time to compensate for the increment in the loads due to the EV charging requests. Unfortunately, existing power grid models are not suitable to reflect such spatio-temporal evolution, and hence, new models need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal expanding power grid model based on stochastic geometry. Using this flexible model, we perform a dynamic joint allocation of EV CSs and DG units based on a constrained Markov decision process. The proposed dynamic allocation strategy accounts for charging coordination mechanism within each CS, which in turn allows for maximal usage of deployed chargers.

In Bakhshayesh and Kebriaei (2022), the problem of choosing the route and CSs of EVs is modeled as a non-cooperative game of selfish EVs with probabilistic decision strategies. In this paper, we have proposed a linear pricing policy that ensures global efficiency of the obtained Nash strategies of EVs in Bakhshayesh and Kebriaei (2022) for the Smart City Coordinator (SCC). We model the problem as a hierarchical game with a SCC as the leader and EVs as the followers. The leader aims to design optimal price functions of CSs and Traffic Coordinator (TC) and impose them on the EVs to maximize the social profits of CSs and TC. In response, the followers play a non-cooperative game with coupling constraints to optimally decide on their route and charging destination. Thus, we have a Stackelberg Game (SG) between SCC and EVs and also a Nash game among the EVs in the lower level. Compared to the conventional Nash-based pricing policies, our proposed functional SG formulation enables the possibility of simultaneous and global-optimum management of traffic and CSs’ crowdedness. Moreover, we have proposed a two-level decentralized algorithm that preserves the privacy of EVs and have considered a decentralized computation for equilibrium seeking of followers based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method.

The interaction between the spot prices and the EV demand needs to be considered in the EV charging scheduling, otherwise it will lead to a higher charging cost. A day-ahead EV charging scheduling based on an aggregative game model is proposed in this paper. The impacts of the EV demand on the electricity prices are formulated with the game model in the scheduling considering possible actions of other EVs.

Finally, the optimal ESS size is determined using the annualized ESS cost, penalty cost for buying power during peak hours, and penalty cost for resilience violations. Simulations along with sensitivity analysis of uncertainties (market price, arrival time of EVs, and the residual energy level of EVs), number of EVs in the FCS, and converter ratings are conducted. Simulation results have shown that increasing the penalty cost for peak intervals is a viable solution to decrease the peak load while controlling the cost of the FCS.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2020.2980744","Energy Efficiency and Resources of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Korea Government Ministry of Knowledge Economy(grant numbers:20192010106750); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9035428","Battery energy storage system (BESS);electric vehicles (EVs);fast-charging station (FCS);resilience;sizing","Resilience;Charging stations;Power system reliability;Batteries;Electric vehicles","","160","","43","IEEE","13 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, effective scheduling of both resources holds the key to sustainable practice. This paper presents a scheduling scenario-based approach in the smart grid. Problem formulation with dual objective function including both emissions and cost is developed for conventional unit commitment with EV and RET deployment. In this work, the scheduling and commitment problem is solved using the fireworks algorithm which mimics explosion of fireworks in the sky to define search space and the distance between associated sparks to evaluate global minimum. Further, binary coded fireworks algorithm is developed for the proposed scheduling problem in the smart grid. Thereafter, possible scenarios in conventional as well as smart grid are put forward.

However, designing an efficient coordinated charging strategy to route mobile EVs to fast-charging stations for globally optimal energy utilization is very challenging. In this paper, we investigate a special smart grid with enhanced communication capabilities, i.e., a VANET-enhanced smart grid. It exploits vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to support real-time communications among road-side units (RSUs) and highly mobile EVs for collecting real-time vehicle mobility information or dispatching charging decisions. Then, we propose a mobility-aware coordinated charging strategy for EVs, which not only improves the overall energy utilization while avoiding power system overloading, but also addresses the range anxieties of individual EVs by reducing the average travel cost. Specifically, the mobility-incurred travel cost for an EV is considered in two aspects: 1) the travel distance from the current position of the EV to a charging station; and 2) the transmission delay for receiving a charging decision via VANETs. The optimal mobility-aware coordinated EV charging problem is formulated as a time-coupled mixed-integer linear programming problem. By solving this problem based on Lagrange duality and branch-and-bound-based outer approximation techniques, an efficient charging strategy is obtained. To evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy, a realistic suburban scenario is developed in VISSIM to track vehicle mobility through the generated simulation traces, based on which the travel cost of each EV can be accurately calculated. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy considerably outperforms the traditional EV charging strategy without VANETs on the metrics of the overall energy utilization, the average EV travel cost, and the number of successfully charged EVs.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2332078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840326","Mobile EVs;coordinated fast charging;range anxiety;VANETs;smart grid","Vehicles;Charging stations;Smart grids;Real-time systems;Batteries;Mobile communication","","101","","49","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The large proliferation of PEVs has been significantly creating impact on the transportation and power sector in recent times. However, uncoordinated charging of PEVs leads to congestion in distribution feeders when the penetration of PEVs is reasonably high. A charging coordination strategy of grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is formulated considering the large PEVs penetration in the distribution system. In this article, the popular ensemble method, i.e., gradient boosting regression tree method is employed to predict the state-of-charge for PEVs batteries. The charging coordination of G2V-V2G mode is developed in order to study the maximum PEVs penetration in the distribution system with an objective function of minimizing overall cost. The strategy is implemented in workplace car park powered by grid and grid-connected photovoltaic generation located in industrial areas of the IEEE 38 bus radial distribution system. An analytical study is presented to evaluate the maximum possible PEV penetration that the distribution network can accommodate without violating the grid constraints.

Therefore, the necessity of energy storage systems (ESSs) is more than evident. ESSs have excessive manufacturing costs, implying that the purchase cost for residential users can be prohibitive. In the present work, a distributed optimal small-scale PV energy system sizing strategy is proposed, by considering the individual energy needs of each residence and their EVs.

This article proposes a hierarchical framework for the optimal P2P trading among EVCSs in constrained urban transportation networks (UTNs) and power distribution networks (PDNs). The UTN operation is incorporated through a multiperiod traffic flow assignment problem (MTAP), which is solved by the transportation system operator (TSO). After receiving the corresponding EV assignments, a P2P trading approach is considered among EVCSs, which would emphasize EVCS privacy while minimizing the TE trading cost. The trading results are subsequently delivered by EVCSs to the distribution system operator (DSO), which would solve a three-phase unbalanced optimal power flow to guarantee the secure PDN operation. If any PDN constraints are violated, a trading adjustment signal will be returned to each EVCS in an iterative process. Numerical experiments based on EVCSs located on a 12-node UTN and the modified IEEE 33-bus PDN validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical P2P coordination approach and solution methodology, where the total operation cost of EVCSS is reduced by 16.61%.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2023.3315398","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, “Research on Frontier Basic Theory and Method of Security Defense for Power Systems with High-dimensional Uncertain Factors(grant numbers:BK20222003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10251469","Electric vehicle charging station (EVCS);hierarchical coordination;peer-to-peer (P2P) trading market;power distribution;urban transportation networks (UTNs)","Partial discharges;Transportation;Peer-to-peer computing;Costs;Indexes;Privacy;Electric vehicle charging","","11","","40","IEEE","14 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a centralized scheme is established and admits an optimal coordination behaviour that minimizes the aggregate generation cost and all the EVs’ local costs. However, the coupling of the charging behaviours among the EV population brings challenges to the design of the decentralized algorithm, which is expected to converge to the global optimum. A partial augmented Lagrangian method is presented to disperse the coupling constraint by introducing a penalty term. Combined with the gradient projection method, an iterative procedure is designed such that each EV and feeder line update in parallel until satisfying the terminal condition.

This evolution is likely to be accompanied by a parallel evolution of the electricity supply business with the deployment of smart grid technologies. As a consequence, it is expected that demand will feature higher potential for communication and control, which will enable its active participation in the daily operational planning of power systems. In particular, EVs being equipped with a battery can both defer their demand or inject electricity back into the system. However, to achieve volumes that can have an impact on the system, these demands need to be aggregated and operated as an ensemble. This paper proposes the necessary adaptations to include the input of EV aggregation to electricity markets. This permits the scheduling of EV charging and services in coordination with the system operator thus enhancing the power system's efficiency and security while reducing its environmental impact. Results show that the EVs penetration levels that the system would be able to absorb without requiring expansion of the supply side, are significantly increased when coordination over their charging schedule is performed.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2221750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353242","Aggregator;electric vehicles;electricity market;power generation scheduling and dispatch;spinning reserve;vehicle-to-grid","Batteries;Electric vehicles;Power markets;Cost function","","209","1","43","IEEE","15 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Random installation of EVCs may cause voltage disturbances, power quality disturbances and power losses in the distribution network. The hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm algorithm (HGAMSSA) was used to determine the optimal EVCs placement in the distribution network by considering power losses, network capacity and voltage regulation. HGAMSSA is a combination of GA and MSSA. In the first stage, the GA method distributes the population randomly and the second stage crosses the membership between dimensions. In the third stage, MSSA processes the best population from the GA to determine the best objective function. The HGAMSSA incorporates Optimal Power Flow (OPF) calculations based on Newton-Raphson. The OPF simulation uses a modified 20kV IEEE 33 bus distribution network. For validation, HGAMSSA was compared with four different algorithms: GA, PSO, SSA, and MPSO. There are three test scenarios with populations of 100, 50, and 20. As a result, the power loss generated as the best objective function wase 0.15715 MW. When the population is 100, HGAMSSA has the fastest iteration (5th) in achieving the best objective function compared with MPSO (13th) and SSA (17th). Furthermore, the best objective function can only be achieved by HGAMSSA when the populations are 50 and 20. This shows that HGAMSSA can explore and exploit populations performance to identify the optimal objective function.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3458982","Government of Indonesia, Center for Higher Education Funding (BPPT)-Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) through the Beasiswa Pendidikan Indonesia(grant numbers:202209092693); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10679119","Hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm algorithm (HGAMSSA);charging station;electric vehicle;OPF;hybrid algorithm","Genetic algorithms;Optimization methods;Linear programming;Distribution networks;Particle swarm optimization;Metaheuristics;Electric vehicle charging","","7","","47","CCBYNCND","12 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is important to perform intelligent scheduling for charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs). However, there are two major challenges in the scheduling problem. First, it is challenging to find the globally optimal scheduling solution which can minimize the total cost. Second, it is difficult to find a distributed scheduling scheme which can handle a large population and the random arrivals of the EVs. In this paper, we propose a globally optimal scheduling scheme and a locally optimal scheduling scheme for EV charging and discharging. We first formulate a global scheduling optimization problem, in which the charging powers are optimized to minimize the total cost of all EVs which perform charging and discharging during the day. The globally optimal solution provides the globally minimal total cost. However, the globally optimal scheduling scheme is impractical since it requires the information on the future base loads and the arrival times and the charging periods of the EVs that will arrive in the future time of the day. To develop a practical scheduling scheme, we then formulate a local scheduling optimization problem, which aims to minimize the total cost of the EVs in the current ongoing EV set in the local group. The locally optimal scheduling scheme is not only scalable to a large EV population but also resilient to the dynamic EV arrivals. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the locally optimal scheduling scheme can achieve a close performance compared to the globally optimal scheduling scheme.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2173507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6244822","Charging and discharging;convex optimization;distributed solution;electric vehicle;optimal scheduling;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Optimal scheduling;Batteries;Electricity;Dynamic scheduling;Electric vehicles","","683","1","25","IEEE","19 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some of the uncertainty sources are related with technical parameters of PEVs. Therefore, a review of PEVs currently available in the market is reported. Other uncertain parameters are related with the behavior of the PEV owners, for instance, the arrival and departure times to home, and the state of charge of the PEV when it is plugged to the grid. These parameters are modeled by using probability density functions, to then generate random numbers and perform Monte Carlo simulations. Each Monte Carlo simulation corresponds to the calculation of a power-flow in the analyzed network. The proposed methodology is tested on the IEEE 33-bus test distribution network, with the purpose of quantifying the influence of diversity of PEVs. The analysis is performed, specifically, for identify those transformers and lines that could be overloaded. Two scenarios of PEV penetration by 2025 and 2030 were assessed, i.e., considering that 10 and 30 percent of the residential customers will have at least one PEV, respectively.

Then, we propose a distributed energy storage planning approach based on game algorithm in DSM, which helps users select the appropriate size of storage units for balancing the cost in the planning period and during its use. Since planning problems may lead to consumer discomfort, we propose a cost function consisting of the billing, generation costs, and discomfort costs to balance users' preferences with the payment. Furthermore, a game theory-based distributed energy management scheme is developed in DSM without leaking user privacy, which is used as inner optimization in our proposed distributed energy storage planning approach.

Accurately predicting the realistic charging demand of EVs is an essential part of the infrastructure planning. Charging demand of EVs is influenced by several factors, such as driver behavior, location of charging stations, electricity pricing, etc. In order to implement an optimal charging infrastructure, it is important to consider all the relevant factors that influence the charging demand of EVs. Several studies have modeled and simulated the charging demands of individual and groups of EVs. However, in many cases, the models do not consider factors related to the social characteristics of EV drivers. Other studies do not emphasize on economic elements.

In this paper, a planning model for dynamic wireless charging systems (DWCS) is proposed. First, a DWCS-integrated user-equilibrium (UE) model is proposed to assign the traffic flow in transportation networks. The traffic assignment model considers the charging requirement and range anxiety of EVs. Range anxiety refers to concerns about the potential for running out of battery power. Then, the DWCS-integrated UE model is embedded in the DWCS planning scheme. The placement of dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) facilities and the scale of inverters are determined by the formulated bi-level optimization. The coordinated planning model of DWCS and electricity networks is proposed by comprehensively considering the geographical and electrical characteristics of the DWPT facilities and the inverters. The formulated nonlinear mixed-integer bi-level optimization problem is solved according to a branch and bound algorithm, and the  $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon }$  convergence to the global optimality will be guaranteed.

By determining the optimal sitting, size and cost of the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), these power quality issues & threats can be overcome as BESS can rapidly inject or absorb power as needed. In case of any cyber threat, it can supply energy to critical areas, reducing the cascading effect and increasing the survivability of the distribution network. Therefore, this paper provides a review of the existing methodologies used for the optimal placement, sizing, and cost of BESS in distributed networks involving Distributed Energy Resources and Electric Vehicles. Additionally, it provides insights into cascading effects in power systems due to cyber-attack, especially FDI attacks or component failure. After a thorough literature survey of the existing methods utilized for placement, sitting, costing, and modelling techniques, the paper concludes by providing a framework to enhance the grid resiliency against such power quality issues by improving the quality and reducing the minimum disruption area in case of any FDI attack. The proposed framework differs from the existing methodologies as it provides adaptive ancillary services and dynamic BESS response to address the operational and security challenges, based on this framework EV load penetration is estimated. Further to this EV load will be integrated into the dynamic distribution grid to analyze grid parameters including frequency, voltage, and line losses considered to be the future research work of the authors. However, the proposed framework has some challenges, including data dependency for stochastic modelling, computational challenges, and high quality for reliable optimization results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3514842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10788685","Battery energy storage systems;cascading;cyber-attack;distributed energy resources;distributed networks;uncertainties;false data injection","Renewable energy sources;Batteries;Power system stability;Transportation;Voltage fluctuations;Uncertainty;Fluctuations;Distribution networks;Cyberattack;Power system protection","","6","","170","CCBYNCND","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, building costly new circuits to accommodate generation and demand growth is time-consuming and environmentally unfriendly. Therefore, active network management (ANM) has been promoted in many countries, aiming to relieve network pressure. Previous research in ANM was focused on distribution areas with significant renewable penetration, where ANM reduced network pressure through significantly enhanced generation curtailment strategies rather than adopting traditional asset investment. This paper proposes the use of electric vehicles (EVs) as responsive demand to complement network stress relief that was purely based on generation curtailment. It is achieved by allowing EVs to absorb excessive renewable generation when they cause network pressure, and it thus can provide additional measures to generation curtailment strategies. The approach is illustrated on a practical extra-high voltage distribution system. The analyses clearly demonstrate the combined management of demand and generation is superior to previous sole generation management. The combined management strategy can achieve 7.9% improvement in utilization of renewable energy, and subsequently increase the net investment profit by £566 k.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2282707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665190","Active network management;demand side management;electric vehicle;network pressure;renewable energy generation","Electricity;Batteries;Investment;Artificial intelligence;Renewable energy sources;Electric vehicles","","55","","36","IEEE","14 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the lack of pervasive en-route charging infrastructure on regional highway networks hinders the use of electric vehicles for long-distance intercity trips. Traditionally, transportation and power systems are often studied separately, each by itself as a complex system. This paper proposes a system of systems modeling framework for planning charging infrastructure deployment in intercity transportation networks while considering users’ travel behavior and coupling relationships between transportation and power systems. The aim is at facilitating long-distance electric vehicle travels and providing an effective and comprehensive tool to evaluate the total emissions from both the transportation and power sectors. We look at a somewhat “forward-looking” problem in which the charging loads of widely-adopted electric vehicles induce interdependence between the power and the transportation sectors. A general equilibrium modeling framework is developed to capture the interdependencies among charging infrastructure design, users’ travel behaviors, and power sector operations. An iterative solution approach is proposed to solve the overall equilibrium between the transportation and power sectors, and a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the bi-level subproblem for the charging infrastructure deployment.

Derived from DC power network, an analytical approach is proposed to efficiently assess the congestion induced wind curtailment sensitivity without iterative simulation. Compared to empirical simulation-based wind curtailment studies, the proposed approach offers the following advantages: 1) computational efficiency, 2) low input information requirement, and 3) robustness against uncertainties.

First, the probability density of the travel time parameters for EVs is calculated based on an improved kernel density estimation (IKDE) method. Second, the carbon emissions at each stage of the lifecycle of EVs are calculated using a life cycle assessment approach (LCA), and a model for EV carbon quota and carbon revenue is constructed.

Finally, with the objective of reducing the dispatching cost for EV users and stabilizing the load fluctuation of the power distribution network, an optimization model for EV charging and discharging load dispatching is constructed. Based on the dynamic charging and discharging tariff information and state of charge (SOC) at the time of access to the grid, an evaluation model of the economic benefits of EV participation in orderly regulation is constructed. The response willingness of EV users to the dispatching strategy is inferred using the fuzzy logic control algorithm.

This paper aims to enhance the environmental benefits of EVs by differentiating the marginal impacts of coal-fired unit emissions at various times and locations on ambient air pollutant concentration (AAPC) and human health conditions. The proposed cost-effective approach will assign EV battery charging loads and other electricity demands to generation units with low health impacts. The proposed air pollution dispersion model maps the emission into spatial AAPC increments ( ${\Delta }$ AAPCs), and concentration-response function maps  ${\Delta }$ AAPCs into health impacts. As such, we estimate differentiating health impacts of emissions at various times and locations without executing large-scale atmospheric models. We also integrate differentiating emission regulations with the joint optimization of security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and EV battery swapping-charging system (BSCS). BSCS refers to the optimal scheduling of an aggregated number of EV batteries which are centrally charged and then dispatched via delivery trucks to battery swapping stations (BSSs) to supply local EVs.

Instead of making this assumption, we specifically examine the innate non-cooperative nature of two different entities involved in the planning problem. Namely, they are the charging service provider (CSP) and the fleet operator (FO). To address the strategic interaction between entities, a bi-level mixed integer program is formulated, with the CSP/FO’s problem expressed in the upper/lower levels respectively, in a joint decision making process.

EM in a power distribution system (PDS) can reduce the system losses, operational costs and emissions, and increases system's reliability, voltage stability and efficiency. This article expands the PDS using different distributed energy resources (DERs) and observes their impacts on EM success, operational costs, system losses, and emissions. Moreover, the impacts of integrating reactive sources (RSs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and electric vehicles (EVs) on the system's operational performance is investigated. An index is defined to measure the energy management success rate (EMSR) and several case studies are created for investigating variety of system expansion options individually and collectively. Furthermore, a new reliability index, namely reliability index success rate (RISR), is defined and sensitivity analysis are presented to investigate the DERs impacts on system's voltage controllability and the defined reliability index. A new hybrid PSO-TS optimization algorithm is developed, and the well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution network is selected for the simulations. Several case studies presented in the paper provide a clear understanding of the impacts of integrating different resources on the EM as well as other operational aspects of a PDS. The results reveal that the system expansion using DERs with different capacities along with EM strategies could have significant impacts on PDS performance depending on the DERs types' and capacities. Due to their availability and low operational costs, gas turbine further improves the performance indices comparing to the renewables that have uncertain availability and to diesel generators with their high operational costs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288678","Energy management;power distribution system;distributed generation;renewable energy;ESS;EVs;emission;optimization;PSO-TS","Reliability;Partial discharges;Indexes;Generators;Energy management;Voltage control;Reactive power","","30","","30","CCBY","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The exactness of the convex relaxation under the proposed condition is proved through constructing a group of monotonic series with limits, which ensures that the optimal solution of the SOCP can be converted to an optimal solution of the original ac OPF.

However, most existing solutions focus mainly on privacy preservation, efficiency, and bidding strategies, while overlooking the critical issue of key parameters distribution—particularly in day-ahead electricity auctions. At the start of an auction, it is essential to distribute key parameters to all participants in a timely, synchronized, and efficient manner. To address the challenges of fairness, collusion resistance, and efficiency in the predistribution of key parameters, we propose an efficient and collusion-resistant key parameters predistribution system (ECR-KPPDS) for day-ahead electricity auctions. As a core component, we design a novel cryptographic primitive, termed identity-based timed-release proxy re-encryption (IBTRPRE). Based on the truncated  $q$ -augmented bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent ( $q$ -ABDHE) hardness assumption, we instantiate two concrete schemes tailored to different security requirements. The proposed schemes eliminate the need for public key authenticity verification, support efficient privilege revocation, and provide resistance against proxy-bidder collusion attacks. In addition, the schemes feature user-scale-independent key and ciphertext sizes, leading to significantly improved the system efficiency compared with existing approaches.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3616212","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018YFA0704703); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972073,61972215,62172238); Key Specialized Research and Development Program of Henan Province(grant numbers:252102210172,222102210062); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11184777","Electricity auction;multiple time servers (TSs);proxy re-encryption;smart grid;timed-release encryption (TRE)","Electricity;Encryption;Receivers;Public key;Security;Resistance;Costs;Electricity supply industry;Servers;Privacy","","","","71","IEEE","30 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Grid-enabled passenger vehicles, like electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) can help address environmental and energy issues. Automakers have recognized that electric drive vehicles are critical to the future of the industry. However, some challenges exist to greater adoption: the perception of cost, EV range, access to charging, potential impacts to the grid, and lack of public awareness about the availability and practicality of these vehicles. Although the current initial price for EV's is higher, their operating costs are lower. Policies that reduce the total cost of ownership of EVs and PHEVs, compared to conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, will lead to faster market penetration. Greater access to charging infrastructure will also accelerate public adoption. Smart grid technology will optimize the vehicle integration with the grid, allowing intelligent and efficient use of energy. By coordinating efforts and using a systems perspective, the advantages of EVs and PHEVs can be achieved using the least resources.

This paper presents a two-stage framework to segment and forecast electric-vehicle (EV) charging behavior using spatio-temporal features extracted from one year of 15-minute telematics for 264 EVs in Saskatchewan, Canada. The feature set combines temporal usage (power/energy levels and variability) with spatial mobility (home-charging ratio, location diversity, travel distance and angular dispersion). We compare three complementary clustering families including Fuzzy C-Means (soft membership), Gaussian Mixtures (probabilistic partitions), and Hierarchical clustering (multiscale structure) and using algorithm-appropriate selection criteria (Xie–Beni, BIC, elbow/Calinski–Harabasz) to ensure a fair assessment. The framework identifies five behaviorally meaningful groups ranging from home-dominant commuters to high-mobility, DC fast-charging users. Hierarchical clustering provides the most balanced and interpretable segmentation (lowest Davies–Bouldin; highest Calinski–Harabasz), while GMM attains the highest Silhouette (0.585) with coarser partitions. In the supervised stage, ensemble classifiers forecast user-segment membership from features, with XGBoost achieving 98.1% accuracy. The outputs translate directly into planning inputs: expected residential feeder peaks for home-centric segments, DC fast-charging demand for high-mobility users, and demand-response potential for managed charging.

However, developing a systematic EV fast charging strategy faces challenges in modeling the coupled power-transportation networks (PTN), devising charging price mechanisms, and optimizing path planning. This paper addresses the EV fast charging navigation problem using a coupled network weighted pricing approach. The charging navigation problem for each EV is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to minimize comprehensive costs, including time consumption cost and charging cost. Specifically, a novel PTN model based on the multilayer network theory is first proposed, which captures the dynamic characteristics of TN and PDN using extended graphic models and also considers the influence of coupled nodes on the PTN through a coupled weighting matrix. Then, a coupled network weighted charging pricing is developed, considering the dynamic characteristics and interdependence of PTN. To handle the large-scale dynamic complexity of coupled networks, a distributed biased min-consensus algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed navigation strategy, facilitating the optimal operation of “Vehicle-Station-Networks”.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2024.3354300","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U23A20323,62203418); USTC Research Funds of the Double First-Class Initiative(grant numbers:YD2100002011); State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources(grant numbers:LAPS22010); Hefei Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10400956","Electric vehicle;coupled power-transportation networks;fast charging navigation;price mechanism","Navigation;Costs;Roads;Couplings;Routing;Pricing;Vehicle dynamics","","9","","37","IEEE","16 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, building owners investing in V2B infrastructure while generating revenue from V2G services face challenges in planning and coordinating with EV owners due to uncertainties in their schedules and profit-sharing expectations. Additionally, misaligned building and grid peak times can create conflicts between V2B and V2G goals, which may negatively impact the building electricity bill. Unlike previous studies that used a contract-free approach for aggregating V2B and V2G, resulting in inconsistent participation, this article proposes a novel planning and contracting framework that enables building owner to determine the optimal contract parameters with EV owners. These parameters include minimum participation time in DR events, minimum arrival state of charge (SoC), and permitted emergency departure hours. The framework supports V2B aggregation with on-site distributed energy resources (DERs) for DR and V2G services, ensuring transparency and fairness through shared profits and performance-based penalties, while compensating building electricity bills due to V2G activities. The framework is composed of a tri-stage optimization process that uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate EV owner profit assessments, select optimal EV candidates based on charger availability, estimate contract parameters with profit/penalty sharing, and assign contracts between power system operators (PSOs), building owners, and EV owners under multiple virtual scenarios. Simulation results validate the contract parameter assessment and its performance via a 3-day case study with real-world datasets that demonstrates net revenue generation of  ${\$}$ 209 for each EV owner and  ${\$}$ 950 for building owners during DR events with a return on investment (ROI) of 134.5% and 130.7% for the EVs and Building owners, respectively.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2025.3529346","Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) of Ontario, Canada, through a research agreement; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10839413","Contract-based design;demand response (DR);distributed energy resources (DERs);vehicle to building (V2B);vehicle to grid (V2G)","Buildings;Vehicle-to-grid;Electricity;Contracts;Batteries;Costs;Real-time systems;Optimization;Pricing;Degradation","","2","","27","IEEE","13 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the complementarity of power flows amongst AC/DC lines is hardly described and embedded in existing configuration optimization methods in which only the average loading or the variations of loading for a certain period is considered. Solution space will be geometrically increased if operation scenarios are fully simulated for configuration caused by the strong uncertainties of DGs and EVC loads. This paper proposes an analytic quantifiable method to describe the power complementarity between AC/DC lines. The Gaussian mixture model is used to depict the temporal correlation and uncertainties. The complementarity is calculated by the conditional probability of multi-dimensional joint probability density function of AC/DC hybrid lines. Accordingly, an optimal configuration method of hybrid AC/DC distribution network is proposed considering the complementarity of power flows on AC/DC lines, in which the size and location of Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) are optimized.

The nodal criticality is assessed by integrating operational uncertainties of events into samples of Monte Carlo simulation and then classifying load interruptions on the basis of their magnitudes and frequencies. The load shedding due to criticality of system stress is classified into arrays of clusters on the basis of magnitudes of interrupted loads. The critical clusters that provide the largest disturbances to nodal loads are used as the reference capacities of PHEV micro grids to mitigate impacts. Case studies are performed by applying the methodology into a realistic model of a distribution network. Results depict that the proposed methodology can improve the system-wide security of supply.

Another challenge is the heterogeneity in terms of size and supporting capability due to various types of such mobile entities. This work aims to facilitate power-transportation co-optimization by proposing and formalizing the concept of Circulating Loads (CirLoads) to generalize these spatial-temporal dispatchable entities. With the new concept, the stochastic process of CirLoads’ movement is introduced using Brownian particles for the first time. Such novel particle motion-based modeling for EVs can reflect their stochastic behaviors over time without requiring exact data of EVs. The distributions of CirLoads are further aggregated with Gaussian Mixture Models to reduce the dimensions.

Due to rapid industrialization and government incentives for zero-emission transportation, a significant challenge is also constituted in power grids by the self-interested nature of PEVs, with the asymmetry of information between the charging power demand and supply sides. In this paper, we propose an optimal strategy in industrial energy management system, based on evolutionary computing, to characterize different charging situations. The proposed approach considers stochastic, off-peak, peak, and electric power research institute charging scenarios for attaining the vehicle-to-grid capacity in terms of optimal cost and demand. An extensive scheduling of charging cases is studied in order to avoid power outages or scenarios in which there is a significant supply-demand mismatch. Furthermore, the proposed scheme model also reduces the greenhouse gases emission from generation side to build a sustainable generation infrastructure, which maximizes the utility of fuel-based energy production in the presence of certain nonlinear constraints.

To address these environmental challenges, the electrification of transportation systems through Electric Vehicles (EVs) has emerged as a promising solution. However, the successful deployment of EVs hinges on the availability of a robust charging infrastructure capable of meeting the charging demands and extending the driving range of EVs. Nonetheless, the large-scale deployment of EV charging infrastructure presents several challenges, including the ability of the electric grid to supply the required energy to accommodate the charging demand. Moreover, determining the optimal locations for fast-charging stations (FCS) in the traffic network to ensure accessibility, convenience, and efficient resource utilization poses a significant challenge. As a result, numerous studies have investigated the optimal allocation and sizing of EV charging infrastructure. The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive literature review to examine how this optimization problem has been addressed in the literature over the past decade. The review aims to identify the key factors considered in the problem formulation and the optimization techniques for allocating and sizing the charging stations. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA methodology for a comprehensive and unbiased approach. This review contributes to the existing literature by highlighting critical gaps and proposing a framework that can possibly bridge these gaps. The review identifies several critical gaps in current research, including: 1) Transportation-focused studies largely ignore electrical grid constraints; 2) Electrical-focused research often relies on statistically modeled EV charging demand, which may include some geographical assumptions; 3) Multidisciplinary approaches integrating both transportation and electrical networks are still in early stage; 4) Dynamic traffic flow of EVs is rarely considered; 5) Exact optimization methods largely rely on linearized or approximated models; 6) Dominance of approximate methods in transportation and electrical network modeling, primarily relying on evolutionary algorithms; and 7) Hybrid approaches are mainly utilized to solve a specific part of the problem rather than enhancing the quality of the solution. In response to these gaps, the research proposes a novel framework to integrate the transportation network and the electrical grid planning process, offering a holistic and practical solution in FCS infrastructure development.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3381635","Open Access Program with American University of Sharjah; Faculty Research Grant(grant numbers:EN5027:FRG23-C-E21); American University of Sharjah; American University of Sharjah through providing a Graduate Research Assistantship (GTA); Office of Research and Graduate Studies to the Ph.D. Program in Engineering Systems Management; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10478920","Allocation;fast charging station;optimization;power flow;transportation electrification","Reviews;Resource management;Optimization;Transportation;Systematics;Electric vehicle charging;Mathematical models;Fast charging stations;Load flow;Electrification","","10","","123","CCBYNCND","25 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While traditional approaches of assigning conventional generation units to maintain system stability can increase operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, or give signals for new investments, utilizing intelligent control of distributed sources might mitigate those negative effects. This can be achieved by controllable charging of domestic electric vehicles. On the other hand, increasing number of public charging stations gives final users the opportunity to fast charge, making their vehicles an additional source of uncertainty rather than a provider of flexibility. This paper brings a full system assessment of combined effect of slow home charging of electric vehicles together with fast charging stations (both with and without integrated energy storage systems), cast as mixed integer linear programming unit commitment model. The contributions of this paper look into optimal periods when fast charging is beneficial for the system operation, as well as assess the benefits of integrating battery storage into fast charging stations to mitigate the negative effects to power system operation.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2017.2730234","Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost; SUstainable ConCept for integration of distributed Energy Storage Systems; Electric Vehicles Battery Swapping Station(grant numbers:IP-2014-09-3517); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8002578","Ancillary services;battery storage system;electric vehicles (EVs);fast charging stations (FCS);power system flexibility;reserve provision","Nickel;Mathematical model;Electric vehicles;Partial discharges;Charging stations;Power system stability","","37","","47","IEEE","4 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, fast charging behaviors would cause degradations in EVs’ batteries, as well as negative effects like new demand peak and feeder overloads to the connected distribution network, especially when plugging in large scale EVs. Decentralized coordination is encouraged and our goal is to achieve an optimal strategy profile for EVs in a decentralized way considering both the need of fast charging and reducing degradations in batteries and the distribution network. In this article, we innovatively model the EV fast charging problem as an optimization coordination problem subject to the coupled feeder capacity constraints in the distribution network. The need of fast charging is expressed by the total charging time, and the relative tendency to fully charge within the desired time period. We introduce a  $\ell _{0}$ -norm of the charging strategy which is non-convex to represent the total charging time, and apply the  $\ell _{1}$ -norm minimization to approximate the sparse solution of  $\ell _{0}$ -norm minimization. The shorter the charging horizon is the stronger willing of fast charging the user has. The objective of the optimization problem tradeoffs the EVs’ battery degradation cost, the load regulation in the distribution network, the satisfaction of charging and the total charging time, which is non-separable among individual charging behaviors. Even though alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely applied in distributed optimization with separable objective and coupled constraints, its decentralized scheme cannot be applied directly to the underlying non-separable EV charging coordination problem. Hence, a hierarchical algorithm based on ADMM is proposed such that the convergence to the optimal strategies is guaranteed under certain step-size parameter. Furthermore, a receding horizon based algorithm is proposed considering the forecast errors on the base demand and the EV arrival distribution. The results are demonstrated via some simulation results.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3015122","National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) of China(grant numbers:61873303); Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young Scholars; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9173788","Electric vehicles;constrained distribution network;fast charging;non-separable objective;alternating direction method of multipliers;gradient projection;hierarchical algorithm;convergence","Distribution networks;Batteries;Electric vehicle charging;Optimization;Convex functions;Degradation;Convergence","","58","","47","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a multistage system framework to account for an integrated EV dynamic wireless charging system in a smart city. First of all, an optimal placement strategy for PTs is developed based on city traffic information and EV energy demand. Then, having the optimal locations of PTs through the previous stage approach, the proposed dynamic V2G scheduling scheme is formulated to coordinate the schedules of EVs with the provision of daytime V2G ancillary services.

However, the use of EVs for V2G reactive power compensation increases the second-order harmonic ripple current component at the DC-side of the charger. For single-phase, single-stage EV chargers, the ripple current component has to be supplied by the EV battery, unless a ripple compensation method is employed. Additionally, continuous usage of EV chargers for reactive power compensation, when the EV battery is not charging from the grid, exposes the EV battery to these undesirable ripple current components for a longer period and discharges the battery due to power conversion losses. This paper presents a way to provide V2G reactive power compensation through a boost inverter-based single stage EV charger and a DC-side capacitor without adversely affecting the EV battery. The operation of the boost inverter-based EV charger with second-order harmonic and switching frequency ripple current reduction, the dynamic behavior of the system, the transition between different operating modes, the DC-side capacitor voltage control above a minimum allowed voltage, and the DC-side capacitor sizing are extensively analyzed.

The DLMP through QP instead of linear programing as studied in previous literatures solves the multiple solution issue of the aggregator optimization which may cause the decentralized congestion management by DLMP to fail. It is proven in this paper, using convex optimization theory, the aggregator's optimization problem through QP is strictly convex and has a unique solution.

In addition, the generation company (GENCO) manages the charging time of PEVs parked in the parking lots to defer the more expensive and pollutant generation units, and as a result maximize its daily profit. In both planning and operation problems, the behavioral model of PEVs' drivers are modeled with respect to the value of incentive and their distance from the parking lots.

However, the mismatch of the RE generation pattern and load profile introduces the imbalance between energy supply and demand, posing challenges to modern smart grids. While RE generation is inherently less controllable, the emergence of controllable loads, particularly electric vehicles (EVs) with their flexible charging and discharging capabilities, offers a promising solution to dynamically adjust energy consumption to match RE availability. To this end, this paper proposes a RE following mechanism for EV aggregator (EVA), enabling coordinated charging and discharging of EVs. First, we mathematically quantify the aggregated flexibility of EVs using an affine transformation of convex polytopes. This approach improves computational efficiency and accuracy in aggregating individual heterogeneous EV flexibility with different parameters. Then, a RE following mechanism for the EVA is formulated, treating the quantified EV flexibility set as an operating envelope. Two RE following evaluation methods, namely, Euclidean norm and cosine similarity, are used to assess the RE following effectiveness.

In this regard, after modeling involving random variables, a novel hybrid method, based on the Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) optimization algorithm and sequential Monte Carlo simulation is presented. The purpose of the presented optimal charge/discharge schedule is to control the rate and time of charging/discharging of EVs. In the proposed model, various battery operation strategies, including Uncontrolled Charging Mode (UCM), Controlled Charging Mode (CCM), and Smart Charge/Discharge Mode (SCDM) are also considered. In the next step, in order to implement the charge/discharge schedule of the EVCS profitably, a new formulation is presented for the allocation of two EVCSs (administrative and residential EVCS). In the proposed formulation, various objective functions such as power loss reduction, reducing power purchases from the upstream network, reducing voltage deviation in buses, improving reliability is addressed. Moreover, to incentivize the owner to construct the EVCS with adopted charging/discharging schedule, the optimal profits sharing between Distribution System Operator (DSO) and EVCS owner is also performed.

When electricity consumption at power grid demand-side sharply increases/decreases, charging points (CPs) access these sensors by multicast technology to aggregate the EVs' battery status, publish electricity regulation requests and assign the state of charge (SOC) transition instructs in vehicle-to-grid (V2G). However, intermittent connections arising from distributed and mobile energy storage bring many challenging problems on multicast scheduling. First, in smart grid, peak shaving and load shifting require V2G to sense and regulate the EVs' SOC according to their battery status precisely, while the traditional multicast only considers their mutable network locations (e.g., WLAN, IP, and MAC). Second, as the number of EVs that participate into V2G increases, V2G needs to schedule the massive multicast traffic with priority to satisfy the dynamic and real-time regulation requirements. To address these problems, in this paper, we first aim to demonstrate that the appreciable battery status is more adaptive than network location to act as a multicast primitive in V2G. We propose a battery status sensing software-defined multicast (BSS-SDM) scheme to reduce the latency of V2G regulation services. In the BSS-SDM scheme, the battery status of each EV is identified during SOC transitions and maintained by a centralized controller. Besides, we propose a battery-status-based multicast scheduling algorithm to implement the V2G regulation optimization. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of proposed schemes.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2017.2731971","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571300,61401273,61431008,61372049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7993027","Smart grid;battery status;vehicle-to-grid (V2G);state of charge (SOC);software-defined multicast","Batteries;Sensors;State of charge;IEC Standards","","25","","33","OAPA","26 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This does not prevent deep discharges of the battery, which are critical to the lifetime of the battery. In this paper, the ratings of the battery and ultracapacitors are investigated. Comparisons of the system volume, the system mass, and the lifetime of the battery due to the rating of the energy storage devices are presented.

Then, in the second stage, a real-time model predictive control (RT-MPC) is proposed to track the day-ahead dispatch plan using flexibility from EVCSs and other controllable resources (e.g., batteries). The dispatch plan accounts for the uncertainties of vehicles connected to the EVCS along with other uncontrollable power injections, by day-ahead predicted scenarios. The RT-MPC accounts for the uncertainty of the power injections of stochastic resources (such as demand and generation from photovoltaic – PV plants) by short-term forecasts.

To measure the power support effect of EVs, an agent-based model (ABM) estimates EV aggregation for V2G response, considering key factors such as EV number, type, self-interested decision-making, behaviors, and traffic conditions. By integrating these parameters at macro and micro levels, agents interact with one another, including EVs, charging stations (CSs), CS aggregators, DN operators, and personalized trip advisors (PTAs). PTA navigates EVs to locate the nearest CS.

This study analyzes the reliability of aggregated EVCSs based on their aggregation level using an average-based Customer Baseline Load (CBL) method, performance metrics such as RRMSE and RMAE, and a two-stage random sampling approach. The analysis utilizes load data from 873 EVCSs located in Jeju, Korea, as of 2023. The results show that as the level of aggregation increases, both RRMSE and RMAE decrease, significantly reducing CBL estimation errors. Furthermore, it was confirmed that aggregating EVCSs beyond 10 MW of capacity or 500kWh of average hourly load achieves reliability levels comparable to those of traditional DR resources.

The motivation behind our work is to offer guidelines for charging service providers to determine proper charging prices and manage electricity to balance the competing objectives of improving profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on power grid in spite of these uncertainties. We propose a new metric to assess the impact on power grid without solving complete power flow equations. To protect service providers from severe financial losses, a safeguard of profit is incorporated in the model. Two algorithms-stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm and greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm)-are applied to derive the pricing and electricity procurement policy. A Pareto front of the multi-objective optimization is derived. Simulation results show that using SDP algorithm can achieve up to 7% profit gain over using greedy algorithm.

Mobile charger decouples EV charging requirement from parking requirement. A Markov chain model is developed to describe the mobile charger operation in a parking facility, which is shared by EVs and non-EVs with stochastic arrivals and departures. The model is used to study performance of the charger, in terms of system throughput, charging delay, and blocking probability. Accuracy of the proposed model has been verified through extensive simulations. It is found that the maximum throughput of a mobile charger is dependent only on the effective charging powers, which may be affected by the size of parking facility.

We first develop a systemic network dimension reduction technique to virtually cluster the agents and lower the dimension of network-induced constraints and then constitute a novel shrunken primal-multi-dual subgradient (SPMDS) algorithm based on the reduced-dimension network for strongly coupled convex optimization problems. Optimality and convergence of the proposed distributed optimization framework are rigorously proved. The SPMDS-based optimization framework is free of agent-to-agent or cluster-to-cluster communication. Besides, the proposed method can achieve significant floating-point operations (FLOPs) reduction compared with full-dimension cases. The efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approaches are demonstrated, in comparison with benchmark methods, through simulations of electric vehicle charging control problems and traffic congestion control problems.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2022.3143115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9701843","Cooperative optimization;dimension reduction;distributed algorithms;electric vehicle (EV) charging control;multi-agent systems","Optimization;Scalability;Convergence;Electric vehicle charging;Distributed algorithms;Dimensionality reduction;Multi-agent systems","","13","","52","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Integrating charging facilities, especially high-power chargers in fast charging stations, into power distribution systems remarkably alters the traditional load flow pattern, and thus imposes great challenges on the operation of distribution network in which controllable resources are rare. On the other hand, provided with appropriate incentives, the energy storage capability of electric vehicle offers a unique opportunity to facilitate the integration of distributed wind and solar power generation into power distribution system. The above trends call for thorough investigation and research on the interdependence between transportation system and power distribution system. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on this line of research. The basic models of transportation system and power distribution system are introduced, especially the user equilibrium model, which describes the vehicular flow on each road segment and is not familiar to the readers in power system community. The modelling of interdependence across the two systems is highlighted. Taking into account such interdependence, applications ranging from long-term planning to short-term operation are reviewed with emphasis on comparing the description of traffic-power interdependence.

Today, public PEV charging station utilization is typically around 15%. When un-utilized, the chargers are either idle or occupied by a fully charged PEV that has not departed. We call this “overstay.” This motivates a strategy for increasing utilization by interchanging fully charged PEVs with those waiting for service-an issue which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Thus, this article studies the PEV charging station planning problem taking strategic interchange into account. To our best understanding, this has not been studied in the literature. With interchange, the objective is to enhance the charger utilization rate and, thus, reduce the number of chargers. This potentially reduces the capital investment and operational cost. A novel power/energy aggregation model is proposed, and a chance-constrained stochastic programming planning model with interchange is developed for a public charging station to incorporate customer demand uncertainties. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that incorporating strategic interchange operation can significantly decrease the number of chargers, enhance utilization and economic efficiency.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2019.2955997","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1746858); Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:SKL-IOTSC-2018-2020); Start-Up Research Grant of University of Macau(grant numbers:SRG2019-00162-IOTSC); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515012023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8913634","Chance constraints;charging station planning;interchange;plug-in electric vehicle (PEV);stochastic programming (SP)","Planning;Charging stations;Aggregates;Investment;Quality of service;Data models;Informatics","","39","","29","IEEE","26 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To maximize the efficiency of the IPT system used for EV charging and sufficient shielding, this study first analyzed the equivalent circuit model of the IPT system. A 3-D model of an IPT system, with a steel plate and aluminum shielding, is established and investigated in the finite-element analysis (FEA) domain, in which the shielding structure is modeled with some parametric sizes to simplify the modification of the parameters on a shielding structure. The simulation result shows how the ohmic loss on coils and the iron loss on steel plate changes after adding the shielding structure. Afterward, a practical method for optimizing aluminum shielding structure's parameters is proposed to maximize the efficiency of the IPT system, taking iron losses in a steel part and aluminum shielding into account. Furthermore, considering that the optimization procedure becomes complex since the different resonant capacitances are required due to the variable inductances, a new efficiency calculation method by FEA is presented to simplify the optimization procedure.

However, daily charging of EVs, in particular rapid charging, may impact power systems, especially during peak hours, and the effects may occur in different places as traffic conditions change. To address these issues, we describe an integrated rapid-charging navigation strategy that considers both the traffic conditions and the status of the power grid. The system is based on an intelligent transport system (ITS), and contains four modules: a power system control center (PSCC), an ITS center, charging stations, and EV terminals. The PSCC calculates the available charging capacity and station charging capacity based on power grid data and transmits the results to the charging stations. The charging stations determine their charging plans and estimate the available charging power for future EVs (CPFE), and transmit these data to the ITS center. After receiving CPFE data and traffic data from the ITS center, the EV terminal estimates the total time for charging (TTC) for different stations, which includes the driving time, waiting time, and charging time. The driver can view these results and choose to be navigated to the charging station corresponding to the minimum TTC. The modular design of the navigation system reduces data transmission, which protects the drivers' privacy since they can choose which charging station to use and are not required to send any data to the ITS system. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for different working conditions for power system and traffic conditions.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2309961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6805663","Charge;distribution network;electric vehicle (EV);traffic control","Navigation;Vehicles;Real-time systems;Optimization;Power grids;Batteries","","171","","59","IEEE","25 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In Part I, we first present a new method to calculate the charging load of PEVs with a modified Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method for handling the stochastic property of PEVs. We then propose a new two-stage optimization model to discover the optimal charging states of PEVs in a given day. Using this model, the peak load with charging load of PEVs is minimized in the first stage and the load fluctuation is minimized in the second-stage with peak load being fixed as the value obtained in the first stage. An algorithm based on linear mixed-integer programming is provided as a suitable solution method with fast computation. Finally, we present a new method to calculate the benefit and cost for a PEV charging and discharging coordination strategy from a social welfare approach.

All of these changes are against the status quo and introduce new paradigms in the way the power systems operate. The generation penetrates distribution networks, renewables introduce intermittency, and liberalized markets need more competitive operation with the existing assets.

On one hand, such PLOs aim at managing their EVs within their parking lots to participate in the distribution markets and to maximize their profits. On the other hand, a distribution system operator seeks to minimize the system-wide cost while minimizing renewable power spillage and the side-effects of its intermittency. This interaction inspires the innovative two-level model proposed in this paper. In the first level, a new model is proposed for EV PLOs which models the EVs’ characteristics, including EV owners’ uncertainties, in a reasonably accurate manner. These PLOs are allowed to participate in energy, reserve and regulation distribution markets by optimally managing their EVs. In the second level, a new model is developed to ensure that the technical constraints in the distribution networks are met while minimizing the overall system cost.

Specifically, to realize data acquisition and decision-making output, we first characterize the EV charging and traveling behavior as the dynamic interaction process of graph-structured networks. A graph convolutional network is used to extract the environment information required for EVCN, and the generated environment feature is fed into the underlying network of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which can help the agent better understand massive graph-structured data. Then, the real-time navigation problem is duly formulated as a finite Markov decision process. A sequential scheduling pattern is built according to the sorting of EV charging urgency and solved by a Rainbow-based DRL algorithm.

During power outages, especially for elongated time spans, the locally available energy may not be sufficient to fulfill the energy needs of all the EVs. Therefore, a multicriteria EV prioritization scheme is proposed in this study to fairly allocate available energy among EVs during power outages. The five major factors considered for EV prioritization are trip purpose, EV occupants, energy gap, departure time, and customer behavior. With different combinations of the five prioritization factors, three indices are formulated, one each for social welfare, community wellbeing, and individual satisfaction of the EV owners. To this end, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated, based on the three indices, to allocate the available power among EVs with higher index values. The formulated multiobjective optimization problem is solved using the lexicographic method, which has superior performance over the conventionally used weighted-sum method and  $\varepsilon $ -constraint (EC) method. The proposed method is not sensitive to the weights of individual functions and has the ability to handle multiple priority levels. In order to quantify the results, percent served and unserved indices are formulated for each of the three parameters (social welfare, community wellbeing, and individual satisfaction) and the results of the proposed method are compared with those of the weighted-sum method and the EC method. Sensitivity analysis of different uncertain factors, such as number of EVs, uncertainty in EV demand, uncertainty in renewable power, and error in battery state-of-charge estimation, is also carried out.

The relationship between the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and the corresponding total charging demand within a zone is studied, which does not require changing the charging prices to estimate elasticity. To evaluate the shifting of charging demands in different periods and zones, a conditional random field (CRF) model is built, which depicts the spatiotemporal correlations of charging demands. In this model, the VWAPs and the total charging demands are taken as observed variables and hidden variables, respectively. The loopy belief propagation algorithm is used to infer the loopy graph approximately, and the learning algorithm with forgetting factors is used to estimate the unknown parameters of the CRF model.

This equilibrium encapsulates the driver’s choices of route, departure time, and charging location, and the electricity price. In the TN, a dynamic traffic model with point queues is proposed to describe the spatial and temporal evolution of traffic flows that is congruent with established user equilibrium choices. In particular, the queues formed at charging stations are, for the first time, modeled by a point queue. In the PDN, the electricity prices are accurately determined from a second-order conic program with a guarantee of strong duality. After theoretically proving the existence of an equilibrium solution, an improved fixed-point algorithm based on extrapolation is also proposed to solve the equilibrium problem efficiently.

Since the delays affect frequency regulation performance, in order to consider the delay effect on regulation performance, we enhance the conventional load frequency control model by including multiple EV aggregators with varying delays. Under this model, we evaluate the effect of delays in EV aggregators' domain on their profits under two ISOs' mileage payments such as PJM and NYISO. Through simulations, it is shown that the profit of EV aggregators increases as the delays increases.

In this article, an energy sharing model in the forms of hydrogen and electricity is proposed. In this integrated sharing system, besides the aggregators who own power-to-gas (P2G) devices, plug-in hybrid electric and hydrogen vehicles (PH2EVs) aggregators become the new coupling points of the electricity network and gas network, because they can either consume electricity or hydrogen. In the objective function, the total social welfare considering energy dispatch in different systems is maximized. The distributed optimization method is applied to solve the formulated problem. In this way, the privacy of each aggregator can be protected. When the aggregator solves its sub-problem, it is not necessary to obtain all the system information. Besides, the computational complexity is reduced through the distributed optimization. Simulations are conducted on a 35-bus electricity network coupled with a 15-bus gas network. The simulation results reveal that the sharing amount of different kinds of energy can be obtained and the unified market clearing prices of each kind of energy can be achieved. It can be concluded that with the integrated energy sharing of hydrogen and electricity, the total system cost is the lowest and the largest total social welfare can be reached.

To reduce the computational complexity, a linear power flow approximation is utilized. The stochastic environment captures multiple uncertainties arising from the mobility behavior including stochastic daily trip distances, arrival and departure times. Knowledge about the probability distributions of these parameters is used to hedge risks regarding the cost of charging, network overloading, voltage violation, and charging reliability. The results on a test network provide an insight into the impact of uncertainty and the effectiveness of addressing aspects of risk during optimization.

To enhance charging station’s utilization and save corresponding investment costs by incorporating coordinated charging, a new charging spot model, namely single output multiple cables charging spot (SOMC spot), is designed in this paper. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for planning a public parking lot charging station equipped with SOMC spots. The first stage of the programming model is planning of SOMC spots and its objective is to obtain an optimal configuration of the charging station to minimize the station’s equivalent annual costs, including investment and operation costs. The second stage of the programming model involves a probabilistic simulation procedure, in which coordinated charging is simulated, so that the influence of coordinated charging on the planning is considered. A case study of a residential parking lot charging station verifies the effectiveness of the proposed planning model. And the proposed coordinated charging for SOMC spots shows great potential in saving equivalent annual costs for providing charging services.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2517026","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51477082); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390308","Plug-in electric vehicle;charging facility planning;single output multiple cables charging spot;coordinated charging","Planning;Charging stations;Investment;Power cables;Switches;Real-time systems;Load modeling","","134","","43","IEEE","25 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to test the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm, a case study was set up. The connection of 300 PEVs to the Conseil International des Grands Réseaux Électriques (CIGRÉ) European low voltage benchmark network has been simulated. The proposed algorithm has been compared with a nonoptimal charging strategy, which assigns a flat charging profile by dividing the energy requested by the desired recharge time.

Reactive power management is a key aspect that may substantially affect the efficiency and the quality of supply of distribution networks and, as a consequence, the operation of a distribution company (DisCo). This work proposes the integration of an enhanced version of a practical and transparent nodal reactive power pricing scheme into a precise and complete short-term operation model of a DisCo. This model explicitly considers distribution-network-related technical constraints such as dispatchable and intermittent distributed generation units, voltage-sensitive loads, time-varying retail prices, stationary batteries, step voltage regulators, shunt capacitor banks, and demand-related constraints. The resulting model is characterized as a large-scale highly nonlinear and nonconvex program with continuous, binary, and discrete variables.

This paper proposes a novel comprehensive probabilistic approach to calculate the parking lot power and energy for battery and hybrid electric vehicles. At first, a decision is made for the operation mode of an EV arriving at the PL, using an algorithm considering ten influential random variables. Then, the aggregated parking lot power and energy are determined using Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the Gaussian Mixture Model is used to estimate the parameters of the output probability density functions, where the maximum likelihood estimation is employed to find model components. The proposed approach is applied to a sample parking lot, and its performance is demonstrated by comparing it to a base case study and one of the pioneering techniques introduced in the literature.

A novel coordinated long-term planning model of integrated power and transportation system (IPTS) at the regional scale is proposed to simulate the power system balance and travel demand balance simultaneously, while subject to a series of constraints, such as CO2 emission constraints. IPTS of Texas was investigated considering various CO2 emission cap scenarios.

When the power system reaches ultralow carbon intensity, the IPTS then focuses on the road transportation system decarbonization. The results show that with the P2G system, IPTS of Texas could achieve 100% CO2 emission reductions (relative 2018 emissions level) by adding a combination of approximately 143.5 GW of wind, 50 GW of solar PV, and 40 GW of P2G systems with 2.5% renewables curtailment.

On the one hand, EV can relieve the peak load of a smart grid and improve the electricity system operation. On the other hand, EV’s electricity trading information can provide useful data for vehicle management departments to electricity scheduling. However, hackers can easily obtain data from the central database to simulate both parties involved, which leads to the receiver getting unauthorized information. For these challenges, we propose a novel secure electricity trading and incentive contract model based on the basic rules of China’s electricity market. The digital signature technology adopts elliptic curve bilinear pairing to guarantee the reliability and integrity of the transaction information. Energy blockchain is utilized for encryption and distributed storage of energy data with the possession of tamper-proof and traceability. The consistency part of the data block applies a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant (PBFT) algorithm, which not only increases transaction throughput but also reduces transmission delay. The incentive contract based on revenue rewards can promote the benign interaction of EVs. The security analysis reveals that this scheme can achieve better results. Compared with other schemes, our scheme saves about 64.55% of the communication overhead and validates the same number of signed messages in a shorter time. Incentive contracts based on game theory can facilitate EV electricity trading through energy coin rewards.

An emergent contributor to global decarbonisation is green hydrogen. Green hydrogen can remove or reduce the burden of electrification of heat and transport on energy networks and provide a sustainable energy resource. In this paper, we explore how to optimally design a standalone hybrid green power system (HGPS) to supply a specific load demand with on-line charging of Electric Vehicles (EV). The HGPS includes wind turbine (WT) units, photovoltaic (PV) arrays, electrolyser and fuel cell (FC). For reliability analysis, it is assumed that WT, PV, DC/AC converter, and EV charger can also be sources of potential failure. Our methodology utilises a particle swarm optimization, coupled with a range of energy scenarios as to fully evaluate the varying interdependences and importance of economic and reliability indices, for the standalone HGPS. Our analysis indicates that EV charging with peak loading can have significant impact on the HGPS, resulting in significant reductions in the reliability indices of the HGPS, therefore enhance the operation of HGPS and reduces the overall cost.

This includes the prediction of required energy used for charging purposes based on synthetic data and functionalities for optimized energy procurement in the day-ahead energy market to determine the aggregated charging schedule of the fleet. The aggregated charging schedule provides the basis for the proposed charging control algorithm for individual EVs. This algorithm allows for charging flexibility according to the user’s driving preferences while considering data privacy. To avoid data privacy conflicts, the scheduling of the individual charging is decoupled from the upcoming individual driving schedules of the users themselves. This means that the user is not asked to plan and submit expected driving profiles. Instead, realization is by a user-oriented disaggregation that uses the aggregated charging schedule as an input to coordinate the individual charging processes itself. The resulting integrative market solution allows to fulfill the contract positions in energy market participation.

In turn, the resultant growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) calls for the development of a well-designed charging infrastructure. However, an inappropriate placement of charging stations might hamper smooth operation of the power grid and be inconvenient to EV drivers. Thus, the present work proposes a novel two-stage planning model for charging station placement. The candidate locations for the placement of charging stations are first determined by fuzzy inference considering distance, road traffic, and grid stability. The randomness in road traffic is modelled by applying a Bayesian network (BN). Then, the charging station placement problem is represented in a multi-objective framework with cost, voltage stability reliability power loss (VRP) index, accessibility index, and waiting time as objective functions. A hybrid algorithm combining chicken swarm optimization and the teaching-learning-based optimization (CSO TLBO) algorithm is used to obtain the Pareto front. Further, fuzzy decision making is used to compare the Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed planning model is validated on a superimposed IEEE 33-bus and 25-node test network and on a practical network in Tianjin, China.

Under this circumstance, addressing the optimal planning of WCLs while considering SEV operations is crucial for facilitating the widespread adoption of EVs. Considering the uncertain solar power harvesting of SEVs, we propose a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for this integrated planning and operation problem. In the first stage, we optimize the deployment of WCLs with budget constraints, and the second stage determines the optimal operation schedules of SEVs under uncertain solar charging power characterized by a moment-based ambiguity set. To address the computational challenges (due to the discrete variables in both stages and the infinite-dimensional optimization in the second stage), we develop two approximation models and an integrated distributed method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real transportation networks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed models and algorithms. Specifically, the proposed DRO model achieves a 1.17% lower total cost in out-of-sample tests than the sample average approximation method, and with higher wireless charging power rates and increased battery capacities, we can build fewer WCLs.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2025.3562279","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2143679,2404412); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:15503723); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10970087","Integrated planning and operation problem;wireless charging lanes;solar-powered electric vehicles;two-stage distributionally robust optimization","Inductive charging;Roads;Batteries;Anxiety disorders;Uncertainty;Optimization;Transportation;Electric vehicles;Solar powered vehicles;Electric vehicles","","2","","46","IEEE","18 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we first formulate the EV coordinated charging problem with the above multiple objectives as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, a novel interaction model, i.e., communication neural network (CommNet) model, is adopted to realize the distributed computation of global information (namely the electricity price, the transformer load, and the total charging cost of multiple EVs). Moreover, different from the most existing works which make specific constraints on the size, the location, or the topology of the distribution network, what we need in the proposed method is only the transformer load.

The strategic placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) in urban areas is critical to supporting the transition to clean transportation. However, as EV adoption increases, challenges such as rising power losses, voltage profile degradation, and voltage instability emerge within microgrids. These issues can be mitigated by integrating Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) to enhance efficiency. This study presents an integrated planning approach to optimize the allocation of EVCSs based on the spatial-temporal distribution of traffic flows. A stochastic model is also introduced to determine the optimal placement of the energy storage system, accounting for uncertainty factors such as fluctuating electrical loads and the intermittency of renewable energy sources. The energy storage system allocation model is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem aimed at improving voltage profiles, minimizing power losses, and maximizing voltage stability. The mathematical models of EVCSs and ESSs, and an economic analysis of the microgrid is included, considering the costs associated with energy storage system integration. The proposed model’s effectiveness is validated through a case study on a benchmark transportation network, with results indicating its ability to mitigate the negative effects of EV integration on microgrids. Additionally, the study introduces a stochastic framework to simulate the inherent uncertainties in electrical loads and renewable energy sources.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3562531","Qassim University; Deanship of Scientific Research, on the financial support for this research(grant numbers:2023-SDG-1-BSRC35732,1445 AH/ 2023 AD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10969781","Charging infrastructure;charging station;clean energy;electric vehicle;mathematical modeling;optimal allocation;SDG;uncertainty;smart cities","Electric vehicle charging;Voltage;Optimization;Resource management;Costs;Electric vehicles;Distribution networks;Renewable energy sources;Energy storage;Energy loss","","4","","66","CCBY","18 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO. In case studies, we reveal the non-negligible impact of TN condition variations on EV charging distributions. Moreover, numerical results show that sharing high-quality traffic data contributes to the reduction in DSO's operating cost by utmost 20.8% as compared to the current practice without data sharing.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2025.3548435","Natural Science Research Start-up Foundation of Recruiting Talents of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:NY224046); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073173); Key Research & Development Plan of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BE2023838); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10910214","Power system;transportation system;uncertainty;data valuation;cooperative game theory","Costs;Electric vehicle charging;Network topology;Uncertainty;Game theory;Charging stations;Power distribution networks;Demand forecasting","","","","46","IEEE","5 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To maximize satisfied charging requests, given the limited supply capacity, dynamic charging coordination is required to determine suitable CPs for mobile EVs. Charging coordination necessitates EV owners to share their information (i.e., the identities and locations) with charging service providers (CSPs) to allocate the best CP for charging. However, charging coordination raises privacy concerns due to the exchange of private information. Moreover, a fast authentication mechanism is then required between EVs and CPs to initiate the charging process. In addition to the privacy limitation, existing DWC strategies lack the presence of multiple CSPs, which is a crucial aspect given the significant growth of the EV market. Consequently, centralization arises, with a single CSP overseeing the entire network. This paper proposes a semi-decentralized privacy-preserving networking strategy utilizing a specially designed consortium blockchain to support dynamic charging coordination, authentication, and billing while ensuring user anonymity and data unlinkability. Our proposed strategy leverages a novel semi-decentralized K-times group signature scheme and distributed random number generators to achieve privacy and decentralization. Simulation results showed that the proposed method reduces the EV authentication time to 0.1 ms while limiting storage requirements to just 4 MB per block at each EV. Additionally, the proposed strategy showed improved security and privacy features when compared with IBM’s privacy-preserving blockchain (Identity Mixer).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2025.3613876","NSF EPCN(grant numbers:2220346); American University of Sharjah(grant numbers:FRG25-I-E67); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11182607","Blockchain;electric vehicles;dynamic wireless charging;smart grid","Privacy;Authentication;Blockchains;Electric vehicle charging;Data privacy;Vehicle dynamics;Homomorphic encryption;Schedules;Inductive charging;Complexity theory","","","","46","IEEE","26 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, both of them require a better coordination of infrastructure system and renewable energy resources to achieve a significant reduction of GHG emissions. This article aims to maximize the long-term profitability for the planning model of hydrogen refueling stations, where the capacitated flow refueling location model is leveraged for maximal traffic flow coverage. Furthermore, we discuss various real-world constraints, such as traffic network constraints, distribution network constraints, hydrogen balance constraints, and energy constraints for electric vehicles, to make the planning model more practical. By considering the uncertainty of the short-term refueling demand across the city, an approach for geographically redistributing hydrogen among the stations is also presented where the minimal cost of redistribution is modeled by one-commodity pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem.

In each fixed time interval, each microgrid can be an energy provider or a consumer according to their energy generation and local demand. Under the trading mechanism, there is a distributor which gathers the surplus energy from providers and distributes it to the consumers based on the consumers' historical contribution level. To design the trading mechanism, a novel contribution-based energy allocation policy (EAP) is proposed. Each consumer who knows this distribution rule decides the amount of requesting energy in order to maximize its utility, i.e., the quantity of energy it will receive. Finally, the economic benefits of such trading mechanism are studied by analyzing the decision-making procedures of consumers and distributor. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative energy competition game (ECG) among the consumers. The existence and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium (NE) are shown, and the NE solution is given as a closed form. Also, even though there are foolish consumers which do not take the given NE solution, a consumer which takes the NE solution will not lose out on its utility.

For each candidate location, we first model its coverage area to estimate the dynamic EV charging requirements. Then, we formulate the problem at each time stage as profit maximization, which is a mixed-integer optimization problem. To make it tractable, we investigate the profitability of candidate locations and derive their upper and lower bounds on the expected profit. Then we take two steps to transform and relax the problem to convex optimization. A fastconverging search algorithm, named RMCL-E, is proposed.

Although, the traditional virtual inertia control (VIC) approach can stabilize the DC-bus voltage, its anti-interference ability is still limited. To solve this problem, an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) based VIC control scheme is proposed, wherein the VIC approach provides virtual inertia for the system, and the ADRC is derived and modeled using the first-order virtual inertia equation. The external and uncertain internal disturbances in the system are considered for the total disturbance estimation.

We formalize an operation model for stations incorporating Fixed-chargers and Robo-chargers. Optimal scheduling can be solved with the recognition of the combinatorial nature of vehicle-charger assignments, charging dynamics, and customer waiting behaviors. Then, with operation model nested, we develop a planning model to guide economical investment on both types of chargers so that the total cost of ownership is minimized. In the planning phase, it further considers charging demand variances and service capacity requirements. In this paper, we provide systematic techno-economical methods to evaluate if introducing Robo-chargers is beneficial given a specific application scenario. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on real-world data highlights the advantages of Robo-chargers, especially in a scenario where overstay is severe.

The future energy plans in Denmark aim for 50% wind power capacity integration which will replace many conventional large power plant units. The limited control and regulation power capabilities of large power plants in the future demands for new balancing solutions like vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems.

The forecast errors of EV fleet characteristics, hourly loads, and wind energy as well as random outages of generating units and transmission lines are considered as potential uncertainties, which are represented by scenarios in the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The conditional value at risk (CVaR) index is utilized for measuring EV aggregators risks caused by the uncertainties. The EV aggregators optimal bidding strategy is formulated as a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), in which the upper level problem is the aggregators CVaR maximization while the lower level problem corresponds to the system operation cost minimization. The bi-level problem is transformed into a single-level mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem using the prime-dual formulation with linearized constraints. The progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) is utilized to solve the resulting single-level MILP problem. A game theoretic approach is developed for analyzing the competition among the EV aggregators.

We propose a hierarchical economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme for the operation of the EMS with EV charge management. An aggregator plans the operation of the EMS and an aggregated perspective of the EVCSs. A distributor then allots the aggregated charge power to the individual EVCSs.

Dynamic wireless charging holds promise to partially or completely eliminate the overnight charging through a compact network of dynamic chargers installed on the roads that would keep the vehicle batteries charged at all times, consequently reducing the range anxiety and increasing the reliability of EVs. Dynamic charging can help lower the price of EVs by reducing the size of the battery pack.

Each residential end-user has a base load, two types of adjustable loads, and possibly a storage device. The first load type must consume a specified amount of energy over the scheduling horizon, but the consumption can be adjusted across different slots. The second type does not entail a total energy requirement, but operation away from a user-specified level results in user dissatisfaction. The research issue amounts to minimizing the electricity provider cost plus the total user dissatisfaction, subject to the individual constraints of the loads. The problem can be solved by a distributed subgradient method. The utility company and the end-users exchange information through the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)-a two-way communication network-in order to converge to the optimal amount of electricity production and the optimal power consumption schedule. The algorithm finds near-optimal schedules even when AMI messages are lost, which can happen in the presence of malfunctions or noise in the communications network. The algorithm amounts to a subgradient iteration with outdated Lagrange multipliers, for which convergence results of wide scope are established.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2176518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6168820","Advanced metering infrastructure;demand-side management;distributed algorithms;energy consumption scheduling;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power demand;Load flow control;Convergence;Minimization;Optimization","","182","3","32","IEEE","13 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The EV charging faces many difficulties such as waiting time, charging time, uneven charge scheduling, and uneven distributed charging stations. In Charging Station (CS), EVs usually spend much time in queues, mainly during peak hours of charging. Therefore, building a well-established charging station network should be derived from charging demand and proper charge scheduling to assist EVs for getting charged with less cost, less waiting time. Also, it should reduce the number of vehicles scheduling during the peak load time. This work aims to design a scheduling system for EV charging using an optimization strategy of Chaotic Harris Hawks optimization (CHHO) which reduces the total time spent on charging station and the distance of EV origin to destination. CHHO is authenticated using Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) simulation, and the performances are compared with algorithms Exponential Harris Hawk Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer, First in First Out and Random Allocation to demonstrate the efficacy of our technique. The proposed CHHO-based scheduling system yields better performance with the maximum remaining energy and significantly cuts the average travel time, and improves the utilization rate of EVs in charging stations compared to other algorithms.

However, long charging times and drivers' range anxiety are the main disadvantages of EVs. A key factor that is expected to mitigate these problems and facilitate the wide adoption of EVs will be the effective operation of fast charging stations (FCSs). In this paper, the operation of a FCS is evaluated, in terms of operator's profits and customers' waiting time in the queue. The FCS contains both dc and ac outlets that provide high power levels, while the various EV models are classified by their battery size and the fast charging option they use (dc or ac). The operator's daily profits and the queue waiting time are initially computed by considering that the EVs recharge under a flat-rate pricing policy. In order to avoid a long queue build-up at the FCS, a new pricing policy is then proposed. The intuition behind the scheduled pricing policy is that users are deterred to charge more than an arranged energy threshold, thus reducing the load and the waiting time at the FCS.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2017.2660584","Generalitat de Catalunya(grant numbers:2014-SGR-1551); CellFive(grant numbers:TEC2014-60130-P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835662","Electric vehicles;charging stations;quality of service;queueing analysis","Batteries;Pricing;Random variables;Charging stations;Electric vehicles;Load modeling","","49","","31","IEEE","27 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, it is crucial to comprehensively assess the influence of EV charging load on the distribution system. To mitigate the operational risks and optimize control measures of the power network, a two-stage time series decomposition and BiLSTM deep learning architecture is proposed for accurately predicting EV charging load series. In the first stage, a Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) evaluation method is introduced for assessing the decomposition loss, and the Lion Swarm Optimization (LSO) is employed to determine the optimal combination of decomposition parameters, thereby reducing the empirical parameter randomness and minimizing the signal loss during the decomposition process. Then, Bidirectional Short and Long-term Memory Network model (BiLSTM) is established for forecasting each sub-sequence obtained through the decomposition process.

However, challenges such as limited capacity and stability constraints hinder the widespread adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs). Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) enhance market participation by aggregating DERs, while electric vehicles (EVs) contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing emissions. Additionally, integrating distribution static compensators (DSTATCOMs) within VPPs improves microgrid stability and reactive power support. This study proposes a two-stage optimization approach to enhance network resilience and VPP profitability in a radial distribution network (RDN). The first stage focuses on minimizing resilience-related costs and energy not supplied (ENS) during natural disasters, while the second stage optimizes VPP profit using a three-phase bidding strategy, which includes the day-ahead market, real-time market, and overall market. A hybrid improved grey wolf optimization-particle swarm optimization (IGWO-PSO) algorithm is developed to solve this complex optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, IGWO-PSO is compared with other hybrid optimization algorithms. Validation on a modified IEEE 33-bus RDN confirms that the proposed model enhances VPP placement and sizing, leading to improved economic, operational, and resilience metrics.

The goal of this study is to determine the charging/discharging of PV energy-integrated energy storage system (PV-ESS), EV charging price, and demand response (DR) incentive values considering voltage management. To achieve the optimal energy operation for a distribution network, this study proposes an evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based new scheduling strategy, considering voltage management for a multi-agent system (MAS). The EGT, which is a decision-making strategy, is used by agents to cooperate and derive the best scheduling with their own behavior pattern functions to minimize the system operating cost.

Under DSO supervision, a reward that stabilizes the voltage profile of the power distribution system is also implemented during the cooperation process. The proposed energy scheduling strategy combines an EGT-based decision-making with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the optimization problem and determine the payoff function through self-evolutionary improvement.

Thus, in addition to less overshoot and shorter setting time, the controller of the converter applied in EVDCPS should maintain the system stable. In this article, the finite-time controller (FTC) is proposed based on exact feedback linearization (EFL) to stabilize the EVDCPS feeding CPL. First, to handle the nonlinearity caused by the CPL, the affine nonlinear model of EVDCPS is transformed into the Brunovsky canonical form by using EFL. Then, the finite-time control is adopted and a PI compensator is designed to eliminate the steady-state error. Under the proposed control algorithm, rigorous proofs indicate that not only the closed system can be large-signal stable, but also the EVDCPS bus voltage can converge the reference in finite time. Furthermore, to reduce the design difficulty of FTC, the backstepping method is adopted to design a backstepping finite-time controller(BFTC). Finally, simulations and experiments of FTC and BFTC are carried out. Results indicate that both FTC and BFTC have large-signal stability, and although the robustness of BFTC is inferior to FTC, the setting time and overshoot are greatly improved compared with the traditional linear feedback controller.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2021.3125621","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873343); Key R&amp;D plan of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020ZDLGY06-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606578","Backstepping;constant power load (CPL);dc–dc converter;finite-time control;PI compensator","Power system stability;Stability criteria;Voltage control;Batteries;Backstepping;Lyapunov methods;Damping","","20","","25","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This flexibility promotes the EVs to be good candidates for providing the grid with ancillary services, such as regulation services. A group of EVs controlled by an aggregator can collectively work as a regulation reserve in the electric grid. However, a fast response to the regulation commands is crucial to providing reliable regulation service. Typically, the response time to the regulation command requires to be less than four seconds. In this paper, we precisely evaluate the expected time delay from the instant when an aggregator server sends a regulation command to n EVs to the instant when all the EVs' responses are received successfully by the server. To achieve this goal, first, a realistic communication structure between the aggregator server and the EVs is considered. Second, the wireless link between the access point (AP) and the EVs is accurately modeled in order to estimate the average delay. The model is based on Markov chain representation for the wireless IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. Two important factors are considered in this model. First, the packet loss probability due to the lossy wireless environment has been incorporated into the model. Second, the transition stages for the contention window size of 802.11 MAC protocol to reach the saturation stage is taken into account. The model has been validated by means of extensive simulation using the well-known Network Simulator 2 (NS2) tool. Our analysis shows that one AP is capable of handling up to 1000 EVs without violating the 4-s latency limit when the probability of packet loss is 0.01. However, this number decreases significantly, less than 500 EVs, when the wireless link is experiencing a significant packet loss probability of 0.2. Further, we show that by commanding a subgroup of the charging EVs, it is possible to achieve the same regulation service but with a lesser response time, compared to commanding all charging EVs every time.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2017.2750638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031072","Electric vehicles (EVs);modeling 802.11 MAC;regulation services;response time;smart grid","Delays;Servers;Wireless communication;Time factors;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Packet loss","","17","","26","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the wide variation range of battery voltages, applying conventional LLC resonant converters usually results in relatively larger magnetic size and lower power density. This article presents a novel approach to improve the power density performance of LLC resonant converters for EV charging. It leverages the existing capacitor-clamped LLC topology, which was originally proposed for applications needing overcurrent protection, while innovatively operating the converter in the capacitive (rather than inductive) region of conventional LLC resonant converters. Results in this work using our proposed design method show that when working in the capacitive region, the capacitor-clamped LLC converter can not only realize zero-voltage switching in the MOSFETs and zero-current switching in the output diodes but also significantly reduce the flux linkage requirement in the transformer compared to conventional LLC. This leads to an elegant solution that optimally minimizes the size of magnetics for increased power density while reducing costs. The merits of the capacitor-clamped LLC converter with the proposed design method are validated by a 400 W, 200 V input, 125–210 V output range prototype, which achieves an efficiency of 98.13% at the maximum output power.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2021.3068693","Hong Kong Research(grant numbers:17205817); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE210100473); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385912","Electric vehicle (EV) charging;high power density;  $LLC$   resonant converter;soft switching","Resonant converters;Zero voltage switching;Batteries;Magnetic resonance;Power electronics;Topology;Power system measurements","","15","","24","IEEE","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, the high deployment and operational costs of WCLs raise concerns about their expected utilization and returns on the investment.

In the first stage, the TOPSIS method is utilized to rank several alternative locations according to their geospatial, environmental and technical specifications. The alternatives with the highest ranking are then shortlisted and evaluated using a mathematical BGP model, to provide recommendations on the most optimal locations and the corresponding WCL lengths that meet budget constraints according to the economic evaluation criteria.

Renewable energy (mainly wind and solar) is intermittent and non-dispatchable. The aggregator of available energy storage systems and controllable loads, including heating, cooling, EV charging/discharging, etc., can mitigate those issues in the VPP framework and maintain system balance. The VVP platform's wind speed, solar radiation, and load demand are highly dynamic. Without intelligent coordination, it is impossible to determine the optimal size of the resources with minimum operation cost. An overestimate of resources suffers from unnecessary excess capital cost, which might not be feasible. On the other hand, an underestimate of resources builds an unreliable VPP. It is a multi-objective complex problem considering the minimization of capital and operation costs as objectives, subject to many constraints, including net zero emission. Moreover, an intelligent energy management system (EMS) is deployed considering present and near future dynamic forecasted demand profile, state of charge (SoC) of storage, and power availability from renewables for reliability, and maintains net zero energy and emission. All the dispatch and transaction communications in VPP are committed to using blockchain. This paper uses an intelligent multi-objective strategy to design and optimize a generalized VPP model. Historical wind speed, solar radiation, and load profiles over a long period are used as inputs for the model. An intelligent energy management system for the dispatch of resources is carried out.

This paper develops further the coordinated and frequency level-dependent distributed energy resources (DERs) control and adaptive on-load-tap-changers (OLTCs) management scheme which enables prioritized flexibility services provision for the DSOs and TSO. The key idea of the scheme is that the coordination of flexibility utilisation between DSOs and TSOs is done depending on the severity of the situation from the whole power system’s viewpoint regarding frequency deviation level. During smaller frequency deviations DSOs’ needs are prioritized and during larger frequency deviations priority is on TSO’s needs to support momentarily the stability of the whole power system. The overall target of the studied management scheme is also to increase DERs’, especially photovoltaics’ (PVs’) and electric vehicles’ (EVs’), hosting capacity in the DSOs’ networks and increase DERs availability for the flexibility services provision to the TSO during smaller frequency deviations. In this paper, enhanced OLTC control principles are presented including novel interconnection transformer OLTC control scheme for larger medium-voltage (MV) network-connected DER units. This MV DER OLTC control logic can enable, for example, same DER active power response with 7.7% smaller current or 8.5% higher DER unit active power response with the same current value. In addition, this paper studies the effect of different OLTC control inputs, DER reactive power control settings, LV feeder length and large-scale integration of EVs on low-voltage (LV) network with multiple PSCAD simulations.

PEV charging infrastructure siting must ensure not only a satisfactory charging service for PEV users but also a high utilization and profitability for the chosen facility locations. Thus, the various types of charging facilities should be located based on an accurate location estimation of the potential PEV charging demand. In this paper, we propose a spatial–temporal flow capturing location model. This model determines the locations of various types of charging facilities based on the spatial–temporal distribution of traffic flows. We utilize the dynamic traffic assignment model to estimate the time-varying traffic flows on the road transportation network.

Given that not all $\mu$Gs possess adequate energy storage and distributed energy resources (DERs), we advocate for the mobilization of vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled EVs for equitable and resilient energy access. Our emergency service relocation (ESR) model incentivizes EV owners to transport stored energy between $\mu$Gs. However, traditional DSS cannot promptly solve the associated mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, necessitating a faster solution algorithm for rapid EV deployment under emergency conditions.

Hence, a virtual inertia control (VIC) strategy is proposed to suppress these fluctuations and enhance the stability of the DC-MG. The VIC method is realized in a bidirectional grid-connected converter (BGCC), which combines VIC and model predictive control (MPC). The proposed method can provide inertia support during the transient state and enhance the dynamic characteristics of the DC-link voltage. A prediction model is established that uses the variation range of the DC-link voltage as the constraint, and the output of VIC as well as voltage deviations as optimization objectives. The desired DC-link current increment is calculated using the prediction model to change the input DC current reference of the VIC.

To address this issue, EV charging control strategies have been developed to manage the switch between vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) modes for EVs. In this context, multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has proven its effectiveness in EV charging control. However, existing MADRL-based approaches fail to consider the natural power flow of EV charging/discharging in the distribution network and ignore driver privacy. To deal with these problems, this article proposes a novel approach that combines multi-EV charging/discharging with a radial distribution network (RDN) operating under optimal power flow (OPF) to distribute power flow in real time. A mathematical model is developed to describe the RDN load. The EV charging control problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) to find an optimal charging control strategy that balances V2G profits, RDN load, and driver anxiety. To effectively learn the optimal EV charging control strategy, a federated deep reinforcement learning algorithm named FedSAC is further proposed. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of the diversity of the charging control strategy, the power fluctuations on RDN, the convergence efficiency, and the generalization ability.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3306826","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:21ZR1442700); Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:22YF1428500); Open Research Fund of Engineering Research Center of Software/Hardware Co-Design Technology and Application, Ministry of Education (East China Normal University); Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan Project(grant numbers:CJGJZD20210408092400001); Swiss National Science Foundation under the NCCR Automation(grant numbers:51NF40_180545); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10225344","Electrical vehicle (EV);federated learning (FL);optimal power flow (OPF);reinforcement learning;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Electric vehicle charging;Distribution networks;Vehicle-to-grid;Load flow;Optimization;Anxiety disorders;Upper bound","","25","","57","IEEE","21 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To incentivize EVs to trade charging/discharging energy, auction theory is employed to guarantee three economic properties: 1) truthfulness; 2) individual rationality; and 3) social cost minimization. The mechanism is designed according to the topology of an active distribution system, in which multiple microgrids (MGs) are networked through a distribution network (DN). Two types of V2G auctions are proposed for the MG and DN, respectively. In each auction, the auctioneer optimizes control of EVs' charging/discharging by solving a social cost minimization problem subject to constraints of power network topology. Further, the mechanism uses analytic target cascading framework, allowing the MG and DN to set up their own V2G auctions separately, and meanwhile enabling them to coordinate with each other to determine DN-MG power exchange. It is theoretically proved that the mechanism's three economic properties hold in both the cases of grid-tied MGs and islanding MGs. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can regulate voltages of the distribution system to a secure range.

To create comprehensive and resilient battery swapping stations, a two-stage optimization with recourse is proposed. In the planning stage, the investment for battery purchases is recommended even before the EV station visit uncertainties are made known. In the operation stage, the battery allocation decisions, such as charging, discharging, and swapping are then coordinated. To apply the recourse strategy in creating representative scenarios, the EV station visit distribution techniques are also proposed using a modified K-means clustering method. Aside from the sensitivity analysis made with swapping prices and charging intervals, the strategy comparisons with conventional strategies have also demonstrated the practicality of the BSS coordination to future electricity and transportation networks.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2019.2905898","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51777132); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0904700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8684280","Electric vehicles;battery swapping stations (BSSs);optimization with recourse","Batteries;Uncertainty;Planning;Optimization;Investment;Resource management;Electric vehicles","","89","","42","IEEE","9 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A far-reaching change-one could say a revolution-in power systems is indeed ongoing; designing and implementing smart grids is not an option but an absolute necessity. If we do not do it, or if we do it too slowly, we will face major problems. To prepare, European DSOs are massively investing in R&D and demonstration projects in cooperation with the information communications technology (ICT) industry, acquiring the knowledge and skills needed to adapt and lead. Smart grids have the potential to benefit the whole value chain, but the market model must be defined. Whatever the preferred model, DSOs will have a key role to play as market enablers. DSOs will be responsible for setting up the playing field for retailers and aggregators so that it works for the benefit of customers. DSOs will increasingly act as local system operators. Well-organized active distribution system management will make it possible to reduce the investments needed to host renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging stations and will guarantee security and quality of supply. Enhancing the “smartness” of distribution grids is not free of charge. It will require significant capex on the DSO side, while the benefits from those investments will accrue throughout the entire value chain. The development of business models, with the strong support of policy makers and regulators, is necessary to ensure that all parties share the risks, costs, and benefits of smart grids. Bringing smart grids from vision to reality will only happen if smart regulation is introduced. Last but not least, a key objective of European DSOs is to make sure that the new solutions that will be implemented are designed to benefit all customers.","1558-4216","","10.1109/MPE.2013.2294512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742701","","Europe;Power grids;Electricity supply industry;Power distribution planning;Power system planing;Power markets;Power generation;Business","","54","","","IEEE","17 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, the additional conversion stage for integrating the BSS increases the system losses, size, and cost. The concept of a partial power processing converter (PPPC) can mitigate this effect. Compared to conventional used full power processing converter (FPPC), PPPC reduces the amount of transferred power from the BSS to the electric vehicle (EV) by the converter. As a consequence, the power losses generated by the converter are reduced, leading to lower sized converters and higher system efficiencies. This article proposes a dc/dc multiport converter that allows the integration of battery storage in FCS based on a partial power processing concept while maintaining the specific requirements in terms of isolation for FCS. The proposed three-port partial power processing converter (3P-PPPC) is derived from the commonly used triple active bridge (TAB) converter. The resulting design tradeoffs, the dynamic behavior, and limitations of the topology are investigated. Furthermore, the round-trip efficiency of the 3P-PPPC for integrating BSS in FCS is compared with conventional FPPC solutions, highlighting the superiority of the proposed topology.

Towards such issues, we propose an efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning based methodology for constraint-based routing while simultaneously considering electric vehicles’ charging policies. We design a two-layer model to find near-optimal solutions and handle the broad range of problem instances according to the rewards and the preset feasibility rules. The first layer is to approximate a sequence of consecutive actions in reality and correspondingly produce a minimum time-consuming feasible route without re-training for each new problem instance. The second layer is to generate a charging scheme along the previously generated feasible path. The proposed methodology is independent of the road network topology and the electric vehicles’ types. Besides, the convergence of value function in the presented model for EVRP is studied.

The power consumption characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible and easily controllable, which will also affect the sizing of power generation system. This paper presents a methodology for the joint capacity optimization of a typical residential standalone microgrid (MG) employing RE sources, i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WTs), diesel generators (DGs), and battery energy storage system (BESS). The MG supplies a residential community load comprising of typical residential load plus electric vehicles (EVs) charging load. The realistic mathematical models of PV, WT, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load are formulated to improve the capacity optimization methodology, which involves various realistic constraints associated with the RE sources, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load. The labyrinthine optimization problem is formulated and solved innovatively to 1) minimize the cost; 2) reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; and 3) curtail dump energy. All three objectives have special significance in designing a standalone MG, for example, cost is related to the economics, GHG emissions deal with global warming, and dump energy is related to the stability and economics of the system. The optimization problem is solved for different possible combinations of PV, WT, DG, and BESS to determine the best possible combination to serve the load effectively and economically. In addition, the impact of load shifting on the sizes of distributed generators and BESS in terms of per-unit cost and GHG emissions is analyzed using the concept of controllable loads.

In the CTD model, A stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment problem (SUE-TAP) with elastic traffic demand and discrete path selection of drivers is formulated to capture the traffic flow distribution comprised of EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs). An alternative current optimal power flow (ACOPF) model of PDN is utilized to provide the optimal charging price and scheduling plan.

The increasing demand for lower weight and higher conversion efficiency is opening new challenges, encouraging the adoption of new technologies (e.g., wide bandgap semiconductor devices). In particular, the DC-link capacitor typically represents the bulkiest inverter component, posing a strict limitation to the achievable converter power density and thus being subject to great pressure for improvement. In this context, novel ceramic capacitor technologies (e.g., PLZT) promise superior performance with respect to well established film-based solutions, featuring both higher specific capacitance and higher RMS current capability. Therefore, this article focuses on the analysis, sizing, design, and experimental assessment of a PLZT-based ceramic DC-link capacitor for next-generation EV drive inverters, including a comparative assessment with a state-of-the-art film-based solution. In particular, in view of the non-linear behavior of the PLZT capacitance value with respect to the DC-bias voltage and the amplitude of the excitation, a novel correlation between the effective large-signal capacitance and the peak-to-peak voltage ripple is derived experimentally, providing useful information for the DC-link capacitor sizing (i.e., not available from the capacitor manufacturer). For verification purposes, a full-scale DC-link capacitor prototype for a SiC MOSFET 800 V, 550 kVA, and 20 kHz drive inverter is realized, demonstrating superior power density (i.e., $\approx$ two thirds smaller and $\approx$ one third lighter than a corresponding film-based solution). Finally, the inverter prototype is also exploited to validate experimentally the proposed DC-link peak-to-peak voltage ripple estimation procedure, based on the newly obtained large-signal capacitance characterization.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2023.3307101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10226263","Three-phase inverter;DC-link capacitor;ceramic capacitors;film capacitors;electric vehicles (EVs)","Inverters;Capacitance;Ceramic capacitors;Ceramics;Voltage;Power system measurements;Dielectrics","","33","","39","IEEE","22 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since modern buildings are usually equipped with large parking lots for EVs, it shows vital practical significance to utilize the on-site wind power generation to charge EVs parked in the buildings. In this paper, we first use a case study in Beijing to show that the on-site wind power generation of high-rise buildings can potentially support all the EVs in the city. Considering that the charging demand of EVs usually does not align with the uncertain wind power, the coordination of EV charging with the locally generated wind power in a microgrid of buildings is investigated and three main contributions are made. First, we investigate the problem and formulate it as a Markov decision process, which incorporates the random driving requirements of EVs among the buildings. Second, we develop a distributed simulation-based policy improvement (DSBPI) method, which can improve from heuristic and experience-based policies.

Electric mobility emerges as a viable and effective solution, offering cost-efficient means of transportation. However, the rise in fuel expenses, climate change, and unregulated charging of electric vehicles (EVs) have necessitated a transformative shift in the operation of smart grids. The exponential rise in EV charging requirements has the potential to adversely affect power grids, resulting in peak demand, grid overload, energy hub emissions, and possible infrastructure overburden. This study presents a predictive cost model that utilizes a hybrid search and rescue (SAR) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), denoted as the SAR-ANFIS approach. The model is designed to effectively model complex dynamic energy emission dispatch scenarios that are integrated with transient charging loads. These scenarios include peak, off-peak, electric power research institute (EPRI), and stochastic scenarios. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the cost of charging scenarios while providing policymakers with a tool to create financial budgets for forthcoming electric vehicle loads. This is achieved through the use of a fuzzy model that has the ability to predict costs. The ANFIS exhibits robust predictive capabilities owing to its aptitude for acquiring and representing intricate non-linear associations between input and output variables. The incorporation of ANFIS into a SAR algorithm results in improved predictive capacity through the optimization of the learning process, enhancement of model accuracy, and facilitation of efficient parameter tuning. The integration of ANFIS and SAR algorithms enhances predictive accuracy and robustness by leveraging the former’s adaptive and learning capabilities and the latter’s global search and optimization capabilities. The model considers various charging strategies and dispatch constraints within an energy hub. The attainment of the 24-hour pricing scheme is achieved by solving a minimum-cost optimization problem, which serves as the initial training data for the development of the proposed model using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy approach. The proposed approach effectively coordinates the various charging behaviours of electric vehicles, including those identified by the EPRI, as well as stochastic, peak, and off-peak charging, at the system level. The proposed methodology offers several advantages, including the facilitation of coordination among various charging scenarios for EVs and the creation of a cost prediction model that can assist policymakers in devising budgetary plans for future EV loads. One of the benefits of this technology is its capacity for autonomy, which enables vehicle owners to charge their electric vehicles in a cost-effective manner, regardless of the specific scenario they find themselves in. Furthermore, the suggested plan has the potential to mitigate the release of greenhouse gases from the power generation sector, thereby facilitating the establishment of a viable charging network that is environmentally sustainable. The present study examines the efficacy of the SAR-ANFIS approach and model on a standardized test system across a range of load profiles.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3303963","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning under the auspices of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea(grant numbers:20213030020160); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214281","Neuro-fuzzy;charging scenarios;cost prediction model;electric vehicles;optimization;economic emission dispatch","Neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Costs;Predictive models;Electric vehicles;Economics;Load modeling;Adaptation models;Stochastic processes;Electric potential;Vehicle dynamics;Climate change","","40","","66","CCBYNCND","10 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This increasing EV penetration is anticipated to result in a growing electricity demand to address the EV charging requirements. Therefore, precise demand modeling is essential to enable optimal sizing of the electricity generation and distribution networks as well as optimal placement of the EV charging infrastructure. Furthermore, microscopic modeling of EV traffic patterns and trip-wise energy requirements is essential to enable effective charging coordination and demand distribution for on-the-move EVs. However, microscopic EV demand modeling is typically hindered by the scarcity of open-access data that integrates EV charging and driving patterns.

Reactive power compensation from photovoltaic (PV) inverters and active power curtailment of PV output are commonly used to mitigate voltage-related problems. However, the charging/discharging flexibility of EVs can be used to avoid PV output curtailment and save energy motivating methods to coordinate EV charging with PVs. Unfortunately, a large number of control variables makes the centralized voltage control computationally expensive. In this work, a decentralized voltage control algorithm which considers the active and reactive power compensation from PV inverters and EVs is presented. The proposed approach helps to solve the voltage issues in a more effective way. The approach involves clustering of the distribution network based on modified modularity, an index that considers EV flexibility and prediction time period. A model predictive control (MPC)-based algorithm is proposed for each cluster to solve the voltage problem using the respective PVs and EVs, while ensuring that the EV charging demand is satisfied while contributing to the voltage regulation.

For Porto Santo Island, the main goal is the sizing of a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) to avoid frequency stability problems. For Madeira Island, the objective relies on the exploitation of hydro resources through the quantification of the technical benefits resulting from variable speed hydro pumping stations that are able to provide primary frequency regulation services in the pump operation mode.

Equipped with energy storage devices, EV aggregation can provide reliable SFR. However, the main challenge is to guarantee reliable intra-interval SFR capacities and inter-interval delivery following the automatic generation control (AGC) signal. Furthermore, aggregated EV SFR provision will be further complicated by the EV charging time anxiety because SFR provision might extend EV’s charging time. This paper proposes a deliverable EV SFR provision with a charging-time-constrained control strategy. First, a charging-time-constrained EV aggregation is proposed to address the uncertainty of EV capacity based on the state-space model considering the charging-time restriction of EV owners. Second, a real-time economic dispatch and time domain simulation (RTED-TDS) cosimulation framework is proposed to verify financial results and the dynamic performance of the EV SFR provision. Last, the proposed charging time-constrained EV aggregation is validated on the IEEE 39-bus system. The results demonstrate that with charging time-constrained EV aggregation, the dynamic performance of the system can be improved with a marginal increase in total cost.

Traditional planning approaches often struggle with the probabilistic nature of DER adoption and the computational burden of Monte Carlo-based simulations. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic framework for hosting capacity assessment, eliminating the need for Monte Carlo simulations while improving accuracy and efficiency. We formulate hosting capacity as an optimization problem that accounts for DER adoption uncertainty and grid reliability constraints. Our method determines PV and EV hosting capacities under different confidence levels and identifies optimal non-wires alternatives (NWAs), such as BESS, to enhance grid capacity. Our findings reveal that the proposed method provides more reliable hosting capacity estimates with significantly reduced computational time compared to traditional approaches.

With an increase in grid-connected vehicles, the power grid needs to increase its generation capacity to meet their charging demand. Thus, from a grid perspective, it is essential to find the maximum number of EVs that the existing infrastructure can handle. This research proposes a new framework to identify the fleet size capability of a power network in both uncontrolled and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) modes of operation. The proposed model is modeled as an optimization problem and tested on a system that is formed by combining IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system and a ten-unit generation system. Simulation results show that the current system can handle a fixed number of EVs when they operate independently. Participation of EVs in a V2G market significantly enhances the fleet size handling capability of the existing infrastructure, which is approximately four times the present capacity. Furthermore, a relation between the fleet size of EVs and operating points of plants is extracted, which is very beneficial for system planners. The result reveals that the time span requirements for power infrastructure upgradation can be increased by twofold if the V2G market is applied in the network.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2018.2861409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8423496","Economic dispatch (ED);electric vehicles (EVs);vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Vehicle-to-grid;Employment;Standards;Informatics;Economics","","31","","27","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite the improvement of forecasting tools, and the development of strategies to deal with this uncertainty (for instance, considering Monte Carlo simulation to generate a set of different possible scenarios), the risk associated with such variable resources cannot be neglected and deserves proper attention to guarantee the correct functioning of the entire system. This paper proposes a risk-based optimization approach for the centralized day-ahead ERM taking into account extreme events. Risk-neutral and risk-averse methodologies are implemented, where the risk-averse strategy considers the worst scenario costs through the conditional value-at-risk ( $CVaR$ ) method. The model is formulated from the perspective of an aggregator that manages multiple technologies such as distributed generation, demand response, energy storage systems, among others. The case study analysis the aggregator’s management inserted in a 13-bus distribution network in the smart grid context with high penetration of renewable energy and electric vehicles. Results show an increase of nearly 4% in the day-ahead operational costs comparing the risk-neutral to the risk-averse strategy, but a reduction of up to 14% in the worst-case scenario cost.

The parallel operation of the PABTS forms a dc-microgrid, owing to the low inertia of the dc-link capacitance, the charging and discharging tests of the batteries can easily cause dc-bus voltage fluctuations, which may jeopardize the system stability. To increase the system inertia and achieve good system stability, a fractional-order model-predictive-control (FOMPC) and fractional-order virtual-inertia-control (FOVIC) strategy (namely, FOMPC-FOVIC method) is proposed for the bidirectional grid-connected converter. First, the fractional-order virtual inertial link is used to replace the integral-order virtual inertial link, which significantly improves the system stability. Second, combined with fractional-order model-predictive-control, virtual dc current compensation is proposed to further suppress the dc-bus voltage fluctuations. Finally, the fractional-order discrete state-space equation of the virtual inertial link is derived, and the cost function design and its optimal solution are elaborated. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FOMPC-FOVIC scheme, experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in terms of inertial support and dc-bus voltage regulation.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2022.3171556","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2019J033); Key R&D Plan of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan province(grant numbers:20ZDYF2816); State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System Generation Equipment(grant numbers:SKLD20M11); Tsinghua University; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515010666); Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo(grant numbers:FB0008,1210208); Velux Fonden; VILLUM Investigator; Center for Research on Microgrids(grant numbers:25920); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9767555","Battery test system;dc-MG;fractional-order system;model predictive control;virtual inertia control","Batteries;Stability analysis;Voltage control;Damping;Power system stability;Fluctuations;Electric vehicles","","20","","43","IEEE","3 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the process of optimal allocation, based on the market rules of third-party subject participation in auxiliary services, the bidding strategy of EV-storage coordinated EV participation in auxiliary services market considering daily load scale changes is designed, while the conditional value at risk (CVaR) method is used to determine the short-term coordinated energy storage capacity and efficiency storage capacity considering the uncertainty of EV response situation; then, based on the annual EV load scale change, the benefit calculation function is constructed by considering various factors such as auxiliary service market revenue, spread revenue, investment cost and market opportunity cost of EV-storage participation in the auxiliary market.

Most of the current EV scheduling solutions are either centralized, which suffer from low reliability and high complexity, while existing decentralized solutions do not facilitate the efficient scheduling of on-move EVs in large-scale networks considering a smart energy distribution system. Motivated by smart cities applications, we consider in this paper the optimal scheduling of EVs in a geographically large-scale smart energy distribution system where EVs have the flexibility of charging/discharging at spatially-deployed smart charging stations (CSs) operated by individual aggregators. In such a scenario, we define the social welfare maximization problem as the total profit of both supply and demand sides in the form of a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. Due to the intractability, we then propose an online decentralized algorithm with low complexity which utilizes effective heuristics to forward each EV to the most profitable CS in a smart manner. Results of simulations on the IEEE 37 bus distribution network verify that the proposed algorithm improves the social welfare by about 30% on average with respect to an alternative scheduling strategy under the equal participation of EVs in charging and discharging operations. Considering the best-case performance where only EV profit maximization is concerned, our solution also achieves upto 20% improvement in flatting the final electricity load. Furthermore, the results reveal the existence of an optimal number of CSs and an optimal vehicle-to-grid penetration threshold for which the overall profit can be maximized. Our findings serve as guidelines for V2G system designers in smart city scenarios to plan a cost-effective strategy for large-scale EVs distributed energy management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987970","Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, South Korea, under the part of the project titled “Development of Automatic Identification Monitoring System for Fishing Gears.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066844","Electric vehicle-to-grid (V2G);distributed energy management;mixed integer non-linear programming;greedy-based algorithm;smart cities","Vehicle-to-grid;Smart cities;Distributed power generation;Integer programming;Battery powered vehicles;Energy management systems;Greedy algorithms","","48","","34","CCBY","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The novelty of this paper is the focus on the relationship between the size of stationary energy store and the user waiting time.

In this study, we propose an electric vehicle driving simulator using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and an EV demand response evaluation model. The former is a highly versatile EV driving simulator that can produce a random driving pattern based on actual EV fleet data, taking into account various features. The latter is a residential DR evaluation model that minimizes a household electricity bill based on the simulated fleet data and enables realistic DR operation using three processes: forecasting, planning, and operation. The contribution of this paper is to enable evaluation of realistic EV battery value in various housing and EV utilization combinations. We found that the EV battery control provides an economic benefit of US$62 (5% of the night-charging case cost) with only charge control and US$370 (31%) with charge and discharge control, as the average expected value based on our assumption of evaluation.

Accurately identifying PEVs serves as a crucial prerequisite for the establishment of charging station infrastructure. Existing methods for PEV identification can be divided into two categories, i.e., knowledge-driven (KD) models and data-driven (DD) models. The former suffers from the impact of explicit features extracted by subjective experience on identification performance, while the implicit features obtained by the latter are sensitive to the quality of recorded data. An interpretable knowledge and data dual-driven (IKD-DD) model is, therefore, proposed to integrate the robustness and learning abilities of two kinds of models by a mutual information-guided joint training process. A multiattention (MA) mechanism is, moreover, adopted to fuse the explicit and implicit features to enhance the discrimination ability of the feature set instead of conventional feature concatenation. Besides, a prototype-based contrastive loss function was introduced to learn PEV charging behavior even with limited labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PEV load identification method achieves an identification accuracy exceeding 90% across various simulated and real datasets. Compared to existing methods, the proposed model shows significant improvement and robust performance, even when applied to datasets with limited labels and poor quality.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2025.3574906","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52307128); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11021585","Joint training;limited labeled samples;load identification;multiattention (MA) mechanism;plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)","Load modeling;Feature extraction;Time series analysis;Data models;Training;Home appliances;Electricity;Data mining;Analytical models;Standards","","1","","34","IEEE","2 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a methodology that jointly optimizes the capacities and locations of dispatchable and non-dispatchable distributed generating units and battery energy storage system employed in a stand-alone MG serving conventional residential and electric vehicle charging load. The complex dual optimization problem is solved innovatively in two sequential steps. In the first step, the capacities of solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, battery energy storage system, and diesel generator are determined without actually considering the system design itself. While in the second step, a novel and simple methodology is developed which determines the sub-optimal capacities of distributed generation units along with their actual locations in the distribution system. To determine the optimal locations of distributed generation units, we defined a novel factor, losses-voltage-factor (LVF), which ensures reduced losses and better voltage quality. The proposed methodology gives a robust design that not only results in reduced losses and better voltage quality but also have higher reliability.

Integrating AVs and non-AVs in the existing traffic infrastructure has significantly increased the complexity of traffic patterns. This research work primes the enhanced Traffic Management System (e-TMS), a solution implemented to expedite emergency vehicle (EV) travel in the context of connected AVs (CAVs) and ensured secured communication employing public key infrastructure (PKI) among the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) framework. When an EV is detected, the IoV system verifies the EV’s signal using PKI, ensuring its authenticity and integrity by encrypting the communication between the EV and road side units (RSUs). Further, the e-TMS activates the platooning process where CAVs in the EV’s lane shift to the adjacent lanes and dynamically form platoons to create a dedicated lane for the EV. To further optimize the platooning process, an adaptive smart leader selection (ASLS) algorithm is employed to select a leader vehicle spontaneously among the AVs based on the proximity to the EV, communication reliability, and lane position. Radio Detection and Ranging devices aid this platooning process by providing distance and target velocity, which are needed to maintain the required distance between the AVs and ensure safe platoon formation. The e-TMS enhances EV response times and overall traffic flow efficiency and resulted in 27.8% increase in mean speed compared to the traditional methods.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3545424","NGNLab, Department of Computer Technology, Anna University, MIT Campus, Chennai, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10902363","Autonomous vehicles (AV);emergency vehicle (EV) navigation;Internet of Vehicles (IoV);public key infrastructure (PKI);smart platooning","Real-time systems;Safety;Heuristic algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Accuracy;Reliability;Trajectory;Roads;Public key;Nonce","","","","26","IEEE","25 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blockchain has a potential impact on newly emergent actors, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and the charging facility units (CFUs) of the electricity grid. Although Blockchain offers magnificent decentralized solutions, the central management of DSOs still plays a significant, non-negligible role, owing to the reality of the existing grid structure. Numerous related studies of proposed blockchain-based EV systems have investigated the energy costs of EVs, fast and efficient charging, privacy and security, P2P energy trading, sharing economy, the selection of appropriate CFUs location, and scheduling. However, cooperation with DSO organizations has not been adequately addressed. Blockchain-based solutions mainly suggest an entirely distributed and decentralized approach for energy trading; however, converting the entire power system infrastructure is considerably expensive. Building a thoroughly decentralized electricity network in a short time is nearly impossible, particularly at the national grid level. In this regard, the applicability of the solutions is as significant as their appropriateness, especially from the DSO perspective, and must be examined closely. We searched and analyzed the blockchain literature related to EVs, CFUs, DERs, microgrids, marketing, and DSOs to define the DSO-based requirements for potential blockchain applications in the energy sector, specifically EV evolution.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122987","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea(grant numbers:20191210301820); “Human Resources Program in Energy Technology” of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea(grant numbers:20194030202370); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9585578","AMI;blockchain in energy;DERs;DSO blockchain;EVs;market;microgrid;SCADA","Blockchains;Microgrids;Smart grids;Security;Privacy;Power system stability;Costs","","23","","138","CCBY","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The pricing schemes of fast charging stations significantly affects the EVs’ on-tirp charging behaviors and the operations of coupled power and transportation networks. This interdisciplinary paper proposes an optimal dynamic pricing method for fast charging stations to boost charging network operator’ (CNO’s) profits and avoid excessive charging costs of EVs. Time-varying traffic flow and charging demands are generated by a dynamic traffic assignment simulation, where a boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium model is presented to capture the cost sensitivity of EVs and gasoline vehicle users. Additionally, a market regulator supervises the CNO’s pricing, balancing the interests of the CNO and users via a regulation constraint. To address the optimal dynamic pricing issue, we propose a three-level Stackelberg game involving the distribution network operator, CNO, and users. The existence of a game equilibrium is assured by the fixed-point theory. A Gauss-Seidel iteration algorithm with inertia weight is designed to solve the pricing problem. The numerical results have corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed method, illuminating the effects of bounded rationality and market regulation on the CNO’s profits and users’ travel costs.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2024.3363040","“Pioneer” and “Leading Goose” Research and Development Program of Zhejiang(grant numbers:2023C03155); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52177119,52131202); National Natural Science Foundation of China International Collaboration Program Project(grant numbers:72111540273); Smart Urban Future (SURF) Laboratory, Zhejiang Province, the ZJU-UIUC Joint Research Center Project of Zhejiang University(grant numbers:DREMES202001); Special Support Plan for Zhejiang Province High-Level Talents(grant numbers:2022R52012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10423379","Bounded rationality;dynamic user equilibrium;fast charging station;market regulation;optimal dynamic pricing","Pricing;Costs;Vehicle dynamics;Regulation;Transportation;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms","","20","","40","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed machine efficiency map and MCM mass evaluation methods are the means to achieve this goal without machine pre-design. The efficiency evaluation method enables to evaluate machines efficiency maps only with four basic design specifications (rated speed, rated torque, overload factor, and speed expansion ratio). Neither finite element (FE) nor experimental data (inductance and resistance) are used. Its calculation is fast and can be finished within several milliseconds. The method is validated by comparisons with the experimental efficiency maps of two prototypes. The proposed methods are proven having an accuracy that is acceptable for the MCM definition and pre-design. The exemption of machine pre-design saves a lot of time during sizing stage. The sizing optimization is realized by genetic algorithm. And the comparisons of different sizing are conducted with the same vehicle model. Moreover, general sizing rules for the similar EVs are proposed. For the studied EV, the number of machines is proposed as a function of traction power. The sized specifications could be used for more accurate machine design by the FE method in future.

The system partially alleviates feeder overloading by providing fast charging for the EV battery from the PV system. In addition, the charger is capable of diverting fast changes in PV power output to the battery, thereby reducing the rate of change of inverter output power to a level below the ramp rate of existing grid resources.

The problem is challenging since existing protection measures, such as $N-1$ security designed to make the power system resilient to single component failures, also provide resilience to load changes to a large extent. Thus, strategically injected load perturbations that lead to network failure can be regarded as rare events. To this end, we adopt a rare-event sampling approach to uncover LAAs distributed temporally and spatially across the power network. The key advantage of this sampling method is the ability to sample efficiently from multi-modal conditional distributions with disconnected support. Furthermore, we systematically compare the impacts of static (one-time manipulation of demand) and dynamic (attack over multiple time periods) LAAs. We perform extensive simulations using benchmark IEEE test bus systems.

Therefore, a comprehensive coordinated PEV charging scheme is urgently needed to facilitate the smooth grid integration of PEVs at all levels (e.g., transmission systems, distribution systems, and charging stations). This paper presents detailed mathematical modeling of a novel hierarchical framework for coordinated PEV charging at multiple timescales (i.e., day-ahead and real-time).

"Fairness and Utilitarianism in Allocating Energy to EVs During Power Contingencies Using Modified Division Rules","A. Hussain; P.

The idea of essential energy demand is introduced in this paper to maximize the number of EVs that are served during power contingencies. For EVs carrying out the time-critical task(s), the essential energy demand is defined as the amount of energy required by EVs to accomplish their upcoming task(s). For EVs carrying out delay-tolerant tasks, it is defined as the amount of energy required by EVs to travel to a nearby healthy charging station. To this end, an EV ranking mechanism is devised considering the full and essential energy demands along with the urgency of EVs. Subsequently, EVs with higher ranks are prioritized during energy allocation. The performance of the proposed method is compared with four existing division rules, i.e., proportional, constrained equal awards, constrained equal losses, and sequential priority rules. A utilitarianism index is proposed to analyze the performance of these methods and fairness is evaluated using existing indices, such as Jain's fairness index and cost of fairness index. The proposed method has outperformed existing division rules in both utilitarianism and fairness for the essential energy demand. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of uncertain parameters such as EV fleet size, available/required energy, and weight factors is carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed method under various conditions.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2022.3161897","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:ALLRP 549804-19); Alberta Electric System Operator; AltaLink; ATCO Electric; ENMAX; EPCOR Distribution and Transmission Inc.; FortisAlberta; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9740518","Division rules;electric vehicles;energy allocation;fairness;power outage;resilience;utilitarianism","Resource management;Indexes;Power system reliability;Transportation;Task analysis;Costs;Charging stations","","23","","49","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model, taking into account the uncertainties regarding energy and frequency regulation prices. The risks associated with the uncertainties are managed using the conditional value-at-risk method.

By addressing only some of the loss mechanisms, previously proposed efficiency improvement approaches offer limited improvements in size, cost, and efficiency tradeoffs. This paper shows how all dominant loss mechanisms in automotive powertrain applications can be mitigated using a new boost composite converter approach. In the composite dc-dc architecture, the loss mechanisms associated with indirect power conversion are addressed explicitly, resulting in fundamental efficiency improvements over wide ranges of operating conditions. Several composite converter topologies are presented and compared to state-of-the-art boost converter technologies. It is found that the selected boost composite converter results in a decrease in the total loss by a factor of 2-4 for typical drive cycles. Furthermore, the total system capacitor power rating and energy rating are substantially reduced, which implies potentials for significant reductions in system size and cost.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2016.2533347","Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-EE0006921); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7415939","Boost converter;composite converter;dc–dc converter;electric vehicle powertrain","DC-DC power converters;Mechanical power transmission;Vehicles;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Batteries;Power generation;Capacitors","","134","","52","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, one of the key challenges in designing the novel EV system is to forecast the accurate time for the replacement of conventional vehicles and optimization of charging vehicles. Designing the charging infrastructure for EVs has many impacts such as stress on the power network, increase in traffic flow, and change in driving behaviors. Therefore, the optimal placement of charging stations is one of the most important issues to address to increase the use of electric vehicles. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to present an optimization method for choosing optimal locations for electric car charging stations for Campus charging over long-term planning. The charger placement problem is formulated as a complex Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) which combines spatial analysis techniques, power network load flow, traffic flow models, and constrained procedures. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is used to determine the optimal weights of the criteria, while the mean is used to determine the distinct weights for each criterion using the AHP in terms of accessibility, environmental effect, power network indices, and traffic flow impacts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to a real case study of Qatar University with collected certain attributes data and relevant decision makers as the inputs to the linguistic assessments and MCDM model. The Ranking of the optimal locations is done by aggregating four techniques: Simple Additive Weighting Method (SAW, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE-II). A long-term impact analysis is a secondary output of this study that allows decision-makers to evaluate their policy impacts. The findings demonstrate that the proposed framework can locate optimal charging station sites. These findings could also help administrators and policymakers make effective choices for future planning and strategy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3224796","National Priority Research Program (NPRP)(grant numbers:NPRP14S-0305-210019); Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9963948","Analytic hierarchy process;charger;electric vehicle;load flow multi-criteria decision making","Analytical models;Surface acoustic waves;Transportation;Analytic hierarchy process;Charging stations;Linguistics;Electric vehicles","","14","","46","CCBY","24 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the high computational burden is the main obstacle of this method. Therefore, this paper proposes a surrogate-assisted multi-objective probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) to reduce the expensive computational time. The surrogate model is developed by using a machine learning method namely deep learning which is used for bypassing the deterministic load flow calculation. Zhao's point estimation method combined with Nataf transformation is selected to handle the PPF analysis considering correlated uncertain input variables. The multi-objective POPF problem is solved using the multi-objective differential evolution. The historical data including solar irradiation, ambient temperature, residential load, and electric vehicle (EV) travel distance is calculated in the low voltage distribution system to demonstrate the potential advantages of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed surrogate assisted multi-objective POPF method provides the optimal solution for operating cost, helps to prolong transformer life and reducing environmental impact.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical multi-objective optimization approach for locating publicly-owned charging stations (POCS) within a collusive EV charging-as-a-service market. The approach trades off the users’ welfare against the market in a tri-level leader-follower structure: The lower level allocates users’ choice via a variational inequality model, depending on the service prices and placement of facilities determined in the middle and upper level. To solve this problem, we design a double-loop iterative method, which evolutionarily optimizes the location in the outer loop and exactly calculates the collusive market model in the remaining part. Numerical studies validate the performance of our method in terms of quality of solution sets. The findings show that investing POCS could effectively handle the collusive behavior and so as to promote the sustainability of CaaS economy.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2025.3592976","Smart Grid-National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2024ZD0800300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72371123); Shenzhen Sustainable Development Research Program(grant numbers:KCXST20221021111210023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11098530","CaaS;equilibrium program with equilibrium constraints;Nash bargaining;multilevel optimization;nonlinear programming","Optimization;Charging stations;Games;Planning;Transportation;Pricing;Training;Sustainable development;Power systems;Numerical models","","1","","29","IEEE","28 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper identifies three important gaps in current literature. First, the upper-bounding issue of the tariff-based incentives (road toll, charging service fee, etc) is not well addressed, which might raise drivers’ dissatisfaction or compromise system performance. Second, the TN-PDN cooperation is generally built upon a simple assumption without any guarantee on its existence or stability. Third, the autonomy of network operators in tariff setting, operating goals, and data privacy is overlooked in prevailing bi-level social-cost-minimization frameworks. To bridge the above research gaps, this article proposes a novel tri-level framework where a social entity (SE) at the upper level sets the tariff bound towards the lowest social cost and dispenses subsidies towards a stable TN-PDN cooperation, network operators at the middle level jointly manage TNs and PDNs towards the optimal status, and travelers at the lower level decide charging&route choices to minimize individual travel cost. Cooperative Game Theory is adopted to characterize the cooperation and cost allocation between the middle-level operators, while the Core size is introduced to quantify the coalition stability and to guide the SE’s subsidization. A slope-identification based algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the tri-level problem in a privacy-preserving manner, and a geometric analysis is conducted to deduce the Core size and the required subsidies. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2023.3270964","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1966205); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:B220203016); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX_220603); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10109826","Electric vehicle;user equilibrium;coalition game;tri-level optimization;power-transportation cooperation","Costs;Tariffs;Vehicles;Games;Stability analysis;Roads;Resource management","","11","","48","IEEE","27 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then optimize these formulas using both the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO). Results clearly show that, with our HEMS system, RES and ESS can help to drop home energy cost significantly to 19.7%, compared with the results of previous works. By increasing charge/discharge rate of ESS, energy cost can be decreased by 4.3% for 0.6 kW and 8.5% for 0.9 kW.

The study first improves the recursive least squares algorithm by combining the forgetting factor, and constructs a vehicle energy consumption identification model based on the improved recursive least squares algorithm and neural network. Then, a path optimization model based on improved seagull optimization is established using chaotic mapping strategy and t-distribution to improve the seagull optimization algorithm. The results showed that the predicted final energy consumption of the model constructed in the study was 2.81kW.h, with an error rate of 5.1%.

In this paper, leveraging blockchain technology, we first propose a privacy-preserving charging-station-to-vehicle (CS2V) energy trading scheme. The CS2V scheme is useful in crowded cities where there is a need for a charging infrastructure that can charge many EVs daily. We also propose a privacy-preserving vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy trading scheme. The V2V scheme is useful when charging stations are not available or far and cheaper prices can be offered from EVs, e.g., if they charge from renewable energy sources. In the V2V scheme, the privacy of both charging and discharging EVs including location, time, and amount of power are preserved. To preserve privacy in both schemes, EVs are anonymous, however, a malicious EV may abuse the anonymity to launch Sybil attacks by pretending as multiple non-exiting EVs to launch powerful attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting multiple reservations/offers without committing to them, to prevent other EVs from charging and make the trading system unreliable. To thwart the Sybil attacks, we use a common prefix linkable anonymous authentication scheme, so that if an EV submits multiple reservations/offers at the same timeslot, the blockchain can identify such submissions. To further protect the privacy of EV drivers, we introduce an anonymous and efficient blockchain-based payment system that cannot link individual drivers to specific charging locations.

The VOS approach enables EVs in a fleet to compute signals reflecting their need for charge and willingness to supply power. An aggregator collects these signals and implements the control with minor computational effort. We evaluate the VOS approach on a scenario for Munich, Germany, based on a mobility survey and real electricity demand and solar generation data. First, we compare our approach against a centralized optimization in terms of objective fulfillment and solving time. We show that it achieves a competitive performance, especially for large vehicle fleets. Second, we present a statistical method to evaluate the performance and limitations of our approach.

Alternatively, in frontside illumination (FSI), the integration of circuitry within the pixel area results in a significant reduction of the FF. Thus, this brief proposes an external counter architecture with a photon event summing and coincidence detection scheme.

While these sources have accompanied in a gathering of advantages, such as cost-effective operation of wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) installations and the mitigation of environmental hazards linked with traditional power sources, they have also introduced a host of challenges to planning and operation of power systems. Also, Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) stand out as a highly promising technology for reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector, aligning with the global Net-zero target. The standard optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which is naturally nonlinear, has become even more complex with the addition of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles along with traditional thermal power generators. This increased complexity comes from the unpredictable and intermittent nature of these new resources. Monte Carlo techniques are used to estimate the production costs of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and analyze their viability. The uncertainty of the renewable sources and PEVs is modeled using Weibull, lognormal, and normal probability distribution functions (PDFs). The comprehensive OPF, incorporating renewable energy components and PEVs, is cast as a single objective problem encompassing various objectives, such as decreasing fuel costs, total emissions, voltage deviations, and real transmission losses. This research shares a common objective by introducing a novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm (MRGTO) to address the OPF challenge. Additionally, the study explores the impact of renewable energy resources and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) on the stochastic OPF problem. The MRGTO employs artificial gorilla troops optimizer (GTO) with manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm to achieve the optimal results for the OPF problem with stochastic RES and V2G. The developed technique is expected to increase the solution accuracy through increasing the solution diversity through an optimization procedure. Initial assessments are executed on benchmark functions. After that, a combined model of wind and PV-integrated IEEE 30-bus system are executed by the proposed MRGTO algorithm and other well-known optimization algorithms. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using the IEEE 30-bus test system under different scenarios. The evaluations have shown the proposed MRGTO technique to be superior at attainment a best solution for the OPF problem considering stochastic wind and PV power and V2G. Moreover, the obtained solutions confirmed the MRGTO technique would be more effective in optimization with quicker convergence rate, and higher convergence precision. After testing, the effectiveness of the MRGTO algorithm has been found to be much robust than the conventional artificial gorilla troops optimizer, manta ray foraging optimization, and other well-known published heuristics, metaheuristics, and hybrid optimization techniques.INDEX TERMS Optimal power flow, plug-in electric vehicle, renewable energy sources, V2G, artificial gorilla troops optimizer, manta ray foraging optimization.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3425754","Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University (PSAU); SDG Roadmap Research Funding Program project(grant numbers:PSAU-2023-SDG-16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589639","Optimal power flow;plug-in electric vehicle;renewable energy sources;V2G;artificial gorilla troops optimizer;manta ray foraging optimization","Optimization;Renewable energy sources;Uncertainty;Costs;Vehicle-to-grid;Power system dynamics;Metaheuristics","","12","","52","CCBYNCND","9 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the proposed voltage control algorithm, an industrial implementation framework is established to enable the interactive communications among the on-load tap changers, the inverter-based distributed energy resources, etc. Compared to previous studies on voltage regulation in microgrids, this work is distinguished by the fact that the proposed voltage control algorithm is implemented and tested on a real-world experimental test site, known as the micro smart grid on the EUREF-Campus in Berlin.

This work presents a market mechanism for smart charging that optimally allocates available charging capacity in a way that ensures network stability, while at the same time allowing vehicles to express individual preferences regarding their charging rates. Those who want higher rates can receive these, but must pay a higher price. The mechanism takes into account network-specific constraints such as total network load, voltage drop, and phase unbalance. However, since vehicles have differing impacts on these constraints, this leads to unequal access to the available resources (i.e., charging capacity), resulting in an unfair market. An additional constraint can be introduced to level the playing field for all users, but it leads to a reduction in aggregate performance. The mechanism is shown to be efficient and strategy-proof, so users cannot gain an unfair advantage by misrepresenting their preferences. A series of simulations demonstrate the mechanism's behavior and properties.

The linearization methods for the nonlinear terms of the branch power flow equations are proposed. Two stages linear programming (LP) is introduced for EVCC to minimize the total charging costs of the holders where three-phase imbalance, charging demand, voltage, and power flow constraints have been taken into account.

However, the joint modeling and optimal scheduling for multiple BSSs is complex and rarely researched, especially when the idle state of charging bays (CBs) is non-negligible. In this article, for the distribution network (DN) with multiple BSSs, a joint optimal charging scheduling strategy considering the idle state of CB is developed to ensure the system’s safe operation and BSSs’ economic charging. In particular, a three-layered coupled model for multiple BSSs is constructed by modeling on the CB, BSS, and DN layers, which is used to visualize each BSS’s state quantity changes and their charging behaviors’ impacts on DN. To further improve the accuracy of this model, the CB’s idle state is given special consideration by developing a three-stage modeling method, which can detailedly describe the finite state transfer of CBs. In addition, to deal with the joint scheduling of multiple BSSs (JS-MBSS) problem upon the constructed model, a bi-level solving algorithm is proposed to convert the complex JS-MBSS into a solvable mixed integer quadratic constraint program (MIQCP). Finally, the proposed strategy and two others are verified via the modified IEEE 33-bus system. The results suggest that by adopting the proposed strategy, the total charging cost and the cumulative voltage fluctuation are reduced by 39.42% and 30.84%, respectively, which verifies the proposal’s positive benefits in stabilizing grid operation and enhancing the charging economy.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2025.3543596","Smart Gird-National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2024ZD0800800); Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) Low-carbon and Reliable Urban Power Distribution System Demonstration Project(grant numbers:SGTJDK00DWJS2400298); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10892249","Battery swapping station (BSS);finite-state modeling;joint optimal charging scheduling;multilayer coupled modeling","Optimal scheduling;Batteries;Costs;Planning;Uncertainty;Investment;Transportation;Electrification;Electricity;Training","","2","","32","IEEE","19 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, random driving behavior and area-specific market rules complicate the market participation of EV aggregators in energy and reserve markets. The goal of this paper is to investigate the design and performance of a system that would enable EV aggregators to participate in wholesale electricity markets.

This study addresses these challenges by developing distributed energy management systems for the EVs and the ESSs, and sizing approaches for the PVs and the ESSs, by enabling multi-agent systems and fuzzy cognitive maps. The optimization framework simultaneously considers six key objective functions which studied separately or in limited combinations: (i) ESS installation cost, (ii) low-voltage network operation parameters, (iii) active power losses, (iv) EV charging times, (v) total energy costs, and (vi) excess energy from PV systems. Using environmental conditions and energy purchase costs to define two regions, Heraklion, Greece, and Berlin, Germany, under varying EV integration rates, the proposed methodology enables the IEEE European Low Voltage feeder as a case study and Euclidean distance is used to identify optimal solutions from the Pareto frontiers. Results show that the integration of the distributed ESS contributes to a significant reduction in network’s energy consumption, while reduced solar irradiance in Berlin leads to different cost and operational patterns.

The cost of vehicle discharge compensation is considered to improve the willingness of users to participate in scheduling and the user satisfaction. To avoid the “dimension disaster” caused by the centralized dispatching of large numbers of electric vehicles, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to divide the vehicles into different groups.

Accelerated aging of expensive grid assets, such as power transformers, is one of the primary issues that these utilities are facing.

The LEC is proposed to participate in providing manual frequency restoration reserves (mFRR) or tertiary reserves. In addition, the community is supposed to have a number of electric vehicles (EVs) and a battery energy storage system (BESS) as FERs. The scheduling of the community, which is fully compliant with the existing balancing market structure, comprises two stages. The first stage is performed in day-ahead, in which the energy community management center (ECMC) estimates the amount of available flexible capacities for mFRR provision. In this stage, control parameters are deployed by the ECMC in order to control the offered flexibility of the BESS. In the second stage, the real-time scheduling of the community is performed for each hour, taking into account the assigned and activated amount of reserve power. The target of the real-time stage is to maximize the community's profit. Finally, the model is implemented utilizing a case study considering different day-ahead control parameters of the BESS.

In this method, the cost function (CF) considers tracking control of grid current, filter capacitance voltage, and converter-side current as well as switching frequency before allocating different weights in its calculations. Thus, multiobjective optimization is achieved by trying to find the optimal switching sequence that minimizes the CF. However, as the horizon length is increased, the solution search enlarges exponentially, soon requiring an exhaustive search through each of many candidates. To alleviate this computational burden, this article presents an FCS-MPC method that is based on a new node-comparison sphere decoding method (NC-SDM), thereby reformulating the CF minimization problem into an integral-least-squares problem. The proposed NC-SDM reduces the computational burden associated with longer horizons by excluding as many suboptimal solutions from the candidates as possible. It does this by continuously comparing the length of two paths corresponding to each node of the search tree, and always taking the branch with shorter length. The final length of the total path is set as the initial radius after superposing all the path lengths. As a result, the initial radius estimation is much smaller than that in the Babai method and the computational cost is further reduced. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the feasibility and suitability of the proposed method.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2020.3006432","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2019J033); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51975453); Key R&D Plan of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:20ZDYF2816); State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipment; Tsinghua University(grant numbers:SKLD20M11); Velux Fonden; VILLUM Investigator Grant Center for Research on Microgrids(grant numbers:25920); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9132685","Cost function (CF);finite-control-set (FCS) model predictive control;node comparison method;three-phase four-leg grid-connected converter (GCC)","Switches;Decoding;Predictive models;Voltage control;Bridge circuits;Legged locomotion","","26","","37","IEEE","2 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To relieve the power losses as well as maintain high-quality current output, a low-loss-tolerant sequential model predictive control (LL-TSMPC) is proposed. First, based on the energy loss analysis under switching transitions per commutation, the prediction models of both switching loss and conduction loss are established.

Finally, because multiobjective model predictive control (MPC) requires selecting appropriate weighting factors, complicating the design to solve this problem, TSMPC-based lexicographic optimization is introduced to eliminate the tradeoff factors and simplify the MPC controller design.

By using a simple center-tapped clamp circuit, which consists of two diodes and one capacitor, many limitations in conventional PSFB converters are solved. The proposed center-tapped clamp circuit provides the clamping path and allows the secondary voltage stress to be clamped to the secondary-reflected input voltage. This results in a greatly reduced conduction loss in the secondary full-bridge rectifier (FBR) due to the low-forward-voltage drop of low-voltage-rated diodes, and the resistor-capacitor-diode snubber loss is eliminated. In addition, the circulating current in the primary side is removed without any duty-cycle loss. Furthermore, the turn-off switching loss in the FBR is substantially reduced due to the decreased reverse-recovery current and the reduced reverse voltage. With these advantages, high efficiency can be achieved. Besides, the size of the output inductor is considerably reduced with the aid of clamping voltage, resulting in a high power density with saving the cost. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter, a 3.3-kW prototype was tested.

Firstly, an FDIAs detection layer based on an unknown input observer (UIO) utilizing an adaptive threshold has been proposed. An adaptive threshold aims to enhance detection sensitivity and reduce false alarms by distinguishing between actual attacks and temporal discrepancies in observer error caused by internal disturbances. Secondly, to ensure timely and accurate mitigation of FDIAs, an estimation layer utilizing a prescribed-time unknown input observer (PTUIO) has been designed. PTUIO is designed to be robust against unknown inputs and parameter uncertainty. The PTUIO employs periodic time-delayed output to estimate system states and FDIAs within a predefined time. Afterward, a two-layer robust and resilient LFC system was developed. The first layer ensures the rejection of unknown inputs, including load/generation disturbances and FDIAs based on PTUIO estimations. The second layer incorporates robust state feedback control, which stabilizes the microgrid and accurately tracks the frequency reference.

Therefore, this article provides practical guidelines for implementing a 50 kW three-phase power factor correction (PFC) converter, commonly used as an ac–dc converter module in dc fast charger. A quantitative analysis of the volume, performance, cost, and efficiency of different filter types for a three-phase PFC designed under identical conditions is conducted, providing selection criteria based on design priorities.

The effects of gain variations on steady-state and dynamic characteristics, along with current total harmonic distortion (THD), are analyzed.

In this research, a coupled power-TN operation model is proposed to achieve the goals of cost reduction and low-carbon emissions, as well as minimize each entity’s self-consumption. Thus, a bi-level game framework is adopted to model competitive behaviors. Specifically, the upper-level TN operator (TNO) determines monetary incentives (i.e., charging prices and carbon taxes) to guide vehicles, and the PDN operator (PDNO) cooperates with the TNO to optimize power flows. The lower-level EV driver group (EVDG) and gasoline vehicle driver group (GVDG) make route choices with informed incentives to minimize consumption. A game-theoretic approach is adopted to prove the existence of route selection solutions in the noncooperative competitive behavior between EVDG and GVDG. Moreover, a carbon-tax-based pricing scheme is proposed to schedule vehicles in an economic and low-carbon manner. The bi-level model with four entities (i.e., PDNO, TNO, EVDG, and GVDG) is solved by a decentralized algorithm to identify the optimal operational state.

The study centered on the modeling and analysis of the integration of renewable energy sources and EVs into a microgrid. The microgrid comprises four essential elements: a diesel generator functioning as the primary power supply, a combination of a Photovoltaic (PV) farm and a wind farm for generating electricity, and a Vehicle-to Grid (V2G) system positioned near the microgrid’s load. The continuous increase in their energy production rate makes microgrids important. Microgrids can be designed to meet the energy needs of different establishments, including hospitals, universities, and EVs charging stations, as well as the energy demands of a district, town, or industrial site. Charging stations are essential for the purpose of replenishing the battery of an EVs. This paper investigates the influence of EVs on the microgrid network.

However, there are still many problems to be solved to increase the penetration level of renewable energy sources in a power system. Above all, a power system with a high renewable penetration level requires an entirely novel operational strategy and control approach to achieve reliable operation by considering the intermittency of variable renewable energy sources. This paper proposes power-sensitivities-based indirect voltage control of renewable energy generators with power constraints. The proposed method realizes seamless control of the voltage by compensating with the reactive power if the real power of the distributed generator (DG) is insufficient due to its intermittency. To achieve the proposed method, the real and reactive power references of DGs are initially operated based on the power sensitivities between generation and loads if all the DGs operate within the power constraints. However, if at least one of the DGs reaches its constraint limit, the references can be modified using other sensitivities between real and reactive power generation enabling indirect voltage control of DGs. Therefore, a high level of renewable penetration in power systems can be accomplished with the proposed method. The proposed method is verified with several case studies that are based on a microgrid with practical data from a real island power system. Verification is carried out using the power system computer aided design and electromagnetic transient including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC™) simulation software.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097350","National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea funded by the Korea Government(grant numbers:2019R1G1A1094387); Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant funded by the Korea Government (MOTIE) (Development of DC Power Trade Platform System in Public Community Which is Connected by EV-Renewable Based on Block Chain Technology)(grant numbers:20192010107050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9486837","Distributed generation;indirect voltage control;power sensitivity;renewable energy;variable renewable energy;voltage stability","Voltage control;Renewable energy sources;Power system stability;Generators;Sensitivity;Reactive power;Transient analysis;Climate change","","5","","25","CCBYNCND","15 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Next, we formulate the centralised day ahead distribution market which explicitly represents the physical system, supports unbalanced three phase networks with delta and wye connections, and incorporates the charging needs of electric vehicles under a uni- and a bi-directional charging scheme. The solution of the centralised market requires knowledge of electric vehicle information in terms of desired energy, departure and arrival times that electric vehicle owners are reluctant in providing. Moreover, the computational effort required to solve the day ahead distribution market in cases of numerous electric vehicles is very intensive. As such, we propose a distributed solution of the day ahead distribution market clearing mechanism over a time-varying communication network where no private information is exchanged. We also incorporate uncertainty of electric vehicle charging needs and provide guarantees on the probability of constraint satisfaction.

For each parking occurrence, load profile predictions properly take into account important factors, including actual state-of-charge of the battery, parking duration, parking type, and vehicle powertrain. Thus, the deterministic simulations capture the time history of vehicle driving and parking patterns using an equivalent 10 000 urban driving and parking days for the city of Winnipeg. These deterministic results are then compared to stochastic methods that differ in their treatment of how they model vehicle driving and charging habits. The new stochastic method introduced in this study more accurately captures the relationship of vehicle departure, arrival, and travel time compared to two previously used stochastic methods. It outperforms previous stochastic methods, having the lowest error at 3.4% when compared to the deterministic method for an electric sedan with a 24-kWhr battery pack. For regions where vehicle usage data is not available to predict plug-in electric vehicle load, the proposed stochastic method is recommended. In addition, using a combination of home, work, and commercial changing locales, and Level 1 versus Level 2 charging rates, deterministic simulations for urban run-out-of-charge events vary by less than 4% for seven charging scenarios selected. Using the vehicle usage data, charging scenarios simulated have no significant effect on urban run-out-of-charge events when the battery size for the electric sedan is increased. These results contribute towards utilities achieve a more optimal cost balance between: 1) charging infrastructure; 2) power transmission upgrades; 3) vehicle battery size; and 4) the addition of new renewable generation to address new electric vehicle loads for addressing energy drivers.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2162009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6017151","Plug-in electric vehicles;power generation peaking capacity;power generation planning;signal analysis","Vehicles;Stochastic processes;System-on-a-chip;Batteries;Nickel;Cities and towns;Predictive models","","258","5","25","IEEE","12 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to the proposed TE framework, the PEV owners get reimbursed by the BEMS for the flexibility they offer. In this regard, the PEV owners submit their response curves for reimbursement upon arrival. Then, the BEMS solves an optimization problem to maximize its own profit and determine the real-time TE market-clearing price.

For analyzing the vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle infrastructure, it is important to model the electrical as well as the communication network together. This will help in determining the influences of the communication network in the operation of the controller and grid. In this paper, a distribution system with five CSs and sampled data transmission between the entities are modeled and simulated in MATLAB Simulink for understanding the potential impact of the networked communication system on the grid operation. A fuzzy-logic controller (FLC) is used in the model. The performance of the FLC in terms of root mean square values is found to improve when the inputs (node voltage and total energy available in CSs) are synchronized at faster sampling rates.

Calculations show the existence of a quadratic relationship between the transformer life consumption and the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the battery charger current. Furthermore, the current THD should be limited to 25-30% in order to have a reasonable transformer life expectancy.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2003.813873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208386","","Batteries;Power quality;Transformers;Pulse width modulation;Power system harmonics;Circuits;Harmonic distortion;Temperature;Electric vehicles;Vehicle driving","","380","","18","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional simulators use a single method of discretization for all the components that results in imposing a large computational burden of inverting a large matrix as well as increased computations related to single method of discretization (that is typically a trapezoidal method). To overcome the problem of simulating large-area power grids with many XFCs, in this paper, advanced numerical simulation algorithms are applied for the first time together to reduce the dimension of matrix inversion. The algorithms include numerical stiffness-based segregation, time constant-based segregation, clustering and aggregation on differential algebraic equations (DAEs), and multi-order integration approaches. These algorithms apply multiple discretization algorithms rather than a single discretization algorithm that further reduces the computational burden. The approaches mentioned here have resulted in speed-up of up to 18x in the simulation of a single distribution system with 15 XFCs and of up to 271x in the simulation of a transmission-distribution system with 300 XFCs in multiple distribution feeders with respect to conventional simulators (like power systems computer aided design [PSCAD]).","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3212639","Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Oak Ridge National Laboratory; UT-Battelle; U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC05-00OR22725); UT-Battelle(grant numbers:DE-AC05-00OR22725); U.S. Department of Energy; United States Government purposes; DOE Public Access Plan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913669","Electromagnetic transient simulation;EMT;electric vehicle chargers;EV chargers;extreme fast charging;XFC;transmission-distribution grids","Computational modeling;Power system dynamics;Power grids;Mathematical models;Numerical models;Load modeling;Heuristic algorithms","","13","","18","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The complication is due to energy and time related constraints of PEVs that requires the complex non-linear time-coupled DOPF problem to be solved over a long period of few hours (e.g., 24-h). This paper presents a novel time-decoupled framework for solving the generation scheduling problem in IMGs by relaxing the time correlated constraints of the DOPF. The relaxation is mathematically achieved by replacing the time-coupled constraints with their corresponding long term time averages. This will resolve the time coupling property of DOPF and results in a simpler solution approach. The relaxed DOPF problem can be solved in independent time periods while considering other constraints such as PEVs and security constraints of OPF as well as factories constraints. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, different simulation scenarios have been applied to an 18-bus IMG consisting of PEVs and 12 factories with electrical and thermal loads as well as combined heat and power systems.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2017.2748970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030341","Time-decoupled;dynamic optimal power flow;industrial microgrid;plug-in electric vehicle (PEV)","Cogeneration;Production facilities;Job shop scheduling;Microgrids;Boilers;Thermal factors;Batteries","","6","","30","IEEE","8 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The EPV charging dispatching is modeled as a constraint programming problem under CS power limits, with a fixed charging rate assumed at the start of charging. The routing and charging logic-based benders decomposition (RCLBD) algorithm, based on logic-based benders decomposition, effectively handles binary and continuous variables.

The algorithm successfully provides efficient pick-up and delivery services, minimizing waiting times for customers. It ensures successful routing and charging solutions for all arriving EPVs.

Results indicate that Pd dopant is stably anchored on the  $\text{T}_{\rm Pt}$  site of the PtS2 surface with a  ${E}_{\rm b}$  of −2.34 eV.

In IWPT systems designed for EVs, ferromagnetic structures are used for the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) coils to amplify magnetic coupling while restricting flux leakage. To optimize IWPT, parameters like the shape and size of ferrite cores and coils and the weight of cores are supposed to be prioritized. Researched data depicts that Double-D (DD) coils excel in misalignment tolerance, low flux leakage, and high coupling with respect to circular and rectangular coils. Therefore, this article examines the four different shapes and sizes of ferrite cores for DD coils at the Tx and Rx sides. This work considers the Rectangular-type, S-type, D-type and I-type ferrite-bars. Further, the ANSYS Maxwell 3D is used to analytically observe the coupling coefficient, losses and energy transfer for each structurally different core. The study indicates that the structure, dimensions, and sizes of ferrite bars substantially impact the energy delivered in the wireless power system. For an unshielded arrangement of I-type ferrite core, the optimal coupling coefficient value is achieved as 0.2358, accounting for 17.3346 Watts of core loss when the core volume is 2376000 Cubic mm. However, considering safety parameters, shielding is unavoidable. Hence, as per observations, the shielded I-type ferrite core is optimally better by 6.446% in terms of coupling coefficient while taxing on overall volume.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3462588","Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10681418","Core loss;coupling coefficient;Double-D (DD) coils;ferrite core;inductive wireless power transmission;shielding","Coils;Ferrites;Couplings;Magnetic cores;Aluminum;Magnetic shielding;Electric vehicle charging;Inductive power transmission;Wireless power transmission","","4","","29","CCBY","17 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article focuses on these two problems and proposes two FTC control methods: sequential MPC and sequential model predictive tolerance control. Both methods are implemented by designing a sequential predictive control that first considers the NP voltage balance and then grid current tracking. Through the staggered operation of the two methods, a T-type grid-connected converter with an LCL filter can operate normally after an open-switch fault occurs. Moreover, both methods can achieve the NP voltage balance and excellent grid current outputs, eliminate the time-consuming selection of weighting factors, and reduce the number of calculation loops compared with the traditional model predictive tolerance control, thereby improving the control flexibility. The performance and comparison of the open-switch FTC with respect to the NP voltage oscillations, total harmonic distortion of the grid current, and pole voltage were demonstrated using numerous simulation and experimental results.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2021.3114711","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2019J033); Key R & D Plan of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:20ZDYF2816); State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipment(grant numbers:SKLD20M11); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515010666); Tsinghua University; Velux Fonden(grant numbers:VILLUM Investigator); Center for Research on Microgrids(grant numbers:25920); Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo(grant numbers:FB0008,ACT192013,1210208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552519","Fault-tolerance control (FTC);neutral point (NP) voltage balancing;open-switch fault;sequential model predictive control (SMPC);T-type three-level converters","Circuit faults;Voltage control;Modulation;Switches;Predictive models;Control systems;Predictive control","","26","","35","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is designed to efficiently identify and update the model parameters, and the fitness function for the state variables is designed and solved iteratively to minimize mismatches with the model. The advantages of the proposed method are its fast convergence and ability to determine parameters with high accuracy. These advantages effectively prevent the algorithm from converging to local optima. To achieve the harmonic rejection capability, a sliding discrete Fourier transform (SDFT) algorithm is also proposed to predict the harmonic at each sampling interval; thus, the harmonics are considered in the cost function.

Our strategy targets social engagements by electric vehicle (EV) users who can be incentivized to alter their regular EV usage patterns for supporting the energy system via vehicle-to-grid actions. We consider a TES that contains a multi-energy system comprised of power and gas systems as well as an urban transportation system. Integrated system operators can take emergency measures to coordinate important system assets (e.g., traditional generators, renewable generators, EV fleets) in a sensible and intelligent way, and thereby mitigate the consequences of FDIAs. Specifically, we take a two-stage distributionally robust approach to cope with uncertain FDIAs, with which a moment-based ambiguity set is employed to yield the worst-case uncertainty distribution. We leverage constraint generation-based relaxation to solve the problem iteratively. To demonstrate our strategy's value and practical utilities, we use a coupled urban TES to conduct case studies.

To define the initiative, this article investigates the bidirectional power flow between EVs and the main grid. The article provides a new algorithm framework for energy optimization that enables real-time decision making to facilitate charge/discharge processes in grid connected mode. Accordingly, the energy flow optimization, communications for data exchange, and local controller are joined to support system reliability for both power grid and EV owners at parking lot sites. The local controller is the key component that collects the EV data for decision making through real-time communications with EV platforms. The main responsibility of this controller is managing the energy flow during the process of real-time charging without impacting the basic functionalities of both grid and EV systems.

This paper devotes laboratory evaluation of the developed schemes and demonstrate key features experimentally on inter-phase power management. Two main experiments have been carried out to confirm that the developed technique can use the surplus power capacity from one phase to support the load demand in another phase to achieve dynamic power balance. From the point view of the substation transformer, the three-phases will always appear to be balanced despite the fact that different phases can have very different local generation and load profiles.","2687-7910","","10.1109/OAJPE.2022.3156761","NSERC Discovery Grants Program(grant numbers:RGPIN-2018-05654); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9727177","Single-phase microgrids;inter-phase power management;unbalanced systems;back-to-back converter","Microgrids;Power system management;Transformers;Substations;Inverters;Hardware;Topology;Power system planning;Energy management","","3","","24","CCBY","3 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, detailed treatment of PEV charging is necessary for efficient allocation of resources. It is envisaged that a coordinator of charging schedules, i.e., a PEV aggregator, could exercise some form of load control according to electricity market prices and network charges. In this context, it is important to consider the effects of uncertainty of key input parameters to optimization algorithms for PEV charging schedules. However, the modeling of the PEV aggregator's exposure to profit volatility has received less attention in detail. Hence, this paper develops a methodology to maximize PEV aggregator profits taking decisions in day-ahead and balancing markets while considering risk aversion. Under uncertain market prices and fleet mobility, the proposed two-stage linear stochastic program finds optimal PEV charging schedules at the vehicle level. A case study highlights the effects of including the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) term in the objective function and calculates two metrics referred to as the expected value of aggregation and flexibility.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2330375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847245","Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR);optimal PEV charging schedule;plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) aggregator;risk aversion;stochastic linear programming","Uncertainty;Vehicles;Stochastic processes;System-on-chip;Electricity supply industry;Power systems;Availability","","91","","44","IEEE","1 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The coordination becomes more challenging when the EV owners have different charging preferences. To tackle this problem, a hybrid centralized-decentralized charging control scheme is designed in this paper which mainly includes three parts, as follows. On the centralized charging side, an offline optimal scheduling approach is first presented, aiming at minimizing the energy cost while satisfying the charging requirements of EVs. To deal with the system dynamics and uncertainties, a model predictive control-based adaptive scheduling strategy is then developed to determine the near optimal EV charging profiles in real time. On the decentralized charging side, the interactions between EVs and the charging system controller is modeled as a leader-follower noncooperative Stackelberg game in which the system controller acts as the leader and the EVs act as followers. The existence of the equilibrium state and its optimality are proved and analyzed. It is shown that by adopting the proposed decentralized charging algorithm, the communication burden between EVs and the system controller is low and that the charging scheme is robust to poor communication channels. Last, we investigate how the size of these two charging groups impacts the system utility and propose an algorithm maximizing the total revenues of the whole system. Simulation results evaluate the performances of the scheme and investigate the parameters' impacts on the system utilities.

In recent times, the world’s growing population, increasing energy needs, technological advancements, environmental concerns, and global climate change have led to a rise in the demand for electric energy. One significant solution to meeting this energy demand is the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) in power systems. However, integrating RESs has made the construction of power systems more complex. Moreover, Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) stand out as a highly promising technology for reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector, aligning with the global Net-zero target. The optimal power flow (OPF) is a challenging problem when dealing with integrating renewable energy sources (RESs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into modern power systems. In this paper, we address the OPF problem that arises from power systems with a high penetration of controllable renewable sources and PEVs. We simulate uncertain solar irradiance, wind speed, and PEV behavior using Weibull, lognormal, and normal probability distribution functions (PDFs) respectively. The proposed stochastic OPF problem, which incorporates controllable renewable sources and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, is addressed using the hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm (AHMRFO). The AHMRFO hybrid algorithm combines the exploratory power of the manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) with the exploiting strength of artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) resulting in a more balanced, robust, and efficient optimization tool. It can effectively handle complex problems, avoid premature convergence, and provide high-quality solutions across a wide range of optimization challenges. Initial evaluations for the proposed algorithm are executed on 7 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) test functions and its obtained results was compared with recent optimization algorithms such as original MRFO, AHA, supply demand-based optimization (SDO), hunter prey optimization (HPO), weighted mean of vectors (INFO), and northern goshawk optimization (NGO). Moreover, simulations carried out on different test systems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AHMRFO algorithm when compared to other algorithms such as the MRFO and AHA. The AHMRFO technique proves to be highly effective, yielding the lowest fitness values of 781.5836  ${\$}$ /h and 808.3611  ${\$}$ /h in the first two scenarios for the modified IEEE 30-bus system with RES and it has the minimum fitness values of 790.2783  ${\$}$ /h and 819.6573  ${\$}$ /h in their respective scenarios for the modified IEEE 30-bus system with stochastic Vehicle-to-grid and RES. These results highlight the precision and strength of AHMRFO technique in effectively addressing various instances of the OPF problem. Additionally, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test has been employed to demonstrate the superiority, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed AHMRFO algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3496123","Scientific Research Deanship at the University of Hail, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:RG-23 172); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750802","Plug-in electric vehicle;optimal power flow;manta ray foraging optimization;renewable energy sources;V2G;artificial hummingbird algorithm","Plug-in electric vehicles;Renewable energy sources;Vehicle-to-grid;Climate change;Power system reliability;Environmental factors;Carbon emissions;Renewable energy sources;Load flow analysis;Stochastic processes;Evolutionary computation;Optimization methods;Wind speed;Solar irradiance","","9","","63","CCBYNCND","12 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For hairpin windings, the options of variable conductor sizes in one slot are also investigated. The comparison results reveal that heavy duty applications will push hairpin winding solutions towards higher number of slots-per-pole-per-phase (q) for more balanced power loss distributions. This balanced loss distribution further simplifies the cooling strategy, making it unnecessary to employ more complex shaft cooling systems.

In this case, each electric vehicle (EV) user needs to decide which path to take (i.e., the routing problem) and where and how much to charge/discharge its battery at the charging stations in the chosen path (i.e., the charging scheduling problem) such that its journey can be accomplished with the minimum monetary cost and time delay. From the system operator's perspective, we formulate a joint routing and charging scheduling optimization problem for an IoEV network, and show that the problem is NP-hard in general. To tackle the NP-hardness, we propose an approximate algorithm that can achieve affordable computational complexity in large-size IoEV networks. The proposed algorithm allows the routing and charging solution to be calculated in a distributed manner by the system operator and EV users, which can effectively reduce the computational complexity at the system operator and protect the EV users' privacy and autonomy.

Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) is a well-studied problem, for bringing solutions to reduce the losses and demand along the distribution lines. The current VVO, however, does not acknowledge the role of elastic and inelastic loads, EVs, and RESs to reduce the reactive power losses and hence the cost of generation. We propose a mathematical model Volt-VAR and CVR optimization (VVCO)/optimal energy consumption model (OECM) to solve the VVO problem by considering load shifting, EV as the storage and carrier of the energy, and use of RES. The VVCO/OECM not only reduces the reactive load but also flatten the load curve to reduce the uncertainty in the generation and to decrease the cost. The system also considers the efficiency of the electrical equipment to enhance the lifetime of the devices. We develop a non-cooperative game to solve the VVCO/OECM problem. To evaluate the performance, we simulate the VVCO/OECM model and compare with the existing VVO solution. We found that our method took almost a constant time to produce a solution of VVO regardless of the size of the network. The proposed method also outperform the existing VVO solution by reducing the generation cost and flatten the load and minimizes the uncertainty in the power generation.

To increase the PEV penetration level with minimal negative impact, the dynamical PEV travel behaviors and charging demand need to be better understood. This paper presents a Markov-based analytical approach for modeling PEV travel behaviors and charging demand. The travel behaviors of individual PEVs are expressed mathematically through Monte Carlo simulation considering two essential factors: temporal travel purposes and state of charge (SoC). Markov model and hidden Markov model (HMM) are adopted to explicitly formulate the probabilistic correlation between multiple PEV states and SoC ranges. This modeling approach provides an efficient and generic tool for analyzing PEV travel behaviors and charging demand based on available PEV statistics.

Due to the coincidence of such loads, excessive voltage drops may often appear, altering the quality of supply voltage provided to the LV end-users. This work evaluates the effects of residential and other charging stations in parking lots of shopping malls or workplaces on the quality of supply voltage of LV grids.

In the demand response paradigm, electric utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity consumption. In this paper, a dynamic energy management framework, based on highly resolved energy consumption models, is used to simulate automated residential demand response. The models estimate the residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies consumer energy use behavior, thus providing an accurate estimation of the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all of the controllable appliances, including plug-in electric vehicles, is found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures. Recently, time-varying electricity rate plans have been proposed by electric utilities as an incentive to their customers with the objective of re-shaping the aggregate demand. Large-scale simulations are performed to analyze and quantitatively assess the impact of demand response programs using different electricity price structures. Results show that simple time-varying electricity price structures, coupled with large-scale adoption of automated energy management systems, might create pronounced rebound peaks in the aggregate residential demand. To cope with the rebound peaks created by the synchronization of the individual residential demands, innovative electricity price structures-called Multi-TOU and Multi-CPP-are proposed.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2414880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079509","Demand response;electricity pricing;rebound peaks;residential energy management;TOU and CPP","Electricity;Home appliances;Load management;Pricing;Energy consumption;Vehicle dynamics","","340","1","35","IEEE","3 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to rising penetrations of rooftop PV, electric vehicles and demand response programs, forecasting the load of individual and a small group of households is becoming increasingly important. Forecasting the load accurately, however, is considerably more difficult when only a few households are included. A way to mitigate this challenge is to provide a set of scenarios instead of one point forecast, so an operator or utility can consider the full range of behaviors. This paper proposes a novel scenario forecasting approach for residential load using flow-based conditional generative models. Compared to existing scenario forecasting methods, our approach can generate scenarios that are not only able to infer possible future realizations of residential load from the observed historical data but also realistic enough to cover a wide range of behaviors. Particularly, the flow-based models utilize a flow of reversible transformations to maximize the value of conditional density function of future load given the past observations. In order to better capture the complex temporal dependency of the forecasted future load, we extend the structure design for the reversible transformations in flow-based conditional generative models by strengthening the coupling between the output and the conditioning input. The simulation results show the flow-based designs outperform existing methods in scenario forecasting for residential load by providing both more accurate and more diverse scenarios.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2951973","UW College of Engineering Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8892561","Residential load;scenario forecasting;flow-based generative models;continuous-valued side information","Load modeling;Forecasting;Predictive models;Training;Probability density function;Data models;Generative adversarial networks","","35","","45","IEEE","6 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, dimensioning and power management problems are quite complicated and challenging in practice. To address these challenges, this article proposes a bilevel multiobjective design and control framework with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II and fuzzy logic control (FLC) as key components, to obtain an optimal sized HESS and the corresponding optimal real-time power management system based on FLC simultaneously. In particular, a vectorized fuzzy inference system is devised, which allows large-scale fuzzy logic controllers to run in parallel, thereby improving optimization efficiency.

Smart charging represents an approach to make the most of existing infrastructure while satisfying charging needs. The objective of smart charging depends on the business context. Objectives of interest include fair share maximization, electricity cost minimization, peak demand minimization, and load imbalance minimization. During business hours, EV arrivals and departures are predictable while still containing uncertainty. To utilize this knowledge ahead of time, this paper presents a novel approach for combining day-ahead and real-time planning for smart charging. First, we model the problem using mixed-integer programming for day-ahead planning to precompute schedules. Next, we propose a schedule guided heuristic which takes as input precomputed schedules and adapts them in real time as new information arrives. Both methods use a parameterized weighting mechanism to flexibly combine and emphasize individual objectives of smart charging. Experimental results from simulations show significant benefits of combining day-ahead and real-time planning over using a single planning approach in isolation.

Extensive literatures have developed various stability regions for the centralized driving vehicle (CDV). However, seldom of them make a thorough analysis of the stability for distributed driving electric vehicle (DDEV). Especially when the direct yaw moment control (DYC) intervenes, the stability region of DDEV shows a huge difference compared with CDV. So far, most researches on the stability control of DDEV are still based on the traditional CDV stability region, which leads to the conservation of controller design. To this end, a dynamic and analytical stability region of DDEV is firstly developed in this paper. By employing sum of square programming (SOSP) algorithm, we choose a high-order Lyapunov function to make a precise estimation of the stability region. A novel DC shape function is proposed to reduce the conservation of estimation when DYC involves. To ensure the real-time performance for control application, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed to fit the coefficients of Lyapunov function, as well as enable the dynamic shifting with driving conditions. Based on the aforementioned stability region, we develop a MPC controller to ensure the stability and tracking performance during handling limit. Both simulations and road tests demonstrate that the developed stability region could effectively restraint the vehicle states from diverging, which enhances vehicle maneuverability while ensuring vehicle stability. Note to Practitioners—Handling stability is a crucial factor which concerns the safety of vehicle. Almost all vehicles should be equipped with active safety system, such as Electronic Stability Program (ESP) of Bosch and Electronic Stability Controller (ESC) of GM. They collect the real-time vehicle states by the Built-in sensors. Meanwhile, they calculate the current stability margin according to the driver’s control input and analyze the deviation of the vehicle states to decide whether the active control is needed to maintain the stability of vehicle. This system is established well in CDV. However, for DDEV, it has another input of DYC in addition to wheel steering angle, which changes the dynamic characteristic of vehicle. This means that the stability margin of traditional ESP is inaccurate when the DYC intervenes, which will lead to the misjudgment of instability or the unsafety of vehicle. This paper develops an analytic stability region of DDEV and describes the stability margin with different values of DYC, which could adapt to varying conditions. This technology fills the gap of the stability determination of DDEV and has a good application prospect in the active safety system of DDEV.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3333393","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52025121,51975118); Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control of China(grant numbers:20210104); Foundation State Key Laboratory of Automobile Safety and Energy Saving of China(grant numbers:KFZ2201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10328909","Distributed driving electric vehicle;sum of square programming;stability region;handling limit","Stability criteria;Thermal stability;Numerical stability;Power system stability;Vehicle dynamics;Tires;Lyapunov methods","","8","","49","IEEE","27 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Achieving an acceptable level of service will require an extensive upgrade for power networks. However, it is necessary to make sure that existing charging resources are efficiently utilized before taking such expensive decision. In this paper, we provide a user-oriented EV control scheme based on the efficient assignment of EVs to charging stations. The key performance indicator is the average time spent by the user from requesting the charging service to accessing it. Our direction is thus opposing to that of the majority of EV-related studies which sacrifice user convenience for achieving utility benefits. The methodology we use depends on defining a queueing model to facilitate the management of a dynamic population of EVs, then developing an EV assignment algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization method.

On the one hand, the high penetration level of EVs will bring potential risks to the electricity grids. On the other hand, EVs can enhance the flexibility of the grids via vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. With the advancement of digitalization and communication technologies, the concept of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) has emerged, which can provide an alternative charging way for EVs to relieve the charging overload problem in the power systems. In this article, we present a data-driven matching protocol for V2V energy management. First, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to learn the long-term reward of the matching action based on the formulated Markov decision process (MDP) at an offline stage. To protect the private information of the EV owners, a federated learning framework is proposed where the cooperation between different EV aggregators can be realized without sharing sensitive information. At the online matching stage, a matching optimization model is established and is converted into a bipartite graph problem to enhance the computation efficiency. The proposed methodology is verified in case studies. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology can help EV owners save costs and increase revenues while hedging the trading risks. Besides, the local energy self-sufficiency is increased, indicating that less burden is brought to the electricity network.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2022.3188766","Australian Research Council (ARC) through the Research Hub(grant numbers:IH180100020); ARC Training Center(grant numbers:IC200100023); ARC Linkage Project(grant numbers:LP200100056); ARC(grant numbers:DP220103881); Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program)(grant numbers:71931003,72061147004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72171206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816029","Distributed cloud computing;internet data centers;transactive energy market;virtual energy storage","Vehicle-to-grid;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Data centers;Transactive energy;Energy storage;Privacy","","19","","39","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The application of CEVs triggers the transportability and sustainability of smart cities, especially for ride-sharing and dynamic scheduling operations. Additionally, the combined optimization of the application of these schemes can further contribute to the potential benefits in smart cities. In this article, an online CEV system for joint ride-sharing and dynamic vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling is proposed. Specifically, the joint problem is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. To deal with the forecast uncertainties, an online scheduling problem is thereby formulated, which also accounts for the communication effect to the real-time interactions. In the meantime, a bi-level system algorithm is devised to coordinate the CEV operations through the Benders’ decomposition. The case studies demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively provide high-quality citywise ride-sharing and V2G regulation services through reliable vehicular communications.

Furthermore, coordination with the load profile enables storage for use at a later time or selling the excess energy to the grid.

This is referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key milestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation sectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully, then contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could in fact be counterproductive to it. This occurs due to two phenomena operating in tandem — the randomness of EV usage patterns and the possibility of strategic behavior by EV users. We present a market-based solution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy storage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a fleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them for storage, and satisfy the demand at the minimum possible cost.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2022.3145689","Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology(grant numbers:Award 7207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690618","Energy storage markest;electric vehicles;stochastic valuations;incentive compatible mechanism","Costs;ISO;Batteries;Generators;Real-time systems;Schedules;Uncertainty","","11","","19","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to experimentally study how the shallow traps influence the generation of diffuse DBD in air and to explore the mechanism of extraordinary extinguishment in Townsend DBD, thermally stimulated current measurements were performed. It was found the trap level of two types of ceramics was 0.34-0.36 eV, lower than 0.61 eV of quartz, which made it more easily to desorb trapped electrons for the ceramics. There was 280.8 nC of trap charge in GTT ceramics, which was much more than that in common ceramics (38.3 nC) and quartz (15.12 nC). Pulse electroacoustic measurement also indicated that GTT ceramics could acquire more seeds electrons with a longer decay time than the other two dielectrics. Scanning electron microscope observations clearly demonstrated denser distribution and better dispersion of grains in GTT ceramics surface, as was supposed to be the reason why it behaved better than other dielectrics. The results prove that there exist shallow traps in dielectric surface, which could offer seed electrons for generation of diffuse DBD.

For each driving pattern, characteristic parameter data that could better featured driving cycles are extracted effectively and used to train NN. The predictive information combined with its error is subsequently used for power distribution. Then, to deal with different dynamics of battery and supercapacitor systems, a frequency splitter is used and its frequency is further optimized by a particle swarm optimization algorithm to minimize the total cost including battery degradation and system energy for each driving pattern. Based on these efforts, a real-time predictive power management control strategy is finally proposed. To verify its effectiveness, simulation has been conducted to compare with the state-of-the-art control strategy under a speed profile composing of five standard driving cycles.

The advantages are that they include complimentary technologies with both high power and energy capabilities. HESS have the potential to be useful to the bulk power systems, for example to increase the value of energy produced by variable generation resource through enabling participation in ancillary service markets. Actualizing the benefits of HESSs requires optimizing the combined ramping capability of aggregated HESS resources. To provide quality ancillary service, source of HESSs locating at multiple sites of variable generation resource must be optimally sized and cohesively controlled. Optimizing aggregated resources can be formulated as an optimization problem. Successfully solving this problem not only requires using effective solution methods but also depends on accurately and rapidly setting the necessary parameters in the problem formula. This article proposes a novel framework with double-layer structure to solve the optimization problem of aggregating ramping capability. Program developed on the upper layer focuses on solving the optimization of aggregating ramping capability among multiple HESSs and is compatible with most existing optimization algorithms.

Despite limitations on gap distance, CPT has been shown to be viable in kilowatt power level applications. This paper provides a critical comparison of IPT and CPT for small gap applications, wherein the theoretical and empirical limitations of each approach are established.

In this work, we aim to study the routing and charging scheduling problem of IoEVs with the constraint of power limit. This paper proposes a clustered rolling framework and a mathematical model for the IoEVs optimal routing and charging problem to minimize the waiting time of customers and get a good converge ratio of the energy block with power limit. This framework can effectively deal with the multi-step pickup and delivery of each vehicle over the time horizon in a dynamic environment. We give a criterion to judge whether pickup and delivery tasks can be assigned to the IoEV. Then, we design a new rectangle packing method for IoEV charging dispatch with the constraint of power limit. Moreover, we consider that the charging process of IoEVs cannot be interrupted before IoEVs meet the electricity demand. We propose the IoEV Routing and Charging Algorithm and analyze its computational complexity. Simulation results show that IoEVs can offer the shuttle service to customers with the minimum waiting time and IoEV charging energy block has a good coverage ratio of the total energy block.

However, various privacy and security issues arise frequently in the energy interaction between EVs and the smart grid (SG), such as the lack of secure authentication and disclosure of EVs’ identity. Although many crypto-based schemes are proposed to achieve secure authentication of V2G networks, they rely on certificate authority (CA) or private key generator (PKG). In response to this problem, some certificateless signature-based schemes have been proposed. Nevertheless, most of them are not suitable for V2G networks due to the high computational cost and communication overhead, and they do not consider the problem of tracking illegal signatures. Therefore, we propose a traceable and privacy-preserving authentication scheme with supporting batch verification for energy trading in V2G networks. We use the method of binary tree level traversal to quickly track EVs with illegal signatures, which can reduce computational resources.

The battery charging is provided based on a new approach of operating the PFC converter at increased DC-link voltage, as compared to the conventional slow chargers. This implies to the reduced size of DC-link capacitance, as the value of DC-link capacitance varies inversely with respect to the DC-link voltage. The proposed BL Zeta converter has lower device voltage stress, which ensures a high-power density and improved efficiency during charging at the battery end. A buck converter is used to control the battery current during constant current and constant voltage modes. Moreover, the operation of two converters in the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) gives the benefit of fewer sensors as sensing of input side quantities is avoided.

One countermeasure is autonomous load control, in which thermostatic loads and electric vehicle chargers quickly adjust the power consumption based on the grid frequency monitored by themselves without communication. However, testing the impact of such load controls on the frequency in actual power systems is too expensive. Therefore, a laboratory-scale isolated power system was prepared as a test bed to examine autonomous load control based on the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and the frequency deviation to cope with steep frequency fluctuations. Moreover, the experimental system was simulated numerically using MATLAB/Simulink. The experimental and simulation results are comparable, indicating that the simulation can be used to determine the total capacity and threshold when planning the introduction of autonomous control loads. The experimental and simulation results also show that frequency fluctuations can be mitigated by introducing autonomous control loads to the grid, and the response time can be improved by approximately 1 s by controlling the load based on the RoCoF.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3434984","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP23H01640); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10613772","Autonomous load control;demand response;frequency regulation;inertia;rate of change of frequency (RoCoF)","Frequency control;Load flow control;Frequency measurement;Generators;Time-frequency analysis;Power systems;Power demand","","","","38","CCBYNCND","29 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An energy buffering unit is designed and connected to the DWPT inverter. An advanced inverter control strategy is proposed to regulate the inverter’s input and Tx coil currents simultaneously. The proposed solution solely utilizes the existing inverter; no additional conversion unit is needed. A comprehensive analysis of the system operation is presented, including the derivation of expressions for sizing the energy buffer (EB) components and defining the operational boundaries for the inverter’s dual-purpose control.

Recently however, vehicles come from different manufacturers and therefore use different protocols for the transmission of messages. As a result, communication among vehicles become heterogeneous. Because of this, VANETs face problems related to security and performance. To address this, some heterogeneous vehicular communication-based schemes have been proposed. However, they do not perform well because of an increase in computational overhead. In order to resolve this, we propose a certificateless cryptosystem (CLC) and public key infrastructure (PKI)-based conditional privacy-preserving hybrid signcryption (CP-CPPHSC) scheme. This scheme utilizes bilinear pairings and provides security requirements in a single logical step. Through the CP-CPPHSC scheme, a message is transmitted by a vehicle using the CLC to a vehicle using the PKI. Additionally, the CP-CPPHSC scheme supports the batch unsigncryption method which helps a vehicle to unsigncrypt more than one messages simultaneously. In the random oracle model (ROM), our scheme ensures existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) with respect to a hardness assumption of q-strong Diffie-Hellman (q-SDH) and modified inverse computational Diffie-Hellman (mICDH) problems and indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) with respect to a hardness assumption of q-bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion (q-BDHI) problem.

However, the information has much to do with privacy of the EVs. The issue of how to solve the contradictory needs of privacy protection and information report is a challenging problem in the V2G network. This paper proposed a privacy preserving authentication mechanism together with a key exchange between the EVs and the LAGs, in which the EVs do not use any pseudonyms.

Nevertheless, the task of optimal electric vehicle charging scales unfavorably with the fleet size and the number of control periods, especially when distribution grid limitations are enforced. To this end, vehicle charging is first tackled using the recently revived Frank-Wolfe method. The novel decentralized charging protocol has minimal computational requirements from vehicle controllers, enjoys provable acceleration over existing alternatives, enhances the security of the pricing mechanism against data attacks, and protects user privacy. To comply with voltage limits, a network-constrained EV charging problem is subsequently formulated. Leveraging a linearized model for unbalanced distribution grids, the goal is to minimize the power supply cost while respecting critical voltage regulation and substation capacity limitations. Optimizing variables across grid nodes is accomplished by exchanging information only between neighboring buses via the alternating direction method of multipliers.

Active battery/ultracapacitor hybrid ESS provides a better solution in terms of efficient power management and control flexibility. Moreover, the voltage of the battery pack can be selected to be different than that of the ultracapacitor, which will result in flexibility of design as well as cost and size reduction of the battery pack. In addition, the ultracapacitor bank can supply or recapture a large burst of power and it can be used with high C-rates. Hence, the battery is not subjected to supply peak and sharp power variations, and the stress on the battery will be reduced and the battery lifetime would be increased.

Predicting LIB degradation in real time remains a critical challenge, directly affecting the economics and reliability of grid-scale applications. Existing degradation models typically depend on costly and time-consuming laboratory-based cycling tests, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Real-Time Degradation Model (ARDM) that addresses these limitations by eliminating the need for experimental pre-cycling and instead relying solely on real-time operational data and manufacturer datasheet parameters. The ARDM uniquely and continuously adapts its modeling parameters during live operation, accounting for key stress factors such as depth of discharge, charge/discharge rates, and temperature. Unlike traditional static models, the ARDM is chemistry-agnostic, requiring no prior calibration and achieving degradation prediction errors of less than 0.0005%, representing a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental validation on two commercial LIBs under diverse stress conditions confirms the model’s accuracy, adaptability, and robustness. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that ARDM not only outperforms benchmark models but also offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for degradation-aware energy management in grid and electric vehicle applications. This work presents a significant advancement toward practical, real-time LIB health monitoring, empowering energy storage service providers and grid planners with a reliable tool for optimizing battery life, cost-efficiency, and operational decisions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3599496","Sustainable Energy Technologies Center, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11126877","Lithium-ion batteries;degradation modeling;grid energy storage;adaptive real-time modeling;battery lifetime estimation;renewable energy integration","Degradation;Batteries;Adaptation models;Aging;Real-time systems;Stress;US Department of Defense;Accuracy;Biological system modeling;Temperature","","2","","36","CCBYNCND","15 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, open channels can be vulnerable to various attacks by a malicious adversary. Therefore, secure mutual authentication for V2G has become essential, and numerous related protocols have been proposed. In 2018, Shen et al. proposed a privacy-preserving and lightweight key agreement protocol for V2G in SIoT to ensure security. However, we demonstrate that their protocol does not withstand impersonation, privileged-insider, and offline password guessing attacks, and it does not also guarantee secure mutual authentication, session key security, and perfect forward secrecy. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic privacy-preserving and lightweight key agreement protocol for V2G in SIoT to resolve the security weaknesses of Shen et al.'s protocol. The proposed protocol resists several attacks including impersonation, offline password guessing, man-in-the-middle, replay, and trace attacks, ensures anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, session key security, and secure mutual authentication. We evaluate the security of the proposed protocol using formal security analysis under the broadly-accepted real-or-random (ROR) model, secure mutual authentication proof using the widely-accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, informal (non-mathematical) security analysis, and also the formal security verification using the broadly-accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool. We then compare computation costs, and security and functionality features of the proposed protocol with related protocols. Overall, the proposed protocol provides superior security, and it can be efficiently deployed to practical SIoT-based V2G environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921399","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:2017R1A2B1002147); BK21 Plus Project; Ministry of Education, South Korea(grant numbers:21A20131600011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732338","Social Internet of Things (SIoT);vehicle-to-grid (V2G);authentication;AVISPA;formal security;key management","Protocols;Vehicle-to-grid;Authentication;Internet of Things;Password","","55","","58","OAPA","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since electric vehicles (EVs) need to provide their private information to aggregators/servers when charging/discharging at different charging stations, privacy of the vehicle owners can be compromised if the information is misused, traced, or revealed. In a wide V2G network, where vehicles can move outside of their home network to visiting networks, security and privacy become even more challenging due to untrusted entities in the visiting networks. Although some privacy-preserving solutions were proposed in the literature to tackle this problem, they do not protect against well-known security attacks and generate a huge overhead. Therefore, we propose a mutual authentication scheme to preserve privacy of the EV's information from aggregators/servers in the home as well as distributed visiting V2G networks. Our scheme, based on a bilinear pairing technique with an accumulator performing batch verification, yields higher system efficiency, defeats various security attacks, and maintains untraceability, forward privacy, and identity anonymity.

In this study, a portion of the rotor structure is replaced with an Interior PM (IPM) rotor so that an axially segmented integration of IPM and SyRM is obtained. Thus, the PMs design is performed specifically in the IPM segment independent of the SyRM scheme, while the SyRM segment remains PM-less. The main motivation of this concept is to improve the contribution of the PM material in the total torque as well as utilizing the special property of the proposed rotor configuration for pulsating torque reduction. A computationally cost-effective algorithm is proposed for the optimal design of IPM-SyRM motor by which a low-power design is carried out for a lightweight electric vehicle.

Furthermore, downstream prediction tasks are conducted to establish the comparability between using the original data and the synthetic data, revealing no significant differences. Moreover, the risk of possible information leakage from synthetic data about original data is evaluated by performing membership inference attacks and population attacks on the prediction models that are trained with synthetic data.

To solve the above problems, a dual-channel high-power WPT system based on bilateral coil decoupling is proposed in this article.

To ensure accuracy in planning, there is a need for an accurate prediction model for both total power and EV charging profiles. Therefore, deep learning methods are used together with signal processing techniques to accurately predict aggregated power consumption and decompose the EV from it.

We show that this decision problem is equivalent to finding the shortest path on an “extended” transportation graph, with virtual arcs that represent charging options. Using this extended graph, we study the collective effects of a large number of EV owners individually solving this path planning problem. We propose a scheme in which independent power and transportation system operators can collaborate to manage each network towards a socially optimum operating point while keeping the operational data of each system private.

Although it is generally infeasible for EVs to dictate their routes, we can design AV travel plans to fulfill certain system-wide objectives. In this paper, we focus on the AVs looking for parking and study how they can be led to appropriate parking facilities to support V2G services. We formulate the coordinated parking problem (CPP), which can be solved by a standard integer linear program solver but requires long computational time. To make it more practical, we develop a distributed algorithm to address CPP based on dual decomposition. We carry out a series of simulations to evaluate the proposed solution methods. Our results show that the distributed algorithm can produce nearly optimal solutions with substantially less computational time. A coarser time scale can improve computational time but degrade the solution quality resulting in possible infeasible solution. Even with communication loss, the distributed algorithm can still perform well and converge with only little degradation in speed.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2017.2655299","Theme-Based Research Scheme of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:T23-701/14-N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822948","Autonomous vehicle;coordinated parking;smart city;vehicle-to-grid","Roads;Distributed algorithms;Batteries;Autonomous vehicles;Automobiles;Industries","","57","","41","IEEE","18 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To prevent side effects on the power system owing to the uncertainty, the VPP should manage its internal resources' uncertainty as a whole. This paper proposes an optimal operation strategy for a VPP participating in day-ahead and real-time energy market so that a distributed energy resource aggregation (DERA) can cope with real-time fluctuation due to uncertainties while achieving its maximum profit. The proposed approach has bidding models of the DERAs including microgrid, electric vehicle aggregation, and demand response aggregation, as well as the VPP. The VPP determines internal prices applied to the DERA by evaluating its real-time responses to the day-ahead schedule and updating proposed pricing function parameters, and the DERA adjusts its energy reserves. By repeating this coordination process, the VPP can establish an optimal operation strategy to manage real-time uncertainty on the DERA's own. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by identifying a capability of the DERA to cope with real-time fluctuation through scenario-based simulations. The result shows that the VPP can reduce 1.6% of cost while the internal price applied to the DERA is close to the maximum.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3072550","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea(grant numbers:20194310100030); Energy Cloud Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT(grant numbers:2019M3F2A1073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9400355","Virtual power plant;distributed energy resource aggregation;electricity market;uncertainty;real-time dispatch","Uncertainty;Real-time systems;Biological system modeling;Power generation;Dams;Optimization;Renewable energy sources","","41","","34","CCBYNCND","12 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wider applications of battery storage systems call for smarter and more flexible deployment models to improve their economic viability. Here we propose a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) model that flexibly coordinates both portable energy storage systems (PESSs) and stationary energy storage systems (SESSs) in a grid. PESSs are batteries and power conversion systems loaded on vehicles that travel between grid nodes with price differences to alleviate grid congestion. PESSs can charge/discharge at grid nodes or swap (part of) batteries with SESSs for profit maximization. We introduce a spatiotemporal decision-making framework for HESS including the planning of SESS and the on- demand dispatch of PESS. We propose a two-phase decision-making algorithm (TPDM), where the first phase uses a spatiotemporal cost-effectiveness aggregation method to determine the optimal SESS location; the second phase shapes a low-complexity solution space by arc destroying and repairing. The results show that HESS achieves significant arbitrage benefit improvement in 86.3% of the operating periods through a year compared with SESS and PESS alone. Compared with commercial solver, the proposed TPDM, on average, can reduce the computational time by 95.5% with an optimality of 1.04%. Note to Practitioners—Battery storage and electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in renewable energy integration and in shaping a low-carbon and sustainable energy and transportation systems. To achieve efficient and scalable management of battery storage across energy and transportation systems, we incorporate the portable energy storage (i.e., batteries transported by vehicles) and stationary energy storage (i.e., batteries placed at grids), into a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), and develop efficient planning framework and scheduling algorithms. Specifically, the proposed methods can provide decision supports for the owners of battery assets to determine the optimal SESS location and for the high-quality coordination of battery charging, swapping, and routing in a HESS. Our methods also have potentials in the on- demand applications of battery storage and EVs across energy and transportation systems, such as ancillary services, grid investment deferral, and battery trading and sharing.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3292189","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB2405600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72271008,72131001,T2121002,52277092); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-2309667); Alibaba DAMO Academy(grant numbers:AGR00022274); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10192528","Hybrid energy storage system;battery swapping;inventory routing;spatiotemporal arbitrage","Batteries;Schedules;Costs;Biological system modeling;Renewable energy sources;Transportation;Routing","","18","","41","IEEE","24 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional AC power systems can scarcely meet the development demand of new DC trends, especially since both the generation side and load side are comprised of DC-based electronic power components. With this background, low voltage direct current supply and utilization system (LVDCSUS) has attracted more and more attention for its great advantages over an AC grid to overcome challenges in operation, reliability, and energy loss in renewable energy connection, DC load power utilization and a number of other aspects. However, the definition of the LVDCSUS is still not clear even though many demonstration projects have been put into planning and operation.

Therefore, a guiding approach is imperative to maintain the coil alignment within an acceptable range. In this paper, a vision-based misalignment detection method is proposed to improve the stability of the system output power and the efficiency. First, the relationships among the system efficiency, output power and mutual inductance were derived in theory. Second, the relationship between the mutual inductance and the misalignment was modeled and simulated using ANSYS Maxwell software. Third, image detection of the ground guideline was used to locate the transmitter coil, and thus obtain the accurate misalignments online. Based on the acquired misalignments, the output power can be rapidly and precisely regulated to the desired value. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately acquire the coil misalignments and then rapidly regulate the system output power in comparison with the conventional discrete proportional-integral control algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2989466","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803268); Science and Technology Plan Project of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20170412110241478); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9075994","Dynamic wireless power transfer;machine vision;power control;mutual inductance estimation","Inductance;Transmitters;Receivers;Power generation;Wireless power transfer;Estimation;Real-time systems","","16","","36","CCBY","22 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, coordinated operations of AVs can potentially enhance the quality of public services, e.g., logistic and AV charging services. However, the joint logistic and AV charging scenario involves the sophisticated interactions between a large number of complicated agents, dynamic logistics, and electricity prices in real-world systems. Since AVs are individuals owned by different parties, the design of attractive incentive to motivate them to provide multiple public services becomes a fundamental issue. In this article, we develop an urban intelligent system (UIS) by exploiting the efficient incentive mechanisms, e.g., noncooperative and cooperative game-theoretic approaches, to motivate the AVs to provide logistic and charging services in UIS. For the noncooperative game approach, we formulate the interaction between the selfish AVs and the aggregator as a Stackelberg game. Meanwhile, the aggregator, known as the leader in the game, aims to decide the logistic and electricity trading prices, and then the AVs, executed as the followers, determine their service schedules. Furthermore, considering that all the players are willing to cooperate, we develop a cooperative potential game for the selfless AVs to maximize the social welfare of the UIS. These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of proposed incentive mechanisms that can motivate EVs to provide high-quality logistic and charging services by maximizing their utilities. Also, both the proposed schemes provide significant system revenues than that of conventional system optimization-based approaches.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3244550","Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20220815111111002); General Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2021KQNCX078); General Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2023A1515011542); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001203); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Project(grant numbers:2021B1515120067); Australian Research Council’s Discovery Project(grant numbers:DP210102169,DP230100603); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044214","Autonomous vehicles (AVs);frequency regulation;game theory;intelligent transportation systems (ITSs);logistic service;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Logistics;Games;Vehicle dynamics;Transportation;Pricing;Smart cities;Power system dynamics","","1","","52","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional power flow (PF) approaches such as forward-backward sweep (FBS) and Newton-Raphson require a high number of iterations to solve non-linear PF equations making them computationally very intensive. PF is the most important study performed by utility, required in all stages of the power system, especially in operations and planning. This paper discusses the applications of deep learning (DL) to predict PF solutions for three-phase unbalanced power distribution grids. Three deep neural networks (DNNs); Radial Basis Function Network (RBFnet), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are proposed in this paper to predict PF solutions. The strength of the proposed DNN models over the traditional iterative-based PF solvers is that these models can capture the nonlinear relationships in PF calculations to accurately predict the solutions. The PF problem is formulated as a multi-output regression model where two or more output values are predicted based on the inputs. The training and testing data are generated through the OpenDSS-MATLAB COM interface. These methods are completely data-driven where the training relies on reducing the mismatch at each node without the need for the knowledge of the system. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that the models can accurately predict the PF solutions for the unbalanced distribution grids with mutual coupling and are robust to different R/X ratios, topology changes as well as generation and load variability introduced by the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs). To test the efficacy of the DNN models, they are applied to IEEE 4-node and 123-node test cases, and the American Electric Power (AEP) feeder model. The PF results for RBFnet, MLP, and CNN models are discussed in this paper which demonstrate that all three DNN models provide highly accurate results in predicting PF solutions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3369068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10444519","Power flow analysis;deep neural networks;radial basis function networks;multi-layer perceptron;convolutional neural networks;unbalanced power distribution grids","Mathematical models;Load flow;Load modeling;Predictive models;Power systems;Power distribution;Topology;Radial basis function networks;Convolutional neural networks;Power grids","","23","","53","CCBYNCND","23 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifications for MIPEC designing come out from many considerations concerning traction drive and reference driving cycle, on-board power source and storage unit characteristics. However, to date sizing and configuration of both storage units and on-board generators are directly related to traction drive and driving profile (i.e., vehicle performances and characteristics) and no relation with power electronic interface is considered during preliminary design. Then, power electronic interface is selected in order to fit traction drive requirements with power source and storage unit characteristics; as a consequence converter mode of operation lacks of optimization, as well dynamic behavior and efficiency cannot be maximized.

Reducing energy consumption in buildings toward zero-energy buildings is a vital pillar to ensure that future climate and energy targets are reached. However, due to the high uncertainty of building loads and customer comfort demands, and extremely nonlinear building thermal characteristics, developing an effective zero-energy building energy management (BEM) technology is facing great challenges. This article proposes a novel learning-based and iterative Internet of Things (IoT) system to address these challenges to achieve the zero-energy objective in BEM of connected buildings. First, all buildings in the IoT-based BEM system share their operation data with an aggregator. Second, the aggregator uses these historical data to train a deep reinforcement learning model based on the deep deterministic policy gradient method. The learning model generates precooling or preheating control actions to achieve zero-energy BEM for building heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Third, for solving the coupling problem between HVAC systems and building internal heat gain loads, an iterative optimization algorithm is developed to integrate physics-based and learning-based models to minimize the deviation between the on-site solar photovoltaic generated energy and the actual building energy consumption by properly scheduling building loads, electric vehicle charging cycles, and the energy-storage system. Finally, the optimal load operation scheduling is generated by considering customers’ comfort requirements. All connected buildings then operate their loads based on the load operation schedule issued by the aggregator. The proposed learning-based and iterative IoT system is validated via simulation with real-world building data from the Pecan Street project.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3176306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9778215","Building energy management (BEM);deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG);deep reinforcement learning (DRL);Internet of Things (IoT);zero-energy building","Building management systems;Load modeling;HVAC;Data models;Internet of Things;Energy management;Energy consumption;Climate change;Reinforcement learning;Deep learning","","34","","37","IEEE","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While different techniques have been investigated to resolve this issue, there is still a lack of adequate theoretical foundations to guide these approaches. In this study, a detailed analytical analysis is carried out for a typical North American residential community with single-phase power generation, storage, and high-power random plug-in loads. This analysis has laid the foundation for a class of operating scenarios and provides an essential theoretical basis to unify different techniques for dynamically balancing single-phase microgrids connected to three-phase distribution systems. Detailed formulations have been developed for the first time to draw explicit power transfer relationships among power surplus and power-deficient phases to achieve an overall dynamic balance.

Thus, the efficiency analysis of the inverter/motor is of prime importance for the calculation of the overall efficiency of the drive trains. This paper aims at modeling the efficiencies of the traction motor/controller through efficiency maps. Efficiency maps are a convenient way to represent motor drive systems of large and complex systems, like that of a HEV. The paper uses the advanced vehicle simulator (ADVISOR) software for the simulations of a large-sized car, similar to a Chevy Lumina, over the urban dynamometer-driving schedule and highway fuel economy test drive cycles. Furthermore, the paper investigates the traction motor efficiency maps and consequent overall drive train efficiencies of commercially available Honda Insight and Toyota Prius HEVs.

The higher boost gain ratio and switching loss associated with increasing dc-link voltage, along with gradually increasing power density and efficiency demanded in the next-generation EV power converters, make the conventional boost converter not suitable for 800-V FDC. This article proposes a new design approach in which a zero voltage transition (ZVT) high step-up dual floating output boost converter (DFOBC) is introduced. Due to higher voltage gain, the operating duty cycle of DFOBC is reduced and lies in the vicinity of D = 0.5, which reduces filter size. The ZVT cells greatly reduce switching losses at 300 kHz, which enables using only a single discrete SiC mosfet for the main switch of 25-kW module, contributing to volume and cost reduction. Moreover, the proposed converter successfully demonstrates the possibility of using planar core and printed circuit board (PCB) windings at 100-kW power level, which is rarely seen in previous works. Finally, a 25-kW prototype of the proposed ZVT DFOBC is built and test. The power density of 63 kW/L excluding heatsink is achieved.

However, its adoption in electric vehicle charging has been limited due to the high installation costs, low charging efficiency, and significant power fluctuations. To address these issues, a repeater-based DWPT system with a controllable detuning rate method is proposed to achieve constant output power during movement. The switch-controlled capacitor is introduced in the repeater coil to adjust its detuning rate dynamically. Based on the relationship between the output power and the mutual inductances among the active, repeater, and receiver coils, the detuning rate is controlled to reduce power fluctuations. Moreover, increasing the detuning rate under no-load conditions reduces the losses in the repeater coil. A down-sized experimental prototype of the proposed DWPT system was built, and the experimental results show that it can maintain output power with fluctuations of less than 4.8% and an efficiency of approximately 85% throughout the dynamic process. Furthermore, constant power output is maintained even when the mutual inductance between the repeater coil and the active coil varies by up to 25%.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2025.3544309","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52377202,62192754); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2023JJ30689,2024JJ1011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10897908","Constant power output;controllable detuning rate;dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) system;switch-controlled capacitor","Coils;Repeaters;Receivers;Capacitors;Switches;Inductance;Wireless power transfer;Resistance;Power generation;Costs","","","","26","IEEE","21 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multilevel ZSI uses more number of high-power passive components in the intermediate network, which increase the system size and weight. Also, its input current is discontinuous in nature which is not desirable in some of the applications like fuel cell, UPS systems, hybrid electric vehicle, etc. In this paper, a continuous current input three-level LC-switching-based voltage boost neutral-point-clamped inverter is proposed, which uses comparatively less number of high-power passive components at the same time retains all the advantages of multilevel QZSI/ZSI. It is able to boost the input dc voltage and give required three-level ac output voltage in a single stage. Steady-state analysis of the proposed inverter is discussed to formulate the relationship between the input dc voltage and three-level ac output voltage.

"Impact of EV Battery Chargers on the Power Quality of Distribution Systems","J. C. Gomez; M. M.

The effect of harmonic distortion on the distribution system, especially on distribution transformers, is analyzed. A program was developed that allows the consideration of the transformer life consumption as a function of the battery charger characteristics and charging algorithm. The program is considered to be a distribution planning and management tool. The proposed tool can be easily applied to determine the optimum charging time as a function of the existing load, ambient temperature, and time of day. From the study it can be deduced that a direct connect-and-charge scheme can be detrimental to the transformer life, especially under high temperature and large load. Calculations show the existence of a quadratic relationship between the transformer life consumption and the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the battery charger current. Furthermore, the current THD should be limited to 25 30% in order to have a reasonable transformer life expectancy.","1558-1705","","10.1109/MPER.2002.4311766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4311766","Power quality;electric vehicle;battery charger;harmonics;power distribution system;transformer derating","Batteries;Power quality;Voltage fluctuations;Transformers;Capacitors;Power system harmonics;Power system modeling;Temperature;PSCAD;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","23","","","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
