abstract = {A considerable number of classic and modern control applications in distribution systems are developed aiming at make the most of the existing infrastructure. Under this perspective, investments postponement in grid upgrade appears as a good expectable result. The advent of smart grids enhances this expectation since it promises ubiquitous system monitoring, secure and trustworthy communication technologies and advanced control schemes. These features will allow the implementation of innovative algorithms for better operation and management of system assets. New possibilities arise for DSM, microgeneration control, electric vehicle charging and intelligent operation of energy storage devices. The scientific literature has countless examples that illustrate the benefits of such tools. A frequent outcome of these studies highlights the advantage of investments deferral in network reinforcement. This paper analyzes the combined effects of these control actions with the investments required for network upgrade, namely in lines and transformers reinforcement. Contrary to other research papers, our results demonstrate that investments deferral could lead frequently to higher costs in a long-term perspective.}

abstract = {This study introduces an advanced framework to enhance the integration of wind energy into power systems by utilizing electric vehicles (EVs) as dynamic energy storage units through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. The proposed cooperative model integrates EV aggregators with wind power systems, operating under a single commitment approach with security constraints. Unlike existing studies, this framework incorporates detailed modeling of EV aggregation, accounting for diverse user travel patterns, time-varying energy storage capacities, and the complexities of charging and discharging behaviors. A significant innovation involves demonstrating that prohibitive constraints on simultaneous charging and discharging can, under specific conditions, be relaxed without compromising system stability, thereby simplifying the optimization process. The optimization problem is formulated as a single objective problem and solved using an improved spider monkey optimization algorithm. This algorithm delivers robust convergence, computational efficiency, and highly accurate solutions to complex energy dispatch problems. The framework is validated through extensive case studies on the IEEE system, incorporating realistic wind energy profiles and EV penetration scenarios. The research demonstrates a 28 % improvement in wind energy absorption, a 15 % reduction in thermal unit operating costs, and a substantial mitigation of storage violations under dynamic conditions. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of V2G in balancing renewable energy variability and reducing peak load pressures, showcasing its potential to optimize grid operations and improve reliability.}

The flexibility of a system can be enhanced by using a smart grid comprising demand response, hybrid/diesel generation units and energy storage system. In this paper, an improved flexibility index is defined with the concept of fast reserve supply. The uncertainties of wind/solar power plants and required reserve of thermal units are considered using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). The smart grid supplies a part of load profile of commercial consumers and a part of charge profile of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) through wind and solar virtual power plants (VPPs), responsive loads, distributed generators (DGs) and the energy storage system. Moreover, the PHEVs considered in this paper provide a system with more flexibility. This paper has solved the unit commitment problem in a single-node system that has no transmission constraints. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and the mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) methods have been used in order to solve the unit commitment problem and the smart grid scheduling, respectively. The results show that the presented model can optimize the costs of the system and causes the system to become more flexible.}

Reducing pollution can be realized through optimal planning of charging and discharging of electric vehicles as consumers and storage of electric energy. Also, vehicles connected to the network increase the reliability of the network during power outages. However, the connection of electric vehicles to the grid can also bring limitations. The uncoordinated and unmanaged presence of electric vehicles as an additional load in the network can aggravate problems such as voltage drop, voltage stability and increase in network losses. Consequently, these problems will have economic costs. In this way, the management of charging and discharging of electric vehicles will be of special importance in the future of control and operation of distribution networks. In this article, electric vehicle charging and discharging management has been done in order to minimize the amount of active power loss, bus voltage deviation, increase the stability of the network voltage, and as a result, reduce the costs of the distribution company. For this purpose, a 33-bus distribution network that absorbed its required energy only through the connection point to the network was studied with different scenarios in which the objective function of the problem was different. The proposed algorithm was implemented to calculate the best state of charging and discharging of cars. In choosing these vehicles, it has been tried to examine all charging modes.

However, unregulated battery charging remains a challenge causing high energy costs, power peaks or even blackouts. This paper studies this challenge from a socio-technical perspective: social dynamics such as the participation in demand-response programs, the discomfort experienced by alternative suggested vehicle usage times and even the fairness in terms of how equally discomfort is experienced among the population are highly intertwined with Smart Grid reliability. To address challenges of such a socio-technical nature, this paper introduces a fully decentralized and participatory learning mechanism for privacy-preserving coordinated charging control of electric vehicles that regulates three Smart Grid socio-technical aspects: (i) reliability, (ii) discomfort and (iii) fairness. In contrast to related work, a novel autonomous software agent exclusively uses local knowledge to generate energy demand plans for its vehicle that encode different battery charging regimes. Agents interact to learn and make collective decisions of which plan to execute so that power peaks and energy cost are reduced system-wide. Evaluation with real-world data confirms the improvement of drivers’ comfort and fairness using the proposed planning method, while this improvement is assessed in terms of reliability and cost reduction under a varying number of participating vehicles. These findings have a significant relevance and impact for power utilities and system operator on designing more reliable and socially responsible Smart Grids with high penetration of electric vehicles.}

Achieving accurate LTLF is not only crucial for grid planning and operation but also provides a scientific foundation for power dispatch, ensuring efficient energy use and maintaining supply–demand balance. However, the nonlinearity, periodicity, and temporality of load pose multiple challenges to LTLF. In this paper, a long-term load forecasting model based on a decomposable multi-period mixing algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the features that may affect load are analyzed and selected. Secondly, by combining load decomposition methods with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) structure, a long-term point forecasting approach based on a decomposable multi-period mixing algorithm is proposed. Thirdly, a probabilistic forecasting method is proposed on the basis of this model. This method utilizes a residual simulation technique to quantify the uncertainty of LTLF, effectively complementing the point forecasting results. Finally, the model’s effectiveness is validated across datasets from a Chinese dataset, Australian electricity markets, and GEFCom2014, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy and computational efficiency.}

However, the random charging characteristics of plug-in electric vehicles and the uncertainty of photovoltaics may impose an additional burden on the grid and affect the supply–demand equilibrium. To address this issue, judicious scheduling optimization offers an effective solution. In this study, considering charge and discharge management of plug-in electric vehicles and intermittent photovoltaics, a novel Multi-energy synergy systems scheduling framework is developed for solving grid instability and unreliability issues. This formulates a large-scale mixed-integer problem, which calls for a powerful and effective optimizer. The new binary level-based learning optimization algorithm is proposed to address nonlinear large-scale high-coupling unit commitment problems. To investigate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, numerical experiments have been carried out considering multiple scales of unit numbers and various scenarios. Finally, the results confirm that the proposed scheduling framework is reasonable and effective in solving unit commitment problems, can achieve 3.3% cost reduction and demonstrates superior performance in handling large-scale energy optimization problems. The integration of plug-in electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy generations, and battery energy storage systems is verified to reduce the output power of 192.72 MW units during peak periods to improve grid stability. Therefore, optimizing energy utilization and distribution will become an indispensable part of future power systems.}

Herein, the uncertain EVPLs are integrated into the SCUC problem with the aim of reducing the operation cost. It is notable that growing integration of unspecified EVPLs can introduce novel challenges to the power system, significantly impacting its flexibility. In this study, electric vehicles are leveraged as a means to enhance system flexibility. Meanwhile, the FDI attacks in EVPLs can distort the system’s flexibility and lead to inaccurate assessments of the power system’s ability to adapt to changing conditions. In order to model the FDI attack, a bi-level optimization problem based on mixed integer linear programming is formulated. At the upper level, the impact of EVPLs on the flexibility indices of the SCUC is evaluated, and the false data injected into the EVPL is calculated at the lower level. Since both levels of the proposed FBSCUCFDIP-P/EV include discrete variables, a reformulation and decomposition technique is utilized to achieve the optimal solution. Instead, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based machine learning method is considered to detection and correction of FDI attack. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 24-bus system. The simulation results initially indicate the improvement of the flexibility of the power system in proposed structure. Further, injecting false data into all available EVPLs causes to increase the system operation cost. Besides, false data leads to distorted charging and discharging scheduling of EVPLs; likewise, scheduling and commitment of power generation units also changes. Subsequently, the application of the XGBoost algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of FDI attacks, achieving a maximum accuracy of 85.41%.}

As decentralized prosumers become more integrated into smart grids, innovative coordination methods are required to fully leverage their potential and improve the system's self-healing capabilities. Hence, in this paper, we present a decentralized two-layer model for active distribution networks (ADNs) incorporating commercial energy hubs, Parking lots (PLs), hydrogen refueling stations, and mobile units (MUs). This model aims to maximize the flexible capacities of flexible prosumers under emergencies and includes a dynamic mechanism for transporting hydrogen to refueling stations via trucks. In the first layer of the model, the AND operator provides the required services to flexible prosumers, including commercial energy hubs, PLs and hydrogen refueling stations. During this layer, the movement paths of mobile units, such as battery-based mobile storage units (MSUs) and mobile hydrogen units (MHUs), are determined. In the second layer, prosumers independently plan and decide the extent of their service contributions. Subsequently, with the actual service capacities established, the AND operator re-optimizes the initial planning to finalize the system schedule and precise movement paths of the mobile units. The proposed model was tested on a modified 83-bus distribution network using the CPLEX solver in GAMS. Simulation results demonstrate a 54.9 % reduction in forced load shedding (FLS) due to the dispatch of mobile units and a further 84.4 %% reduction in FLS from leveraging the flexible capacities of commercial energy hubs and PLs.}

This paper proposes a unit commitment model for a V2G system connected to a smart power grid.

The proposed methodology incorporates controlled charging and discharging as well as accounting for battery degradation in the unit commitment problem.

A comparison between a system without V2G and a system with V2G is presented to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach.

Sometimes, it is not possible to install a large capacity of the BESS. On the other hand, the competition of the electricity market has been increased due to the deregulation and liberalization of the power market. Therefore, the power companies are required to reduce the generation cost in order to maximize the profit. In this paper, a thermal units commitment program considers the demand response system to satisfy the transmission constraints. The BESS capacity can be reduced by the demand response system.

abstract = {In recent years, the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events (EWEs) have posed a growing threat to power system resilience. The existing literature has examined the impact of extreme events on power system planning. However, few studies have systematically explored the role of large-scale electric vehicle (EV) fleets toward grid resilience enhancement in EWEs. Therefore, we propose a resilience-oriented power system planning method considering vehicle-to-grid (V2G) coordination, especially amidst blizzard events. A blizzard-induced grid failure model is established for long-term N-K contingency scenario generation, followed by a two-stage generation expansion and line hardening optimization considering both normal and contingency conditions. Three charging modes of EV fleets, i.e., plug and play (PnP), orderly charging (V1G) and V2G, are compared. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, using 2024 data from the Jibei region of northern China and two extreme blizzard scenarios, demonstrate that combining resilience-oriented planning with V2G coordination significantly reduces total system costs by 58.02% compared to the baseline, achieving the lowest total cost of $2.48×103 million. Furthermore, the integrated approach reduces load shedding cost by 87.74% and 77.95% compared to considering only EV coordination or only resilience planning, respectively. These findings highlight the value and novelty of integrating EV flexibility into long-term resilience-oriented power system planning.}

abstract = {Due to environmental and energy security concerns, low emission vehicles present a vital necessity for clean transportation. In particular, electric vehicles (EVs) are the most promising solution due to the fact that the electrical power system is the most ready infrastructure to supply their requirement. Two possible energy delivery solutions to the EVs, namely the charging stations and the battery exchange stations (BESs) are the focus of research nowadays. In this paper, a new optimal operation approach is proposed for the BESs. The proposed new model determines the optimal charging, discharging, and exchange decisions for the battery stock throughout the day taking into consideration the customers’ arrivals, the variations in the grid price, the grid connection limitations, and the self-degradation of the batteries. The objective of the proposed approach is to maximize the BES owner profit while satisfying the EV owners’ requests. The BES operation optimization problem is formulated as mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem and is solved as a day-ahead scheme. The performance of the BES is compared to conventional EV charging stations, where the BES shows superior customer satisfaction and higher profit.}

Therefore, distribution utilities must carry out anticipated operational planning to achieve appropriate and efficient network management. Then, it is necessary to obtain more accurate load forecasts on higher granularity levels than those commonly supervised by the SCADA system, for instance, at distribution transformers. Furthermore, as medium/low voltage profiles are more volatile and uncertain than high voltage profiles and, therefore, more difficult to predict, there is an opportunity to improve their performance at this level. This work proposes a short-term net load forecast model that considers load consumption and PV distributed generation behind the meter. This model is based on an efficient deep learning network that uses novel techniques and architectures implemented in other tasks adapted to the net electric load forecasting problem at an individual and/or low-aggregated level. At the same time, the model can consider information provided by exogenous variables of time and meteorological ones to improve the forecast accuracy. Additionally, the proposed model is extended to a probabilistic approach through Monte Carlo Dropout and kernel density estimation to obtain probability density forecasts. To evaluate the model performance, a dataset from the “Caucete Smart Grid” located in Argentina is used. The results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model through several cases and comparisons with the state-of-the-art models considered.}

Despite the complexity of their protection, as well as the operation of distributed generation resources in the distribution network, factors such as improving reliability, increasing production capacity of the distribution network, stabilizing the voltage of the distribution network, reducing peak clipping losses, as well as economic and environmental considerations, have expanded the influence of distributed generation (DG) resources in the distribution network. The location of DG sources and their capacity are the key factors in the effectiveness of distributed generation in the voltage stability of distribution systems. Nowadays, along with the scattered production sources of electric vehicles with the ability to connect to the network, due to having an energy storage system, they are known as valuable resources that can provide various services to the power system. These vehicles can empower the grid or be used as a storage supply source when parked and connected to the grid. This paper introduces and studies a two-stage planning framework for the concurrent management of many electric vehicles and distributed generation resources with private ownership. In the first stage, the aim is to increase the profit of electric vehicles and distributed generation sources; finally, the purpose is to reduce operating costs. The proposed scheduling framework is tested on a distribution network connected to bus 5 of the RBTS sample network. Besides distributed generation sources and electric vehicles, we integrate time-consistent load management into the system. Due to distributed generation sources such as photovoltaic systems and wind turbines and the studied design in the modeling, we use the Taguchi TOAT algorithm to generate and reduce the scenario to ensure the uncertainty in renewable energy. MATLAB software is used to solve the problem and select the optimal answer.}

Existing literature lacks comprehensive vehicle-to-grid (V2G) impact analyses and methodologies for long-term integration, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, the absence of optimized short-term operational models for EV integration poses challenges in grid management. To bridge these gaps, this research proposes a socio-economic model to estimate EV sales based on the Bass diffusion model and macroeconomic regressions. Additionally, it integrates electricity system expansion planning using the OSeMOSYS tool with a short-term operational model based on unit commitment. In this context, this work endeavors to develop a methodology for estimating the impact of V2G technology, considering both the deployment and utilization of EVs in a Brazilian case study. Applying traditional methodologies that do not consider operational system models can lead to potential future load shedding. It may accentuate disparities between long-term and short-term outcomes, especially with EV and V2G integration. The proposed methodology corrected the overestimation of the energy injection potential of EVs by the traditional model, indicating the need to consider both the expansion and the operation of the electricity system when planning the integration of EVs.}

The proposed HEDQN contains two enhanced deep Q networks, which are utilized to optimize the charging destination and charging route path of EVs, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is simulated and validated in two urban transportation networks. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, single-layer deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and traditional hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the proposed HEDQN algorithm can effectively reduce the total charging cost of electric vehicles and realize online real-time charging navigation of electric vehicles, that shows excellent generalization ability and scalability.}

As charging demand increases, intelligent and data-driven approaches are essential to predict and manage future grid impacts. This paper presents a probabilistic and data-driven approach for generating realistic electric vehicle charging profiles, which can be integrated into probabilistic load flow simulations to assess their effect on grid capacity. In contrast to many existing studies that focus on low-voltage grids, this work targets the sub-transmission grid, analyzing the impact of aggregated charging demand. The approach is applied to a Swedish sub-transmission grid using a combination of real-world data: travel statistics, demographic data, charger usage rates, and two empirical home charging datasets, one representing uncoordinated charging, and another incorporating smart charging technologies. The methodology generates synthetic but realistic charging demand profiles, which are coupled to a full-scale grid model to evaluate the system under 100 % fleet electrification. Results show that substantial congestion may emerge in the primary substation transformers, which may, to some extent, be mitigated by adopting planned or intelligent charging strategies. By combining real-world data with a detailed grid model and a probabilistic modeling approach, the study lays a foundation for analyzing grid impacts under high EV penetration and supports the development of flexibility services to inform more proactive grid planning.}

The centralized operation of SAEVs not only allows large-scale travel demand response but also can provide essential ancillary services to the smart grid through the concept of vehicle-to-grid (V2G). With V2G technology, unused electric vehicles can work as a distributed energy storage facility for the electricity grid to smoothen the intermittent demand. Designing and operating a V2G-enabled SAEV system is challenging. This problem involves complicated planning and operational decisions, as well as time-varying electric tariffs. In this work, a flow-based Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model is formulated for determining the optimal configurations (charging infrastructure and fleet size) and daily operation strategies (serving passengers, relocation, charging/discharging). The developed mathematical model allows for maximizing the total profit, comprising investment cost, revenue from serving passengers, and V2G profit through charging/discharging schedules. A two-stage Benders decomposition-based algorithm is proposed to address the sophisticated ILP problem. Via testing instances in the Manhattan network based on real-world and synthetic data, we have demonstrated the feasibility of our approaches and studied the benefits of integrating V2G in the SAEV system.}

An economic emission analysis of the proposed SMOUC problem with the SGTs is carried out to minimize the total expected operation cost and emission using a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method. A two-stage stochastic programming method is used for dealing with the uncertain nature of power generation from the renewable DGs. Lexicographic optimization in combination with hybrid augmented-weighted ε-constraint method are employed to obtain Pareto optimal solutions of the SMOUC problem, and a fuzzy decision making is applied to select the most preferred non-dominated solution. Besides, mathematical modeling of responsive loads can help the independent system operator (ISO) to use a conservative and reliable model to have lower error in load curve characteristic estimation, such as variation in peak load. In this regard, this paper also contributes to the existing body of knowledge by developing linear and nonlinear economic models of price responsive loads for time-based DRPs (TBDRPs), as well as voluntary and mandatory incentive-based DRPs (IBDRPs) based on the customer’s behavior (CB) concept and price ratio (PR) parameter. Also, new mathematical indices are proposed to choose the most conservative and reliable economic model of price responsive loads. Moreover, different widely used DRPs are analyzed and prioritized using the strategy success index (SSI) from the ISO viewpoint to determine the most effective DRP which has more coordination with the SGTs. The proposed MILP-based SMOUC problem with integrated SGTs, is applied to IEEE 10-unit test system and is implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) environment. Simulation analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating SGTs into the proposed SMOUC problem from the economic, environmental, and technical points of view.}

In view of the coordinated charging of EVs under the photovoltaic (PV) energy connected to the power grid, a collaborative charging control strategy is proposed based on a double deep q-network with Prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER). Specifically, Long–Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is utilized to capture the uncertainties caused by power requirement, PV power, and real-time electricity price. Then, a modified DDQN approach and the corresponding reward function are applied to solve the cooperative charging problem. In addition, the introduction of a PER mechanism based on TD bias sampling in reinforcement learning alleviates the problem of reward sparsity in learning scenarios and improves the training stability and efficiency. The proposed approach can achieve collaborative scheduling of EVs, which helps reduce the charging cost, promote the consumption of PV energy and avoid transformer overload. Simulation case studies based on real data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the charging cost by 30% and increase the PV power utilization by 10% compared to the DDQN algorithm.}

Optimal planning avails itself of the exploitation manner of existing energy resources alongside appropriate employment of demand response (DR) programs and available electric vehicles (EV) in parking lots of immense industrial centers as storage sites in energy management systems in industrial smart grids have been seriously considered. This article introduces a new perspective in the simultaneous use of demand response loads and available electric vehicles in parking lots toward energy management of industrial virtual power plants (IVPPs) aiming at augmenting the system's profits as well as increasing the grid reliability under peak load conditions and cutting down on industrial centers load shedding. The objective function of the problem is formulated within the framework of short-term production planning for distributed energy resources (DER) and conventional ones in conjunction with DR programs and EV in such a way that the IVPPs' profits are maximized. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we have applied and tried on the second zone of IEEE-RTS standard grid. The outcomes accrued from various simulations point to the fact that the presence of EV within the boundaries of EV's parking lots prompts considerable increase in IVPPs' storage amount and consequent decline in exploiting full power grid capacity. Utilizing DR programs for responding load and selecting best scheduling schemes for each IVPP during various times of a day-night cycles will bring about a reduction in operation costs, de-peaking as well as an enhanced performance of EV's parking installations.}

The approach incorporates load-shifting strategies to reduce daily operating costs by redistributing various load components between peak and off-peak periods. The ISSA demonstrates exceptional performance, noted for its rapid response times and strong capability to converge on the global optimum. While modeling hydrogen storage systems (HSS), however, several critical constraints are considered, including operational limits of the electrolyzer, the capacity of the fuel cell (FC), and the storage tank's restrictions. To validate the methodology, the model was applied to a test system comprising smart parking, renewable power plants, and thermal generation, all integrated into the proposed framework for addressing upstream grid price uncertainties.

Smart grids can be a cost-effective solution to overcome increases in energy demand and ensure power security. Current applications of smart grids involve a large numbers of agents (e.g., electric vehicles). Since each agent must interact with other agents when taking decisions (e.g., movement and scheduling), the computational complexity of smart grid systems increases exponentially with the number of agents. Computational tractability of planning is a significant barrier to implementation of large-scale smart grids of electric vehicles. Existing solution approaches such as mixed-integer programming and dynamic programming are not computationally efficient for high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a reformulation of a Mixed-Integer Programming model into a Decentralized Markov Decision Process model and solves it using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to address the scalability issues of large-scale smart grid systems. The Decentralized Markov Decision Process model uses centralized training and distributed execution: agents are trained using a unique actor network for each agent and a shared critic network, and then agent execute actions independently from other agents to reduce computation time. The performance of the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning model is assessed under different configurations of customers and electric vehicles, and compared to the results from deep reinforcement learning and three heuristic algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm can reduce simulation time significantly compared to deep reinforcement learning, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and the artificial fish swarm algorithm. The superior performance of the proposed method indicates that it may be a realistic solution for large-scale implementation.}

Results show that while central business districts are over-served, high-density residential areas such as Ain Shams and Dar Al Salam suffer from significant under-provision. Type 2 connectors dominate the network (77.5 %), leading to functional exclusion for users of CHAdeMO, CCS2, and GB/T vehicles. Vehicle-to-Grid simulation with 40 % vehicle charging participation, representing 5,078 vehicles, demonstrated a potential peak-load reduction of 25.4 MW without requiring additional infrastructure. The proposed framework offers a scalable and transferable model for equitable, resilient, and technically inclusive EV infrastructure planning in rapidly urbanizing regions of the Global South.}

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are widely regarded as valuable assets in the smart grid as distributed energy resources in addition to their primary transportation function. However, connecting EVs to the distribution network and recharging the EV batteries without any control may overload the transformers and cables during peak hours when the penetration of EVs is relatively high. In this study, a two level hierarchical control method for integrating EVs into the distribution network is proposed to coordinate the self-interests and operational constraints of two actors, the EV owner and Distribution system operator (DSO), facilitated by the introduction of the fleet operator (FO) and the grid capacity market operator (CMO). Unlike the typical hierarchical control system where the upper level controller commands the low level unit to execute the actions, in this study, market based control are applied both in the upper and low level of the hierarchical system. Specifically, in the upper level of the hierarchy, distribution system operator uses market based control to coordinate the fleet operator׳s power schedule. In the low level of the hierarchy, the fleet operator use market based control to allocate the charging power to the individual EVs, by using market based control, the proposed method considers the flexibility of EVs through the presence of the response-weighting factor to the shadow price sent out by the FO. Furthermore, to fully demonstrate the coordination behavior of the proposed control strategy, we built a multi-agent system (MAS) that is based on the co-simulation environment of JACK, Matlab and Simulink. A use case of the MAS and the results of running the system are presented to intuitively illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.}

abstract = {Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which enables bidirectional power flow between electric vehicles (EVs) and power grids, is a possible solution for integrating EVs and renewable energy (RE) into the power system. While EV drivers are indispensable components for the V2G applications, the extant power system studies have underexamined the willingness of EV drivers to participate in V2G. In addition, few studies investigate whether the small-scale and time-varying V2G supply can replace utility-level energy storage. Given this background, this study combined discrete choice experiments with energy storage capacity expansion planning (ES-CEP) to simulate time-varying V2G participation and effectiveness. The choice experiments identified drivers’ preferences for V2G, which was used to simulate V2G participation under different compensation schemes. Time-varying V2G participation was integrated into ES-CEP for renewable-dominant power system to assess the potential of V2G to replace ES at the utility scale. The results showed that most drivers were unlikely to engage in V2G, although this reluctance decreased during the night. Higher guaranteed state-of-charge, accessible V2G facilities, and monetary enrollment compensation encouraged the participation. The ES-CEP results showed that, even with a limited V2G (4.5–15.3 % of EV drivers), V2G significantly reduced the optimal ES capacity (36.5–45.6 % for power and 39.6–60.6 % for energy), shaved peak netload by 18.5 %, and saved the total cost by 3.35 %, even after accounting for V2G enrollment compensation and battery degradation. EVs that charged during the daytime and participated in V2G at night were the most utilized, resulting in 0.92 % of annual battery aging, but generated a profit of 636,749 KRW (553 USD). The findings of this study underscore the importance of a suitable compensation scheme for V2G and supplementary measures for incentivizing EV charging during off-peak hours, as these elements are essential for the successful implementation of V2G.}

Thousands of EV constraints are consolidated through a polytope-based approach, and reinforcement costs are captured using a piece-wise linear model tailored to feeder capacity increments. Application to the Tuwaiq Smart City network, covering 3780 households, employs one-minute resolution data for 2024 to benchmark five operational schemes: No Flexibility, Demand Response, Smart Charging, Vehicle-to-Grid, and Integrated Decentralised Energy Management (IDEM). Compared with the baseline, IDEM achieves a 43.8 % reduction in annualised system cost, 46 % decrease in peak imports, and capacity cuts of 75 % and 82 % for PV and storage respectively, alongside a 65 % drop in grid integration expenses. A Monte Carlo test of 150 runs confirms cost stability within ±6 %, validating the robustness of layered flexibility under stochastic solar and mobility profiles.

The present paper develops an integrated approach to economically assess initiatives that can transform island power systems into smart ones. Single and multi-action initiatives fostering the deployment of renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESS), demand-side management (DSM), and electric vehicle (EV) are considered. An hourly unit commitment on a weekly basis is proposed to assess the impact of the initiatives on the system operation costs of five prototype island power systems, which have been identified by applying clustering techniques to a set of sixty islands power systems. The different investment costs of the initiatives are accounted for determining their corresponding internal rate of return (IRR) through their lifetime. The economic assessment of single and multi-action initiatives for five prototype islands representing sixty island power systems quantifies which initiatives are most suitable for which type of island power system. The assessment shows that islands of different sizes and features require different initiatives. Larger islands tend to DSM initiatives, whereas smaller islands tend to RES initiatives. Multi-action initiatives achieve highest system operation cost reduction, whereas single action initiatives yield to highest IRR.}

Therefore, effective interaction between EVs and the grid has become increasingly important, which is influenced by both variable renewable energy (VRE) on the supply side and charging strategies on the demand side. However, the impact of charging strategies on VRE capacity remains unclear. This study projects the charging loads of EVs under varying electrification levels and develops a city-scale power system dispatch optimization model that incorporates charging strategies to assess their technical, economic, and environmental impacts on the power system. Using Beijing as a case study, the results show that electrification levels significantly influence the effectiveness of charging strategies on power system operation and planning. Compared with uncoordinated charging, unidirectional (V1G) and bidirectional (V2G) charging reduce carbon emissions by up to 1 % and 41 % and total system costs by 7 % and 13 %, respectively, under high electrification. They also provide additional system flexibility, enabling a significant increase in the installed capacity of VRE and its share in the power mix, with V2G performing better and further outperforming V1G in grid stability and peak shaving capacity. Therefore, EV charging with V2G should be incorporated into VRE capacity planning to realize its full potential.}

As smart grids increasingly incorporate decentralized prosumers, innovative coordination strategies are essential to fully exploit their potential and improve system self-healing capabilities. To address this need, this paper presents a novel bi-level strategy for managing the self-healing process within a smart grid influenced by Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRSs), Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs), and energy hubs. This approach taps into the combined potential of these prosumers to boost system self-healing speed and reliability. In the initial stage, the Smart Grid Operator (SGO) conducts self-healing planning during emergencies, communicating required nodal capacities to prevent forced load shedding and outlining incentives for smart prosumers. Subsequently, prosumers schedule their activities and contribute flexible capacities to the SGO. Bridging the first and second stages, an adaptive Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm ensures convergence between the SGO and prosumer schedules within a decentralized framework. This strategy underwent implementation on a 118-node distribution system using GAMS. Results demonstrate that the proposed concept reduces Forced Load Shedding (FLS) by 32.04% and self-healing costs by 17.48% through effective utilization of smart prosumers' flexible capacities. Furthermore, outcomes indicate that the SGO reduces FLS by 6.69% by deploying Mobile Electrical Energy Storages (MEESs) and Mobile Fuel Cell Trucks (MFCTs) to critical nodes.}

Optimized station layout and charging schedule could coordinate the load curve, provide system flexibility and accommodate the variable renewables. However, previous work only focuses on maximizing the profit of station holders and vehicle owners, lacking the consideration of the broader impact on power system. Here, we propose an EV charging station layout optimization methodology considering not only the EV charging behavior, sequential charging demand, but also its further impact on power system. The station layout and charging schedule are co-optimized with an integrated power system model. Applying the proposed methodology to Jiangxi in 2025, a cumulative charging station capacity of 1412, 1092, and 1415 MW is recommended in workplaces, residences, and shopping centers, respectively. Increased renewable energy integration and decreased thermal power generation are realized, achieving reduced carbon emissions of 800 kilotons. This work provides an effective methodology for slow charging station layout from the perspective of the integrated power system.}

For PEVs, this paradigm shift requires attention to the impact of home charging on the grid in an era where distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar panels and batteries, are being commercially deployed. To understand the integration of light-duty PEVs with residential DERs, a model is developed to simulate PEV charging demand profiles in combination with field data from three different home groups of varying DER configurations. A valley-filling smart charging algorithm is explored to optimize vehicle charging, more effectively utilize solar PV, reduce emissions, and reduce peak demand. The results show that (1) the impact on transformer hot spot temperature and loss of life is acceptable for all cases, (2) smart charging can increase transformer life, (3) while PEV deployment reduces GHG emissions, additional reduction can be achieved through the integration of DERs and smart charging, and (4) the addition of DERs and implementation of smart charging virtually eliminate the negative impacts of PEVs on distribution grid infrastructure, increases PV penetration, and reduces emissions and peak demand.}

To reveal the long-term cost and environmental impacts of V2G, a novel power system planning model is established by co-optimizing the power system investment and operational decisions with V2G. Two V2G modes are discussed in this study: 1) the unidirectional V2G functions as a flexible load; and 2) the bidirectional V2G serves as an alternative energy storage option. The case study in China demonstrates that V2G can effectively mitigate the transition cost in the power system and bring about considerable environmental benefits. The transition cost of the power system will decrease by 2.0 % ∼ 3.8 % and the annualized carbon emissions will be reduced by 8.7–26.9 million tons due to V2G integrations during the period of 2021–2060. The cost and environmental impacts mainly arise from altering the generation and capacity mix of the power system. It is found that V2G can improve the utilization rate of existing units, thereby reducing the required capacity of coal-fired power units. Also, V2G can enhance the system flexibility which is most beneficial to solar power integration. To fully realize the intended benefits of V2G, policy guidance holds a pivotal role. Policy recommendations aimed at guiding the V2G practice and enhancing its environmental benefits are offered based on the findings of this study.}

Considering uncertainties, which are associated with solar irradiance and wind speed, can increase the ability to achieve proper energy management. In addition to that, considering the smart grid's role in the electricity market as a price maker and the unpredictable behavior of EVs, these considerations aim to minimize costs and maximize profits for microgrids. The main contribution of this paper is studying the impact of increasing the charging tariff of EVs in the presence of different types of RERs on charging behavior, maximizing the profit of the microgrid, and reducing the total energy purchased from the wholesale market. For this purpose, a metaheuristic-based optimization problem called Gorilla Troops optimizer (GTO) is employed to optimally allocate the RERs and the EV charging stations. The results demonstrate that increasing the charging tariff without RERs or with only one source of RERs results in the charging of EVs following an uncontrollable strategy. Hence, the cost of purchasing energy from the utility increases. On the other hand, compared to the base case, integrating EV charging stations with multi- type RERs resulted in the profit increasing by 61.92 % and the total energy purchased from the wholesale market decreasing by 24.98 %. Moreover, the waiting time at the charging station will be reduced shortly; the annual installment of multi- type RERs decreased by 31.25 % compared with considering only one source of RERs, and the charging strategy of EVs followed the controllable charging strategy.}

The current research mainly focuses on single facility planning or simple optimization models, which are difficult to solve the complex interaction problems between spatiotemporal charging dynamics, user service demands, and grid constraints. To this end, this study proposes an innovative framework for collaborative planning of charging and swapping facilities. Firstly, Monte Carlo simulation of spatiotemporal load distribution is used to coordinate the allocation of charging and swapping facility resources, breaking through the limitations of traditional isolated planning. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed, using a weighted sum strategy to coordinate construction costs, user waiting time, and grid stability indicators, achieving dynamic balance of conflicting objectives. Furthermore, the Improved Hummingbird Algorithm (IAHA) is developed, which integrates chaotic mapping to enhance population diversity, and combines non-uniform mutation to achieve adaptive global local search, effectively solving high-dimensional complex programming problems. A case study in a certain region of northern China shows that compared to particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, this framework can reduce annual infrastructure costs by 62.3 million yuan, improve convergence speed by 40%, and significantly improve the load balancing characteristics of the power grid. This study provides a solid theoretical foundation and practical solutions for optimizing charging infrastructure, which has important guiding significance for the flexible operation of smart grids and the improvement of user service quality.}

Furthermore, while existing modelling studies have demonstrated EVs as effective tools for electricity balancing and delivery between locations, their potential remains unexplored empirically. This study aims to bridge the research gap by studying EV charging behaviours and their capacity for electricity balancing and delivery. Using data from 179,665 real-world charging sessions in Sweden, we employed statistical and clustering analysis to scrutinize charging behaviours comprehensively. Synthetic weekly charging load profiles are generated for both residential areas and workplaces, considering varying charging power levels, which can be used as inputs for large-scale EV charging load modelling. Furthermore, performance indicators are proposed to quantify the potential of EVs for electricity balancing and delivery. Results show that EVs exhibit significant potential for electricity balancing (up to 51.5 kWh daily). Many EV owners underutilize their EV battery capacity, providing an opportunity for active electricity delivery across locations.

A novel variable pricing strategy for slow charging is also proposed to decrease the operator’s expenses while promoting this mode of charging. The proposed methodology is validated through the integration of a 33-bus distribution test system with a 25-node traffic system. The analysis was conducted using three multi-objective optimization methods: Multi-Objective Cuckoo Search, Multi-Objective Flower Pollination Algorithm, and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. From the results, it is possible to conclude that the proposed approach provides benefits not only to the system operator but also to EV users, given the reduction in their travel costs. Despite the increased charging demand, the optimization results show a reduction in voltage deviation by 11.57%–16.94% and power losses by 19.71%–24.20% compared to the original system.}

abstract = {The high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) poses both opportunities and challenges for power systems. EV retailers, playing a critical role in the demand response mechanism, face market risks caused by uncertainties in electricity consumption and prices. To address the operational issues of large-scale EVs and tap the potential of EV retailers, a temporal and spatial domain-based optimization strategy is proposed, which is implemented on bi-level (referring to transmission and distribution grid networks). First, a physical scheduling model of the grid is established, consisting of a novel hybrid demand response mechanism considering the incentives of EV retailers and the retail electricity price of EV users, and a new robust retail electricity pricing strategy handling the uncertainties of EV behavior and the electric market. Then, a bi-level optimization strategy is presented: at the upper level, in the transmission network, based on the robust pricing strategy, a unit commitment model that coordinates the hybrid demand response with other distributed energy resources is designed to optimize load periods of EVs in the time domain; at the lower level, in the distribution network, an optimal power flow model is proposed to spatially dispatch the location of EV loads. The impacts of retail price profile, EV penetration, hybrid demand response mechanism, and EV load location are analyzed in ten tests using the IEEE 33 distribution network. Simulation results indicate that the robust pricing strategy can effectively handle uncertainties, the integration of the hybrid demand response mechanism into scheduling can ensure the benefits of all participants, and the bi-level optimization strategy can accommodate distributed energy resources temporally and spatially.}

The results support the conclusion that network reinforcement deferral is not a panacea, as it often generates costly situations in the long-term.

On the one hand, demand response and electric vehicles have the feasibility to change the load demand curve to solve the mismatch problem. On the other hand, they can serve as reserve for wind power. To deal with the unit commitment problem, authors use a fuzzy chance-constrained program that takes into account the wind power forecasting errors. The numerical study shows that the model can promote the utilization of wind power evidently, making the power system operation more eco-friendly and economical.}

This study proposes a smart and integrated framework designed to enhance system resilience by leveraging coordinated multi-energy microgrids (MGs) and distributed energy resources (DERs). The proposed framework introduces four key components: (1) a spatiotemporal resilience assessment approach incorporating robustness, survivability, and recoverability indices; (2) a hierarchical control architecture for MG coordination; (3) a hybrid stochastic–robust optimization model to balance operational efficiency and resilience objectives; and (4) data-driven, self-learning decision-making mechanisms enabled by real-time analytics. The framework is implemented on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system with integrated electrical, thermal, and gas subsystems. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a 60% reduction in outage duration, 95% retention of critical loads during contingencies, and a 52.5% reduction in CO2 emissions per event. Notable innovations include the integration of bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) support, dynamic DER dispatch, and multi-domain resilience metrics. Despite resilience gains, trade-offs were observed—most notably, an active power loss of 8613.89 kW associated with a resilience index of –35.61—underscoring the need for adaptive weight tuning in multi-objective optimization. Overall, this work bridges theoretical concepts of resilience with practical implementation strategies, offering actionable insights for utility operators in both planning and real-time response contexts.}

To address these challenges, we propose a new authentication protocol based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that enables secure communication between EVs and charging stations in V2G networks. The proposed plan functions by going through four primary phases, which are: 1) Initialization, 2) Registration, 3) Authentication and 4) password change, vehicle revoke and new joining. Our protocol aims to maintain secure connections while minimizing computation and communication costs through the use of lightweight cryptographic operations such as one-way hash functions, concatenation, and bitwise Xor operations. We validated the security of our protocol through both informal and formal security analyses, including verification with the Scyther Verification tool, which confirms that the proposed protocol is free from security threats within bounds. Our ECC-based authentication protocol for V2G is more secure and lightweight compared to other related protocols in the same context. Our contributions are: 1) A new ECC-based authentication framework for energy Internet (EI)-based V2G communication systems, and 2) The use of lightweight cryptographic operations to reduce computational expenditure and improve resource utilization.

On the other hand, Microgrids mostly use Renewable Energy Systems (RES) in electrical power production that are naturally fluctuating, in a time there are increasing trends to install the controllable loads such as Heat Pumps (HPs) and V2Gs. On the other hand, operating manners and uncertainties in power systems cause the classic controllers to be unable to provide a proper performance over a wide range of operating conditions. In order to overcome such issues, this paper addresses a control scheme approach using Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) technique to enhance the system validity and robustness against uncertainties. The proposed scheme suggests a parallel connection of CDM and PI controllers in which the performance has been compared with only conventional controller showing that the proposed scheme has superior validity. Different operation schemes have been simulated showing the flexibility of V2G utilization in the modern power system.}

In this study, a nonlinear mathematical model is developed to explore effective strategies for smart grids. A general regression learner-based battery cycling ageing prediction method is proposed for quantifications of lifetime battery cycling ageing and battery replacement times, including the database preparation, surrogate model training with typical feature extraction and classification, cross-validation, and performance prediction in various battery groups. A machine learning (ML) algorithm selection approach is proposed through the statistical analysis, to guide the accurate surrogate model development, considering the diversity in dynamic charging/discharging behaviours and intrinsic cycling ageing performances of each battery. Afterwards, a novel battery discharging control strategy is proposed, to address the contradiction between the economic cost-saving and the associated battery replacement cost. Last but not the least, the machine learning-based models are thereafter integrated in the district energy community for technical performance analysis. This study can provide a regression learner-based battery cycling ageing modelling method, a machine learning algorithm selection approach, and a holistic framework for systematic integration with avoidance on techno-economic performance overestimation, which is critical to guide renewable energy planning, electrochemical battery storages, and advanced energy management strategies.}

abstract = {The unit commitment (UC) problem is a typical mixed integer nonlinear programming problem related to power systems. As electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs; e.g., wind and solar power) have become integrated into the power system, the UC problem has become increasingly complex. With the continuous growth of the proportion of renewable energy based on wind and solar energy in the power supply structure on the supply side in the future, the random characteristics of the supply and demand sides of the power system will become more obvious, which will inevitably bring about the safety, stability and economic operation of the power system. The study of UC not only has great academic value, but also has important practical significance. The optimal scheduling of UC, including thermal, wind, solar, and EV power units was investigated. The objective function of optimal scheduling was to minimize the operating cost of the unit and optimize the charging and discharging costs of EVs. In view of power generation characteristics of RESs, an interval number was introduced to describe the uncertainties in the outputs of wind and solar power generation. The enhanced-interval linear programming is introduced to deal with the UC problem including EVs and uncertainty of RES. For better accuracy, wind power was considered for each of the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) and solar power was divided into sunny, cloudy, and rainy conditions. To reflect the influence of EV charging and discharging on UC, three different charging and discharging pricing schemes were considered. Various scenarios were simulated using the CPLEX solver. The results showed that costs can be affected by season and climate. The interval number solution sets of the total cost and of the charging and unit costs were obtained by using interval number theory to describe the uncertainty of output in RESs; this provides a new approach for solving the UC optimization problem by integrating RESs. The charging and discharging of EVs can also affect costs. By encouraging the orderly charging and discharging of EVs, power load fluctuations could be reduced and peak-load shifting could be achieved. Different pricing schemes had different impacts on cost. The pricing scheme can not only effectively reduce the charging cost borne by EV owners, but could also make EVs profitable. This discovery provides a theoretical basis for guidance on the charging and discharging of EVs through charge and discharge price schemes. The simulation results reflect the relationship between economic cost and seasons/climate and confirm the suitability of using an interval number to describe uncertainty in energy generation.}

abstract = {The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) presents significant challenges for electricity grid management, particularly in accurately identifying EV charging patterns to optimize distribution network planning. Most recent works focus on EV load forecasting for future grid planning and do not take into account real-time EV charging identification. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised memory-based transformer (M-TR) model for real-time detection of EV charging events from streaming smart meter data. The proposed method is designed for deployment by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) and can be integrated into smart grid management systems to enhance grid stability and demand response strategies. The M-TR model leverages an encoder-decoder architecture: the encoder captures coarse-scale historical patterns over an extended temporal window, while the decoder focuses on fine-scale details within a local window. A key innovation of this approach is the dual memory comparison mechanism, which enables faster real-time inference by dynamically integrating historical and recent data. Unlike existing methods, the M-TR requires no prior knowledge of EV charging profiles and only uses real power consumption data from non-EV users. The goal of this approach is to automatically identify EV charging events from behind the meter aggregated smart meter data without requiring labeled EV data or additional sensors, thereby enabling real-time monitoring, reducing grid uncertainties, and supporting load balancing strategies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art unsupervised models, the M-TR achieves superior performance with an average F-score of 0.844 and an AUC of 0.910, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the model’s efficient execution time of 1.2 s per 1-min data sample highlights its suitability for real-time applications. This work underscores the importance of incorporating global temporal context and dual memory mechanisms in EV charging detection, offering a scalable solution for integrating EVs into the power grid.}

Previous research has established useful modeling approaches. However, limitations to expressing macro and local characteristics simultaneously remain. To address this deficiency, this study developed a data-driven workflow to extract vehicle usage profiles from human mobility big data collected from mobile devices to quantify vehicle usage, EV charging demand, and flexibility on a large scale at a high spatiotemporal resolution. The application to entire Japan showed that if all the private vehicles are electric, uncontrolled home charging would reach a maximum of 25 GW. EVs have significant flexibility potential through smart charging and vehicle-to-grid operations. The 1 km-mesh-resolution data showed that activity patterns, demand, and flexibility vary considerably depending on the accessibility to public transportation. The established method can provide high spatiotemporal resolution EV data for various purposes and also allows for iterative studies that integrate local and macro-level power systems.}

Several parameters are taken into account as part of this process, such as proximity to load centers, capacity of the power system, and traffic volume. The common charging station location distant from the load centers has been established to enhance the quality of power and reduce 5–10 % of distribution losses. Additionally, site location should also include the area land cost and this cost in the urban area is estimated to be about $500 to $2000 per square meter and other zoning regulations. In the design, the service radius of charging stations is also an important factor; Keeping the battery's DOD between 50 % and 70 % yields an estimated driving range of 150–200 km, which suggests a distance between stations of 50–70 km. In this case, the discount rate of 5 % can be adopted for O&M costs over the planning horizon of 20 years while the capital costs of provision of each station varies from $ 50,000 to $ 200,000 depending on the size of the station. The establishment of a large network for charging the EVs will enhance the power balance of the system thus reducing power losses whilst increasing the penetration of electric vehicles by integrating these numerical aspects together with technology and environmental considerations.}

Despite the potential of EV loads offering emergency demand response (DR) for addressing such challenges, the willingness of EVs to respond to DR and the actual response quantity are uncertain. Furthermore, the uncertainty level in EV response varies along with DR incentive decisions, which further aggravates operation challenges. This paper proposes a resilient unit commitment (UC) model for EV-integrated power systems against extreme cold events. Specifically, first, we model how the temperature-sensitive EV charging loads change under extreme cold events considering the actual driving range and air conditioning load in EVs. Then, the inter-coupling relationship between uncertainties in EV response quantity and the DR incentive decisions is modeled. To overcome the limitations of conventional modeling approaches for decision-independent uncertainty, an affine function-based tractable model reformulation is presented addressing decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) in EV response. Subsequently, we establish the resilient UC model within a two-stage stochastic framework considering temperature-sensitive EV loads and DDU in EVs’ response behaviors. Case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed UC model in cost-efficiently and reliably accommodating increased EV loads under extreme cold events.}

It is in the interest of utility providers and everyday consumers to be able to plan for peak charging times, and related congestion. While past work has been done for localized, short-term forecasting, it has not included longer term forecasting, or considered the relationships between multiple stations. Importantly, past work has also not offered a framework for dataset construction and evaluated different dataset features. We propose a methodology to forecast demand at public EV charging stations, and use it to explore the potential of data-driven models to predict demand up to one week in advance. Our strategy includes selecting parameters for formatting a dataset given a list of charging events, a way to consider flexible prediction horizons, and deployment of deep and supervised learning-based models. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to propose machine learning to forecast medium-term public EV charging demand, to exploit weather and other features at public charging stations, and to forecast demand at multiple stations and the entire network. We validated our approach using data from eleven stations over three years from Scotland, UK. Our method outperforms the benchmark time series method, and predicts network demand with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 5.9% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 124.7 kWh, or less than twelve percent of average daily demand.}

abstract = {Decreasing initial costs, the increased availability of charging infrastructure and favorable policy measures have resulted in the recent surge in plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) ownerships. PEV adoption increases electricity consumption from the grid that could either exacerbate electricity supply shortages or smooth demand curves. The optimal coordination and commitment of power generation units while ensuring wider access of PEVs to the grid are, therefore, important to reduce the cost and environmental pollution from thermal power generation systems, and to transition to a smarter grid. However, flexible demand side management (DSM) considering the stochastic charging behavior of PEVs adds new challenges to the complex power system optimization, and makes existing mathematical approaches ineffective. In this research, a novel parallel competitive swarm optimization algorithm is developed for solving large-scale unit commitment (UC) problems with mixed-integer variables and multiple constraints – typically found in PEV integrated grids. The parallel optimization framework combines binary and real-valued competitive swarm optimizers for solving the UC problem and demand side management of PEVs simultaneously. Numerical case studies have been conducted with multiple scales of unit numbers and various demand side management strategies of plug-in electric vehicles. The results show superior performance of proposed parallel competitive swarm optimization based method in successfully solving the proposed complex optimization problem. The flexible demand side management strategies of plug-in electric vehicles have shown large potentials in bringing considerable economic benefit.}

However, while the most focus is on optimization algorithms and multi-objective techniques, little to no attention is paid to the underlying mechanisms in planning frameworks. This paper goes beyond existing literature by investigating the impact of planning mechanisms in smart grid planning frameworks when considering the allocation of PV distributed generation units, battery energy storage systems, capacitor banks, and electric vehicle charging station facilities. First, a single- and multi-objective planning problem is formulated. Then, we propose a novel adaptive-dynamic planning mechanism that uses a recombination technique to find optimal allocation variables of multiple DER and FACTS types. To cope with the additional complexity resulting from the expanded solution space, we develop a hybrid stochastic optimizer, named cooperative spiral genetic algorithm with differential evolution (CoSGADE) optimization scheme, to produce optimal allocation solution variables. Through numerical simulations, it is seen that the proposed adaptive planning mechanism improves achieves a 12% and 14% improvement to the conventional sequential (multi-stage) and simultaneous mechanisms, on small to large scale distribution networks.}

Distribution network operators (DNO) are investing in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to enable cost reduction through smart grid applications. The DNO also benefits from the additional measurement data the AMI gives for the network planning process. The availability of AMI data can be limited by the cost of communication and by privacy concerns. To determine the social welfare of an AMI, the economic gains should be estimated. For the planning of the low voltage (LV) network, a method for determining the value of an AMI still needs to be developed. Therefore, a planning methodology which allows various levels of measurement data availability has been developed. By applying this approach the value of different levels of AMI from an LV-network planning perspective can be determined. To illustrated the application of this approach a case study for the LV-network of a Dutch DNO is performed. The results show that an increase in measurement data can lead to €49-254 lower LV-network reinforcement costs. A detailed analysis of the results shows that already 50% of the possible cost reduction can be achieved if only 65% of the households have AMI data available.}

A multi-criteria optimization problem is formulated with model predictive control (MPC) for five cases of demand flexibility. The simulation results of five winter days show that the peak power during the peak periods can be reduced by 92%, 69%, 100%, and 100% for real-time pricing, demand limiting, load shedding, and load shifting, respectively.

The main objective is to minimize the hourly power system operation cost with a cleaner, socially responsible, and sustainable generation of electricity. Emission constraints are enforced to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional thermal generating units. The stationary electric vehicles (EV) are considered as an example of distributed storage and vehicle to grid (V2G) technology is considered to demonstrate the bilateral role of EV as supplier and consumer of energy. Battery storage can ease the impact of variability of renewable energy sources on power system operations and reduce the impact of thermal generation emission at peak hours. We model the day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems as a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem for solving the hourly security-constraint unit commitment (SCUC). In order to expedite the real-time solution for large-scale power systems, we consider a two-stage model of the hourly SCUC by applying the Benders decomposition (BD). The Benders decomposition would separate the hourly generation unit commitment (UC) in the master problem from the power network security check in subproblem. The subproblem would check dc network security constraints for the given UC solution to determine whether a converged and secure dc power flow can be obtained. If any power network violations arise, corresponding Benders cuts are formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will continue until the network violations are eliminated and a converged hourly solution is found for scheduling the power generating units. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MILP approach and its potentials as an optimization tool for sustainable operations of electric power grids.}

Mitigating these impacts requires optimal planning that accounts for RES variability and additional EV charging demand. This paper presents a novel approach for the simultaneous optimal allocation and sizing of RES and EV charging stations, along with coordinated management of the charging process. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and supply costs, and EV battery costs. The model incorporates coefficients based on wind speed, solar radiation, and hourly peak demand to manage EV charging during off-peak hours. A hybrid Harris Hawk Optimization–Sine Cosine Algorithm (HHO-SCA) is proposed to develop a meta-heuristic-based RES and EVs charging system. By integrating SCA features into HHO, the algorithm enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities, thereby improving global search efficiency and optimizing energy usage. The performance of HHO-SCA has been validated on benchmark functions. The HHO-SCA is employed to solve the proposed optimization problem across five scenarios. Its effectiveness for simultaneous optimal siting and sizing of RES and EV charging stations is validated on the IEEE 33 and 69 bus system. Results indicate that HHO-SCA outperforms other methods by effectively avoiding local optima and exhibiting superior convergence behavior.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has resulted in considerable indirect carbon emissions from power systems. To reduce charging emissions, EVs should be charged strategically to consume generated renewable energy electricity. To achieve this goal, a low-carbon demand response model is proposed to stimulate multi-type EV users to consume more low-carbon electricity by guiding users to adjust their charging behaviour temporally and spatially. First, the charging flexibility of EVs is modelled considering different user behaviours and charging modes. To accurately guide the EV demand response, a method is proposed to calculate future carbon emission factors with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Considering the carbon emission factors, charging flexibility is integrated into a model for a low-carbon demand response. This model holistically optimizes fast and slow charging of EVs from the user’s perspective. Case studies are carried out using real-world data and future planning results for Changzhou and China. The results indicate that EVs produce 73 % less carbon emissions during driving than traditional gasoline vehicles. Using low-carbon demand response to guide EV charging could reduce carbon emissions by up to 15 % by 2035.}

However, these non-dispatchable renewable technologies pose operational challenges for power systems, creating the need for increased storage solutions and effective demand-side management. In this context, leveraging the flexibility inherent in these emerging demand resources—such as electrolysers and EVs—is crucial for addressing the anticipated rise in electricity demand. This study evaluates the effects of flexible operation of electrolysers and smart charging of electric vehicles on renewable energy curtailment, backup capacity, energy storage systems, and dispatchable generation within the Portuguese power system, focusing on the 2030 horizon as outlined in the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP 2030). Simulations conducted using the SWHORD simulator indicate that the flexible operation of electrolysers and EV charging significantly alleviates the pressure on energy storage systems, including pumped hydro storage and battery energy storage (BESS). Additionally, it eliminates the necessity for backup capacity and reduces reliance on natural gas power generation, leading to decreased generation costs and lower CO2 emissions.}

Unlike conventional two-stage robust optimization methods, our approach incorporates a resilience-driven formulation that explicitly accounts for severe renewable generation fluctuations, sudden demand variations, and unforeseen grid disturbances. The proposed model leverages a mixed-integer programming formulation, solved using a decomposition algorithm, to ensure computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The method optimally coordinates charging and discharging strategies for storage systems and electric vehicles, alongside flexible demand management, to minimize operational costs, startup/shutdown and no-load expenses, unserved load costs, and emissions. Simulations conducted on multiple test networks (6-bus, 24-bus, 118-node, and 300-node systems) validate the effectiveness of the approach. The results demonstrate optimal objective function values of $608,976 for the 6-bus network, $3399,185 for the 24-bus network, $21.58 million for the 118-node network, and $62.41 million for the 300-node network.

Conventional fixed charging stations (FCS) lack flexibility, failing to adapt to the spatiotemporally dynamic and heterogeneous nature of EV charging demand, thereby exacerbating grid resilience risks. To address this, we propose a dual-mode multi-agent mobile robot-based adaptive charging network (MRACN) that enhances power system resilience through real-time, intelligent coordination of mobile charging resources. Our dynamic scheduling strategy enables MRACN units to switch seamlessly between cost-optimized dispatch during normal operations and resilience-driven prioritization during emergencies, guided by a real-time voltage stability index (VSI)-derived resilience coefficient. The framework combines a power-traffic co-simulation environment modelling urban congestion, heterogeneous EV mobility (private, taxi, fleet), and spatiotemporal demand variations, and a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model optimizing energy cost, customer satisfaction, and voltage stability under realistic constraints (traffic delays, mobility restrictions, grid safety margins). Simulations on a coupled IEEE 33-bus distribution system and 32-node transportation network demonstrate MRACN's superiority in enhancing voltage resilience, reducing operational costs, and improving EV service reliability across both normal and extreme grid scenarios. The results validate MRACN as a scalable, adaptive solution for resilient smart grids in EV-dominated environments.}

This involves addressing a constrained multi-objective optimization problem that includes integer decision parameters. Two deficiencies exist in current methods for scheduling domestic device operation. Firstly, user satisfaction is often overlooked, and secondly, there is a lack of an effective global optimization algorithm to solve the problem. In this study, the optimization of domestic appliance planning in the HEM system is conceptualized as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, employing the Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA). Ten different case studies are conducted to determine the optimal planning of devices based on various demand response programs. Two smart houses, each with 10 and 11 devices, including electric vehicles as significant domestic loads, are considered. To accurately estimate the total load demand, a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed for predicting smart building load demand. The system's validity and model performance are assessed by applying results to the digital twin of the smart building and later to the real test system. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional algorithms such as WOA, PSO, DEA, and dragonfly algorithms.

Buildings and electric transport systems, especially subway systems and Plug in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), are among the major energy consumption systems in a smart city. In this paper, a linear model is proposed for the co-optimization planning and operation of distributed energy resources and transportation systems in an interconnected system that analyzes the interactions of such an interconnected system. The idea of Regenerative Breaking Energy (RBE) is deployed to improve the operation of the subway system through the interconnected subway system in the smart city.

In this paper, the traffic and length of the routes are modeled considering Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to Subway (V2S) located in the parking lots. Furthermore, the degradation model is developed to increase the PEVs’ battery life. An unscented transformation (UT) approach is utilized to construct a stochastic framework based on the uncertainty method, to handle the uncertain behaviors of PEVs and distributed energy resource and loads in the smart city.

abstract = {The sudden surge in electric vehicle (EV) adoption has significantly increased electricity demand, posing new challenges for radial distribution networks (RDNs). The large-scale deployment of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) introduces operational issues such as elevated power losses, voltage instability, and line overloading, thereby testing the grid's robustness and efficiency. To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel optimization framework that integrates the quasi-refined slime mould algorithm (QRSMA) with conventional slime mould algorithm (SMA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques for the optimal placement of solar-based distributed generators (SDGs) and shunt capacitors (SCs). The proposed method aims to minimize a multi-objective function incorporating real and reactive power losses, voltage deviation, and voltage stability, thereby enhancing the stability and reliability of RDN operations. The framework employs stochastic modeling based on four years of hourly meteorological data to account for uncertainties in solar irradiance and temperature. Additionally, the EVCS model includes dynamic operational aspects such as mean queue lengths, waiting times, and demand response (DR) load control. The methodology is validated using both a practical Indian 28-bus RDN and the large-scale IEEE 118-bus system to assess scalability and generalizability. Simulation results confirm the superior performance of QRSMA in improving voltage profiles, reducing power losses, and achieving better computational efficiency compared to conventional optimization algorithms. Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the robustness of QRSMA under varying objective priorities. Moreover, the economic assessment using the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) indicates strong financial viability for real-world implementation. This work underscores the importance of coordinated planning of SDGs and SCs to mitigate EVCS-induced challenges and provides a scalable, efficient solution for modern, EV-integrated smart grids.}

abstract = {In the approaching years, the utilization of Distributed Generations (DGs) with Electric Vehicles (EVs) will accelerate. Future issues will be exacerbated by the relationship between the distribution system of DGs solely, DGs with Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), and DGs with Extended Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (Ex-PHEV). This paper discusses the use of a multi-tasking Genetic Algorithm to optimize DGs with EVs planning in distribution systems for load models for rating and placement determination. From a system perspective, the goal of this research is to reduce total real power loss. The various types of DGs with EVs are taken into account from the standpoint of the analysis. Photovoltaic, diesel engines, synchronous condensers, and doubly-fed induction generators are examples of various types of DGs. In this analysis, EV types such as FCEV and Ex-PHEV are considered. Different forms of constant impedance (Z), constant current (I), and constant power (P) load models are included in DGs with EVs planning for improving system performance indices, such as Light-emitting diode, Laptop charger, Personal computer, Tungsten light, and Vacuum tube. The real power loss index (%ILP), the reactive power loss index (%ILQ), the voltage deviation index (%IVD), the short circuit current reduction (%IC), the active power DGs with EVs penetration (% PPWDGs & EVs), and the reactive power DGs with EVs penetration (%PQWDGs & EVs) are all measured in this paper. On the 37-bus test distribution system, the effectiveness of the listed approach was verified.This article is very much useful for researchers, industrial, scientific persons, and those who are working in the smart grid with DGs and EVs.}

To enhance the electric vehicle charging capacity of community power grids, this paper proposes a two-tier capacity allocation strategy for community microgrids in the context of power systems. The upper-level model allocates capacity with the objectives of highest MG reliability, minimum comprehensive operating cost and minimum carbon emission, while the lower-level model optimizes the scheduling strategy with the objectives of minimum weighted operating cost and minimum charging cost for EV users. First, the real-time price is used to guide the residents’ electricity consumption behavior to be more adaptive to the uncertainty of renewable energy sources and to ensure that the community MG has sufficient resilient capacity. Second, based on the alternative storage effect of EVs, EVs are integrated with storage batteries and participate in ancillary services. The results indicate that adopting the charging and discharging strategy can reduce the comprehensive operating cost by ¥3,673.575 while improving reliability by 1.925%. Although the carbon trading market increases the overall operating cost, it results in an additional 131.5 kW of renewable energy capacity. Furthermore, the microgrid’s participation in the ancillary service market can reduce costs by ¥7,992.9. Furthermore, a comparison of the GSA-MVO results with those of MVO and SSA demonstrates the superiority of the proposed optimization algorithm in terms of convergence to the optimal solution.}

The goal is to address stability issues in the power system that arise from large-scale EV charging, as well as to overcome the limitations found in existing studies related to the dynamic interplay between the traffic-grid system and uncertainties in user behavior. A dynamic road model that couples time, speed, and flow is initially established, which integrates the road network with the power grid systems. This model ensures the accurate assignment of vehicle origin-destination (OD) pairs and optimizes path planning using an enhanced Dijkstra algorithm. Thereafter, energy consumption per mile is modeled by incorporating factors such as ambient temperature and driving speed. Subsequently, the Huff-Long Short-Term Memory (Huff-LSTM) model is introduced to characterize user behavior in selecting a charging station. This innovative approach combines the LSTM neural network with the Huff model, accommodating multi-dimensional constraints such as charging station availability and queuing time. The comparison of multiple schemes using real charging station data in Shenzhen demonstrates that the coefficient of determination for this decision model is 0.8912. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation, in conjunction with co-simulation using the IEEE 33-node distribution network, demonstrates that the proposed model effectively captures the spatial and temporal divergence characteristics of temperature-sensitive charging behavior under typical scenarios, thereby enhancing the accuracy of EV charging load simulation.}

The electric vehicle and heat pump are considered as the controllable loads which can compensate the power for the forecast error of renewable energy sources. As a result, power generation cost of the smart grid can reduce through coordinated with distributed generations and thermal units scheduling process.

In addition to their positive environmental impact, electric vehicles can also serve as energy storage units, enabling a bidirectional energy flow between the vehicles and the grid. Despite these promising prospects, a disjointed approach to charging infrastructure planning overlooks the synergies between the energy and transportation ecosystem. This calls for a holistic and coordinated approach to infrastructure development that harnesses the benefits emerging from the convergence of electric vehicles, renewable energy, and transport planning. This paper presents a methodology for the optimal placement of future Energy Hubs for electric vehicle charging and renewable generation. The methodology uses data from open-source datasets involving renewable energy sources, traffic density, charging patterns, road topology, and land use. The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective linear programming problem, with the objectives of minimizing the number of Energy Hub units, minimizing electric vehicles charging radius coverage and distance from power substations, and maximizing energy generation. The methodology is demonstrated through an application in Trondheim, Norway, which produces a Pareto front for decision-makers to evaluate the best trade-offs between objectives.}

This study tackles the critical challenge of aligning investment and planning between these systems, specifically considering the impact of EV charging behaviors. To address this issue, we propose a novel tri-level optimization framework that incorporates a quasi-variational inequality (QVI) model to effectively capture the interactions between user equilibrium (UE) in transportation networks and elastic EV charging demand. The upper level of the model optimizes investments in power systems, including distributed generation and charging infrastructure. The middle level concentrates on expanding road capacity, while the lower level resolves the traffic flow patterns under user equilibrium with elastic charging behaviors (UE-ECB) using the QVI approach. By transforming the tri-level model into a bi-level optimization program with quasi-variational inequality (OP-QVI) formulation, we achieve computational tractability and provide efficient solutions. Results show that the elastic charging demand model outperforms the non-elastic assumption, reducing total costs by 22.2 %, with power system investments down by 19.1 % and transportation system investments down by 39.8 %. These findings demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, avoiding the overestimation of infrastructure needs. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm efficiently solves complex integrated planning problems, ensuring both computational effectiveness and economic viability in system-wide optimization.}

These tools shall combine short-term variability with long-term planning, while addressing multiple smart grid integration challenges. The present work proposes the evolution of an economic dispatch model to an integrated modelling tool, adding planning features. These consist in the implementation and sizing of different renewable and storage energy systems, and the development of demand scenarios, as the introduction of electric vehicles, demand response strategies, and/or residential efficiency measures. Levelized cost of electricity, operation costs, CO2 emissions and renewable shares are quantified. Terceira Island in Azores, is adopted as case study to validate the model. Results show that this tool has a great potential for supporting planning decisions, obtaining valuable parameters to analyze the proposed strategies, as the storage suitability, need of renewable curtailment or cost increase due to electric vehicles deployment.

In this article, the problem of planning the flexibility of electric vehicle charging and discharging to coordinate with wind and solar production and to compensate for the uncertainty of these resources has been solved using the CPLEX solver. Also, in this article, the flexibility of charging and discharging of electric vehicles has been used to coordinate with wind and solar production and compensate for the uncertainty of these sources. In addition, the EVs (Electric Vehicles) are planned in such a way that the operating cost of the microgrid is minimized. To consider the uncertainty related to loading, wind, and solar production, different scenarios have been considered and programming in R language has been done. These scenarios have been considered using the time series method of data determination and correlation. Due to the high number of scenarios and the increase in the volume of calculations, the scenario reduction method is used, then several scenarios with the highest probability of occurrence are selected and optimization is done. The simulation is done using GAMS software. The optimization problem is solved by integer linear programming. The results indicate that the cost is reduced by considering the uncertainties, through optimal planning for the EVs, and it is also profitable for the operator.}

To promote greener EV charging practices, this study proposes the environmental time-of-use (E-ToU) which provides time-varying prices and GHG intensity signals. Specifically, in E-ToU, GHG intensity is used as a nudge to steer drivers’ charging behavior, providing a mixed financial-environmental incentive. Conjoint-based choice experiments were conducted with participation of 1220 South Korean drivers (including 129 EV owners) to simulate EV charging under this novel scheme. Unit commitment was utilized to determine time-varying prices and GHG intensity, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of E-ToU. The results indicated that both charging costs and GHG intensity influenced the charging decisions (timing) of EV users. The E-ToU shifted EV charging to renewable-abundant daytime, reducing EV charging costs by 14.1 % and GHG emission from EV charging by 15.7 %. Additionally, it reduced the generation costs by 2.2 %, GHG emissions by 1.5 %, and renewable energy curtailments by 2.5 % in the power system. Notably, E-ToU outperformed flat-rate/ToU with respect to all evaluated metrics, highlighting its effectiveness. Therefore, this study recommends the mixed financial-environmental incentive approach for generating synergistic co-benefits for sustainability of power and transportation sectors.}

Some systems that can face the challenges of increasing population will help develop the smart city. Today, the relationship between various urban systems, such as transportation, communication and business networks, is very complicated. These complexities have greatly enhanced the importance of intelligent and quick coordination of cities with modern technologies. Internet of Things (IoT) one of the new technologies in the present era, and its application in cities can be considered as a major innovation for sustainable urban development. A smart city is a city that has the ability to effectively provide and present data in a meaningful way. On the other hand, today, with the expansion of the influence of Electric Vehicles (EV) in the transportation industry and the need for these EV to charge their battery, it is impossible to ignore the impact of these EV on the smart grid. In this thesis, the presence of EV in the context of urban and IoT is examined. As we use the intelligent city and the IoT, the historical data can be collected from the behavior of the owners of EV and the Deep learning method, one of the methods of machine learning; can be used to predict the level of charging of EV when entering the parking lot, EV location and parking lot connection periods. This will make us more successful in optimizing energy management, which is designed to minimize operational costs. The proposed model has been implemented on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization method for scheduling of distribution network in the presence of EV in the GAMS software environment. The results showed that the net profit is increased under the proposed plan.}

A smart grid achieves such aforementioned power supply by ensuring resilient energy delivery, which presents opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of power supply and minimize environmental impacts. A systematic evaluation of the comprehensive benefits brought by smart grid to smart cities can provide necessary theoretical fundamentals for urban planning and construction towards a sustainable energy future. However, most of the present methods of assessing smart cities do not fully take into account the benefits expected from the smart grid. To comprehensively evaluate the development levels of smart cities while revealing the supporting roles of smart grids, this article proposes a model of smart city development needs from the perspective of residents’ needs based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory, which serves the primary purpose of building a smart city. By classifying and reintegrating the needs, an evaluation index system of smart grids supporting smart cities was further constructed. A case analysis concluded that smart grids, as an essential foundation and objective requirement for smart cities, are important in promoting scientific urban management, intelligent infrastructure, refined public services, efficient energy utilization, and industrial development and modernization. Further optimization suggestions were given to the city analyzed in the case include strengthening urban management and infrastructure constructions, such as electric vehicle charging facilities and wireless coverage.}

However, their growth poses significant challenges to system operation, such as bidirectional power flow, intermittent power generation, increased peak demand, and unexpected frequency/voltage fluctuation. To tackle these challenges, we developed a vehicle-to-grid model, which incorporated dynamic electric vehicles usages, such as driving times, driving distance, and charging/discharging locations. The machine learning method of principal component analysis and XGBoost were used to develop the solar energy prediction model. We also developed a novel unit commitment model to coordinate and aggregate the distributed energy resources in power generation economic dispatch. Electric vehicle charging was used as elastic demand and electric vehicle discharging was used as power generation sources. The solar energy was considered as a negative load. Simulation results showed that uncontrolled electric vehicle charging and solar energy could negatively impact the power systems. For example, the load ramping rate was increased by 384%. Simulation results also showed that the proposed models could mitigate the negative impact and improve energy efficiency. For example, the peak demand, load ramping rate and average generation cost were reduced by 21%, 79%, and 27%.}

This study proposes a comprehensive multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework for the optimal integration of EVCSs and shunt capacitors (SCs) within the DN, while simultaneously considering the dynamics of the transportation network (TN). To ensure an efficient and sustainable charging infrastructure, a Driving Range-based Traffic Flow Capturing (TFC) model is employed to optimize EV traffic flow coverage, accounting for EV battery constraints and strategic station placement. The proposed framework aims to minimize active power loss (APL) and voltage deviation (VD) in the DN while maximizing EV flow in the TN. To solve this complex multi-objective problem, a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (HGCO) is developed by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO). Objective function normalization is applied to balance the conflicting goals between the DN and TN. The proposed framework was tested on a 33-bus DN and a 25-node TN under three different planning approaches: one focusing on the DN, another on the TN, and a third on their integrated operation. In the integrated planning case, the system recorded an APL of 161.3842 kW and captured 39.45% of electric vehicle flow when battery constraints were applied. Upon removing these constraints, performance improved significantly, with the APL decreasing to 148.5903 kW and EV flow capture rising to 50.52%. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HGCO algorithm effectively balances power system reliability and transportation service efficiency. This integrated planning approach highlights the importance of coordinated EVCS and SC placement in realizing a resilient, efficient, and sustainable electric mobility infrastructure.}

abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), operational challenges such as traffic congestion and power system overload have become increasingly prominent. To address these issues and effectively guide the operation of charging stations (CSs) managed by grid companies (GCs), this paper proposes an optimized CS planning method within multi-coupled networks considering load-balance effects. Firstly, a multi-coupled network topology model is developed by integrating the EV charging network, the transportation network (TN), and the power distribution network (PDN). Then, on the TN level, a load clustering-based method for delineating service areas is proposed, considering the impact of real-time traffic conditions on user charging decisions. On the PDN level, the impact of spatially distributed charging loads on voltage fluctuations is analyzed, and a CS planning model considering load-balancing effects is developed. Finally, an immune genetic algorithm (IGA) is employed to solve the proposed model. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model can reduce total time by 69.26 %, voltage fluctuation rate by 155.09 %, and network loss cost by 45.82 %, thereby validating its economic efficiency and practical effectiveness.}

abstract = {Power quality challenges are a major problem these days because of the significant increase in load demand and the existence of various reasons for disruptions in the distribution system. A voltage sag or a decrease in the magnitude of the line voltage can be brought on by rapid fluctuations in load or distribution system issues. Enhancing the grid current profile, reducing grid voltage sag, and improving other performances can all be achieved through the combination of electric vehicles with distribution generation systems. In this paper, the integration of Distributed Generation with Electric Vehicles in the distribution system has been done to enhance system performances such as true power loss index, imaginary power loss index, voltage deviation index, short circuit current index, cost function, and environmental impact reduction index for 16 bus distribution system in constant impedance, constant current, and constant power load models, or ZIP load models through proper location, sizing, coordinated controlling, and types of Distributed Generation and Electric Vehicle pairs for both charging and discharging modes by adopting Hybrid Genetic Algorithm - Monte Carlo Simulation optimization methodologies. This study's primary goal is to determine the optimal distribution generation and electric vehicle pairing to improve the aforementioned parameters, which will assist researchers in their future planning. Researchers, industry professionals, scientists, and individuals working with Distributed Generation and Electric vehicles in the smart grid will find this statement to be of great use.}

abstract = {The electrification of the transportation sector poses an opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from passenger vehicles. Electric vehicle (EV) charging through dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), known as roadway electrification, could shift EV demand profiles to better coincide with renewable electricity generation. However, this would be a very large new load and few studies evaluate the regional impacts of DWPT charging in a power transmission system. This paper defines methods that address dataset generation for passenger vehicle trips and models to evaluate regional impacts for this emerging technology. Household vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data form localized EV demand profiles through discrete-event simulation. This data serves as exogenous inputs for a Production Cost Model (PCM) of a synthetic transmission system based on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s (ERCOT) network. EV charging methods are compared for both a 2018 baseline generation mixture and a high-renewable generation case incorporating 20 GW of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. The PCM employs unit commitment and economic dispatch (UC&ED) models to compare financial, environmental, and grid reliability impacts from EV charging across passenger EV adoption levels. In-transit charging could reduce grid operational costs by as much as 1.49%, with up to $13.7B saved in annual vehicle operational costs for consumers compared to gas-powered vehicles. Health impacts analysis from power plant and vehicle tailpipe emissions from this study show net health benefits increase by 40% for in-transit charging coupled with high renewable generation. Renewable resources provide an avenue for cost-effective in-transit charging with reduced emissions. The combination of dataset generation and open-source power system modeling establish a foundation for the holistic evaluation of regional DWPT impacts.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the demand for power supply is increasing day by day due to industrialization, population growth, and civilization. Therefore, it is crucial to meet this rising demand by increasing electrical power generation while simultaneously taking care of the environment. This paper proposes a system in which renewable power generation is integrated with conventional and plug-electric vehicles in an effective manner to fulfill the demand for power utilization. The proposed system is tested with unimodal, multimodal, and fixed dimensions benchmark functions for 10-, 20-, 40-, and 100-unit systems using chaotic arithmetic optimization algorithms for the combination of renewable and plug-in electric vehicles to minimize generation costs. The convergence curve shows that the proposed system is effective as compared with the other methods. This study is helpful for scheduling the power generation effectively and at the same time taking care of security constraints and unit commitment problems associated with the system. The main contribution of this paper is testing the results for 10, 20, 40, and 100-unit systems and minimizing the operating cost from $563,427.8 to $547,620.4 for 10 units, $1123,401 to $529,223.7 for 20 units, $2246,014 to $2236,352 for 40 units, and $751,848.665 to $751,778.553 for 100 units using the proposed system. The percentage cost saving is 2.80%, 2.18%, 0.43%, and 0.0094% for 10-, 20-, 40-, and 100-unit systems respectively. The study examines parameters such as mean, median, standard deviation, finest value, power demand, scheduled units, and convergence curve. The results presented in the tables prove that the proposed system is superior to the existing ones. This can result in enhanced power system reliability, reduced emissions, and cost savings.}

abstract = {Significant increase in the installation and penetration of Renewable Energy Resources (RES) has raised intermittency and variability issues in the electric power grid. Solutions based on fast-response energy storage can be costly, especially when dealing with higher renewable energy penetration rate. The rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) also brings challenges to the system planning, dispatching and operation. Due to the random dynamic nature of electric vehicle charging and routing, electric vehicle load can be challenging to the power distribution operators and utilities. The bright side is that the load of EV charging is shiftable and can be leveraged to reduce the variability of renewable energy by consuming it locally. In this paper, we proposed a real-time system that incorporates the concepts of prioritization and cryptocurrency, named SMERCOIN, to incentivize electric vehicle users to collectively charge with a renewable energy-friendly schedule. The system implements a ranking scheme by giving charging priority to users with a better renewable energy usage history. By incorporating a blockchain-based cryptocurrency component, the system can incentivize user with monetary and non-monetary means in a flat-rate system. The effectiveness of the system mechanism has been verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. The system experiment has been implemented on campus of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for 15 months and the results show that the usage of solar energy has increased significantly.}

abstract = {Exhausting fossil fuels and increasing environmental pollutions call for the wider deployment of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which enable the interactions of transportation and electric sectors. The extra loads for charging massive PHEVs could compromise the power system reliability and impose considerable stress on the power system. Transmission line congestions and generation capacity inadequacy could be caused under this circumstance. However, there is little literature which comprehensively studies the impact of large-scale PHEVs on the bulk power system reliability when smart grid technologies are incorporated including smart charging and flexible transmission topology control technologies. This work studies the impacts of different charging strategies and transmission network operation strategies on the bulk power system reliability with high PHEVs integration. An evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the charging load of PHEVs and shave the peak load. A network topology optimization (NTO) operation strategy is employed to lessen the transmission congestions and reduce the load curtailment. Based on the sequential Monte Carlo simulation method, these technologies are integrated into the reliability evaluation process. Numerical studies and sensitivity analysis are conducted on modified IEEE RTS-79 systems. The results verify the effectiveness of the technologies to realize the potential of existing power system infrastructures so as to relieve the stress caused by the PHEVs load, increase the available penetration of PHEVs and promote the bulk power system reliability which is meaningful for power system planning and risk management.}
