abstract = {By-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali processes can help meet the increasing demand for hydrogen fuel in early fuel cell electric vehicle markets (e.g., California) in the U.S. Hydrogen produced from chlor-alkali plants is typically combusted for process heat on site, vented to the atmosphere (i.e., wasted), or sold to the external merchant hydrogen market. Whether it is combusted, vented, or sold as a commodity, relevant information is lacking as to the life-cycle environmental benefits or trade-offs of using by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali plants. A life-cycle analysis framework was employed to evaluate well-to-gate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali processes in comparison with hydrogen from the conventional centralized natural gas steam methane reforming (central SMR) pathway. U.S.-specific, plant-by-plant, and up-to-date chlor-alkali production characteristics were incorporated into the analysis. In addition to the venting and combustion scenarios, to deal with the multi-functionality of the chlor-alkali processes that simultaneously produce chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen, two different co-product allocation strategies were adopted—mass allocation and market value allocation. It was estimated that by-product hydrogen production from chlor-alkali processes creates 1.3–9.8 kg CO2e/kg H2 of life-cycle GHG emissions on average, which is 20–90% less than the conventional central SMR pathway. The results vary with co-product treatment scenarios, regional electric grid characteristics, on-site power generation, product prices, and hydrogen yield. Despite the variations in the results, it was concluded that the life-cycle GHG emission reduction benefits of using by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali processes are robust. With a diverse set of scenario analyses, the study developed a comprehensive and detailed life-cycle GHG emissions inventory of the chlor-alkali by-product hydrogen pathway and quantified sensitivity indices in the context of different assumptions and input parameter values.}

abstract = {With the penetration rate of electric vehicles (EVs) increasing exponentially, the high charging load may cause new issues in future power system, e.g., voltage drop. Besides, EV Charging stations (EVCSs) located in inadequate places exacerbate these issues, causing charging demand to concentrate on a few EVCSs. Therefore, the charging demand estimation for EVCSs and their strategic placement is essential for the system operators and charging station owner. The paper proposes a method for optimal EVCS placement to achieve charging demand dispersion considering not only installation cost but also drivers’ preferences and existing charging stations. To optimally place EVCSs, this work first estimates the charging demand of existing EVCSs based on kernel density estimation. The charging demand for new and existing EVCSs is modeled using the nearest neighbor search to consider drivers’ preference for the nearer station. Next, the EVCS placement problem is formulated to minimize the peak charging demand using integer nonlinear programming, a non-convex problem. To tackle this non-convex problem, a minimax genetic algorithm is proposed, which is genetic algorithm combined with game theory. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulations based on real data from Jeju Island. After applying the proposed method, new EVCS placement is determined by analyzing the tradeoff between the degree of charging demand dispersion and installation cost. As a result, the charging demand concentrated on a particular EVCS is suitably dispersed.}

abstract = {The challenge posed by extreme natural disasters to the resilience of power distribution networks is growing increasingly severe. Electric vehicles, as distributed and mobile energy storage devices, have the potential to enhance the resilience of distribution networks through vehicle to grid technology. In this study, resilience is integrated into the evaluation metrics for charging station layout planning, and a methodology for the layout of electric vehicle charging stations is proposed, balancing both economy and resilience. After constructing a typical extreme disaster scenario model using typhoons as an example, a resilience deployment model for charging stations is developed, which comprehensively considers the resilience of the distribution network and traffic flow. The objective function is designed to minimize the annual total social cost, which includes factors such as construction and operation costs, user usage costs, charging loss costs, and resilience configuration costs. A joint solution algorithm, combining the Voronoi diagram and particle swarm optimization algorithm, is proposed to solve the model. According to the simulation results of an illustrative example, the resilience optimization scenario performs well in terms of load loss penalty. This indicates that, in extreme disaster situations, this planning approach can effectively mitigate losses caused by power outages and improve the reliability and stability of the power system.}

Due to imperfect data about the availability of electric vehicles, the uncertainty of the demand-side increases considerably. To overcome the problem, the power storage capacity of electric vehicles is addressed to provide demand flexibility for the supply-side. This paper proposes a novel structure for parking lot microgrids to provide day-ahead peak-shaving and valley-filling for power systems with distinct peak hours in the daily operation. The microgrid is comprised of electrical demands, e.g. heat ventilation and air conditioning, lighting, escalators, as well as self-generation facilities, including roof-top photovoltaic sites and gas-fired engines. Besides, the parking lot has smart charging stations to charge/discharge the electric vehicles based on the flexibility requirements of power systems and/or owners’ preferences. The microgrid is supplied by the wholesale electricity market and bilateral contracts. To leverage the flexibility potentials of electric vehicles, a data-driven approach is suggested that classifies the electric vehicles based on distinct characteristics, e.g. dwell time and preferred state of charge. The robust optimization approach is adopted to determine the optimum procurement strategies for the microgrid in the worst-case realization of the wholesale market price uncertainty. Finally, the robust-mixed integer linear programming is examined in Iran Power Grid not only to provide flexibility for the power network but also to make a profit for the microgrid.}

abstract = {The transformation towards a sustainable power system calls for new ways of operating the network. In that regard, electric vehicles (EVs) with their charging infrastructure qualify as a flexible resource. This paper interconnects ancillary services and EV flexibility to help system operators (SOs) and flexibility providers understand the role and localize EV-chargers in the power system. First, the focus is on SOs. The manuscript reviews ancillary services based on power system operational challenges. The ancillary services are differentiated between 8 frequency and 32 flexibility services. These are then subdivided depending on the management control: the first group includes inertia, primary, and secondary/tertiary frequency control, while the second includes congestion management, voltage regulation, power quality, grid stability, and emission management. Of all the different services, the ones that can be provided by EV-charger are highlighted and classified into 12 geo-electrical charging clusters. Second, the focus is moved to the flexibility providers. Independently from location, to provide ancillary services with EVs, multiple actors are recognized: the end-user, the charging site operator (CSO), the charging point operator (CPO), the aggregator, the energy community, the distribution system operator (DSO), and the transmission system operator (TSO). The collaboration between the actors is today carried out by making alliances, to help exchange knowledge and gain confidence in ancillary services provision. In conclusion, the literature review presents the characteristics of 27 slow (up to 50 kW) smart chargers, the common flexibility features being scheduling (100%), modulation (89%), and phase switching (10%).}

While demand-side adjustable resources like smart buildings and electric vehicle (EV) stations could enhance grid flexibility, current research remains largely theoretical, lacking field validation and comparative analysis—particularly of their short-timescale dynamic characteristics—which remains largely unexplored. This study develops a rapid frequency response control system leveraging edge terminal on-site detection and control mechanisms to evaluate the practical performance of these real-world resources, through a series of tests, including frequency step, frequency ramp, and hybrid tests. Several key performance parameters, such as response delay time, response time, and regulation time, are assessed and benchmarked against current power grid requirements to establish their compliance. Finally, from the perspective of user-grid demand alignment and future technology trends, a comparative analysis is presented—focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of smart buildings and EV charging stations in providing fast frequency response—along with corresponding development suggestions. This study is being applied to shape demand-side fast frequency response standards for the China Southern Power Grid, addressing the impacts of renewable integration and power system evolution.}

We contrast ex-ante hardening with mobile energy resource and vehicle flexibility, and examine coordination schemes spanning centralized control, virtual power plants, and transactive energy frameworks, while explicitly documenting technical limits, costs, and contexts of use. We integrate deterministic, stochastic and robust, and hybrid learning-optimization models, aligning them with planning, operational, and emergency horizons. We also assess the roles of mobile energy resources and electric vehicles in service restoration and ancillary services through an implementation lens that includes technology maturity, deployment barriers, and market alignment. Finally, we outline an actionable agenda around multi-disaster coupling, queueing- and equity-aware siting and pricing, degradation-aware flexibility economics, feasibility-preserving decentralized markets, and learning-augmented robustness with open benchmarks. Unlike prevailing reviews, the emphasis is on when each method works, what constrains it, and how to deploy it, yielding practical guidance for designing CPTSs that are efficient in routine operation and resilient under high-impact disruptions.}

Several parameters are taken into account as part of this process, such as proximity to load centers, capacity of the power system, and traffic volume. The common charging station location distant from the load centers has been established to enhance the quality of power and reduce 5–10 % of distribution losses. Additionally, site location should also include the area land cost and this cost in the urban area is estimated to be about $500 to $2000 per square meter and other zoning regulations. In the design, the service radius of charging stations is also an important factor; Keeping the battery's DOD between 50 % and 70 % yields an estimated driving range of 150–200 km, which suggests a distance between stations of 50–70 km. In this case, the discount rate of 5 % can be adopted for O&M costs over the planning horizon of 20 years while the capital costs of provision of each station varies from $ 50,000 to $ 200,000 depending on the size of the station. The establishment of a large network for charging the EVs will enhance the power balance of the system thus reducing power losses whilst increasing the penetration of electric vehicles by integrating these numerical aspects together with technology and environmental considerations.}

The present research describes a smart grid consisting of power plants and distributed generation, fueled via photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, and augmented with electric vehicles as power storage devices. Employing a parking lot to deal with challenges such as low penetration of the electric vehicles embedded with Vehicle-to-Grid functionalities encounters two difficulties: where they should be installed, and modeling of bi-directional power flow between electric vehicles, the grid, and the distributed generation system. In this regard, a nonlinear multi-objective problem is designed and solved via employing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, and the forward and backward substitution method. In addition, Newton-Raphson Power Flow is adopted and modified to calculate the power flow of the distribution network. The results related to optimal placement and sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems show that bus 16 of the studied grid is the best place to integrate a parking lot – equipped with 117 photovoltaic and 10 wind turbine units - to the tested IEEE-26 buses. Furthermore, this study suggests that the aforementioned grid could employ a complex versatile control unit able to optimize the operating point, scheduling charging and discharging for a large number of electric vehicles while considering the technical aspects (total active power loss and voltage deviation). In this regard, a new hybrid control approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System tuned via utilizing the optimal power flow problem is proposed. The controller's superiority to handle grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid services is discussed and compared to other studies.}

Here, we assess the impact of demand and supply side-drivers on the long-term evolution of the electricity sector in India under various technology and policy scenarios. Our analysis is based on developing: (a) multiple demand scenarios produced from a bottom-up forecasting model with high temporal resolution that capture structural changes in electricity consumption resulting from (AC) and electric vehicle (EV) adoption, and (b) a multi-period power system capacity expansion model with high temporal resolution of grid operations to model supply-side evolution in response to changes in demand and technology and policy factors. Such a framework allows us to, for example, quantify the impacts of improving appliance efficiency standards for AC systems or shifts in EV charging patterns on power system decarbonization prospects. Under projected renewables and Li-ion storage cost declines, our modeling points to solar and wind generation contributing substantially (46–67%) to meet annual electricity demand in India by 2030. However, without appropriate policy measures to phase out existing coal generation, even such rapid adoption of variable renewable energy coupled with one or more technological levers such as low-cost energy storage and demand-side measures such as setting aggressive AC efficiency standards and deploying distribution level storage, are insufficient to reduce annual CO2 emissions in 2050 vs. 2020 because of the relatively higher growth rate of projected electricity demand over this period. This suggests that deep decarbonization of India's power sector will require policy measures beyond efforts related to accelerating renewables deployment.}

We focus on the European power market to test our hypothesis that it is more cost-efficient to decarbonize when the central power system is coordinated with building heat systems and electric vehicle charging. For Europe as a whole, results show that the average European electricity cost reduces by 3% and transmission expansion decreases by 0.4% when Norwegian heat systems are developed in coordination with the European power system.

The purpose of cost reduction in the presence of the intelligent environment is a challenge that must be investigated so that this platform is suitable for predicting the behaviour of vehicles and, as a result, optimizing their presence in the power network. This research presents a relatively complete radial distribution network development planning model in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the effects of electric vehicles are not considered, and only the effects of distributed production (renewable and dispatchable) are considered. Studies have been done on a sample 54-bus network, a common system in most Distribution expansion planning (DEP) articles for distribution networks. In addition, the real data of American highways have been used to create raw input data. Also, due to the distance limit, the information on vehicles under 100 miles has been received as electric vehicle information. The clustering method and Capiola multivariate probability distribution functions have created suitable vehicle scenarios during different planning years. Capiola’s method increases the accuracy of vehicle load forecasting according to a predetermined growth rate. The DEP problem in this research is modeled as an optimization problem based on scenario, dynamic, and in 5 one-year time frames (5-year time horizon and one-year accuracy). The results indicate that, in the presence of electric vehicles and distributed production sources, the technical characteristics of the network are improved. Similarly, the use of DGs, in addition to reducing the cost of equipment, has reduced undistributed energy in the system. But 10,000 vehicles, which have been applied to the network as an uncontrolled load, have caused an increase in undistributed energy. The cost of equipment required for the network development is almost as much as 5%.}

Distribution network operators (DNO) are investing in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to enable cost reduction through smart grid applications. The DNO also benefits from the additional measurement data the AMI gives for the network planning process. The availability of AMI data can be limited by the cost of communication and by privacy concerns. To determine the social welfare of an AMI, the economic gains should be estimated. For the planning of the low voltage (LV) network, a method for determining the value of an AMI still needs to be developed. Therefore, a planning methodology which allows various levels of measurement data availability has been developed. By applying this approach the value of different levels of AMI from an LV-network planning perspective can be determined. To illustrated the application of this approach a case study for the LV-network of a Dutch DNO is performed. The results show that an increase in measurement data can lead to €49-254 lower LV-network reinforcement costs. A detailed analysis of the results shows that already 50% of the possible cost reduction can be achieved if only 65% of the households have AMI data available.}

abstract = {In power systems, flexibility can be defined as the ability to cope with variability and uncertainty in generation and demand. The ongoing energy transition is affecting how much flexibility is required, but also who should provide it: some existing solutions are being phased out, while new solutions’ entire business models are based on providing flexibility (e.g. storage or demand response). With the intention of condensing information and rationalising debates, a significant number of methods have been proposed to quantify various facets of flexibility; this paper reviews and classifies them depending on the question they attempt to address. We propose a pair of novel tools to quantify a comparatively unexplored aspect of flexibility: who is providing it. These frequency spectrum analysis based tools separately quantify flexibility provision on the annual, weekly and daily timescales. The tools’ effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated through several example applications, analysing both historical and prospective power systems, in several geographical locations with contrasting characteristics. The proposed tools are of particular value to the capacity expansion planner, allowing them to quantify changes in flexibility provision as new solutions are introduced, or as carbon taxes, generation and interconnector capacities evolve.}

Along with residential plug-in electric vehicle charging, the public charging infrastructure is much needed to reduce plug-in electric vehicles' range anxiety and foster their adoption. Renewable energy and demand management programs are considered viable options that can reduce the impacts of widespread plug-in electric vehicle penetration on the electric grid. This research studies the impacts of plug-in electric vehicle direct current fast charging on a simulated standalone retail building's peak demand and energy consumption, and presents the ability of renewable energy and demand management options to reduce their impacts. Additionally, insights into a public charge station usage are presented by monitoring different types of plug-in electric vehicle charge behaviors at a retail site. Research findings indicate that demand management of building end-use loads along with the use of solar photovoltaic can contribute to absorbing plug-in electric vehicle penetration at the building level ranging from the average of 7% for the demand management option alone to an average of 38% for the combination of demand management and solar photovoltaic, and contributing to shifting building peak demand to late evening hours.}

Oemof framework, a linear programming model, is then used to analyse the regional energy system with a multi-node representation integrating smart charging and vehicle-to-grid options with a multi-node representation at the regional scale. Baseline results without demand management indicate peak load increases of 12–59 % by 2030–2050. Implementing smart charging for passenger cars in the high electrification 2050 scenario reduces this peak by 34 % by aligning loads to renewable generation surplus periods. Enabling vehicle-to-grid technology yields an additional 60 % reduction in imports from surrounding regions by utilizing electric vehicles as distributed energy resources.

Mitigating these impacts requires optimal planning that accounts for RES variability and additional EV charging demand. This paper presents a novel approach for the simultaneous optimal allocation and sizing of RES and EV charging stations, along with coordinated management of the charging process. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and supply costs, and EV battery costs. The model incorporates coefficients based on wind speed, solar radiation, and hourly peak demand to manage EV charging during off-peak hours. A hybrid Harris Hawk Optimization–Sine Cosine Algorithm (HHO-SCA) is proposed to develop a meta-heuristic-based RES and EVs charging system. By integrating SCA features into HHO, the algorithm enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities, thereby improving global search efficiency and optimizing energy usage. The performance of HHO-SCA has been validated on benchmark functions. The HHO-SCA is employed to solve the proposed optimization problem across five scenarios. Its effectiveness for simultaneous optimal siting and sizing of RES and EV charging stations is validated on the IEEE 33 and 69 bus system. Results indicate that HHO-SCA outperforms other methods by effectively avoiding local optima and exhibiting superior convergence behavior.}

Implementation strategies in the use of energy efficiency can be made by utilizing more energy-efficient equipment or increasing penetration rate of production of new sources of energy at the generating side. These new sources of energy can be renewable sources, especially wind resource and energy storage instruments such as grid-connected electric vehicles. The vehicles can be charged during the low load and discharged during peak load. In this study, wind resources and grid-connected electric vehicles are considered as an approach for energy efficiency strategies in generation expansion planning. But, because of high investment cost, great uncertainty of wind resources’ productivity and uncertainty of their supportive policies no one will invest on them without proper supportive policies in a competitive environment. So support policies for wind resource are also considered. One of the fundamental problems of supportive policies is financial support in a competitive environment. Therefore, as an innovation of the paper, grid-connected electric vehicles is used to solve the problem. In the paper, the impact of these vehicles is considered in a way that they act integrated with wind resources and thus increases the capacity factor of wind resources.}

However, there are limited studies on the energy flexibility quantification and enhancement of the sophisticated building energy systems. In this study, a nonlinear component-based model, integrating building integrated photovoltaics and vehicle integrated photovoltaics, was developed for the energy flexibility assessment. A generic methodology with a series of quantifiable energy flexibility indicators (the off-peak renewable-discharging ratio and the off-peak grid-discharging ratio) has been presented to quantify the energy flexibility of the hybrid grid-connected building–vehicle system. Two dynamic advanced grid-responsive energy control strategies have been proposed for the energy flexibility enhancement. Techno-economic feasibility has been discussed regarding different off-peak electricity tariffs and different rated renewable capacities. Moreover, a technical solution is presented to solve the energy congestion contradiction regarding the exploitation of the off-peak grid electricity and the on-site renewable energy through electrical storage systems. The research results showed that the proposed renewable-to-demand and the off-peak grid-supported storage control (Control Strategy 3) shows the robustness and competitiveness, in terms of activating both the on-site renewable system and the grid to participate in the building energy system. By implementing the Control Strategy 3, 96.8% of the grid electricity can be shifted from the off-peak period to the peak period for the usage of the office building. Depending on the critical static battery capacity at 10 kWh for each floor, the energy congestion contradiction can be solved by managing the off-peak grid-battery charging power to minimise the energy-based operational cost. This study formulates a flexible energy management system and a flexible energy control strategy, which are important for the promotion of energy flexible buildings, with participation of both the policymakers and the householders.}

The study also provides interesting guidelines for potential users and system designers. Two case studies are presented: i) the taxi fleet of the city centre of Naples and ii) the cargo vans of the city of Salerno; both towns are in Southern Italy. For each case, the hourly power consumption of the vehicles was evaluated, as a function of the daily trip length. An accurate procedure was implemented to select the sites suitable for the installation of the charging stations, including a photovoltaic field and an electric storage system. A comparison was also performed between two different electric storage technologies: lead-acid and lithium-ion battery. The case studies were analysed by means of a detailed dynamic simulation model, developed in TRNSYS. A sensitivity analysis was also performed, to evaluate how different values of the most important design and operating parameters affect the system overall performance. It was found that the results are mostly affected by solar field area, capacity of the energy storage system and investment cost. The comparison between the two selected storage technologies did not exhibit significant differences. For both the cases investigated, it was found that, during the summer, solar energy covers an important amount of the total energy demand. On the contrary, in winter the amount of energy provided by the public electric grid was high. From an economic point of view, assuming a lithium-ion battery capital cost equal to 90 €/kWh, acceptable pay-back periods (about 6 years) were obtained, for both the applications considered.}

The expansion and development of renewable power generation technologies is conducive in promoting the use of electric vehicles, which are more environmentally friendly. This paper proposes a multi-objective power expansion model considering renewable energy policy objectives. The model regards the problem as a multi-period optimisation task, taking the newly installed capacity and the power generation capacity of each power generation technology as decision variables, and simulating the uncertain factors in the planning process using Geometric Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo approaches. The optimisation objective of the model is to minimise expected costs, reduce risk and environmental impacts, and incorporate changing policy objectives into the constraints to meet policy makers’ expectations for renewable energy development. Then, a decentralised target search-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Its effectiveness is verified by a numerical example using real data from the Chinese power system. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits improved performance compared with benchmark algorithms and provides high quality and diverse Pareto-optimal solutions to decision makers. Finally, the optimal plans for power expansion and generation mix under different preferences and policy objectives are discussed and corresponding recommendations are made.}

Charging sites in particular will have to face strong challenges especially in those countries where a massive penetration of electric vehicles happened in the last years and even more is expected in the forthcoming future. Such an increased forecast demand will lead to a capacity lack within the existing charging sites, therefore new investments in design and expansion have to be planned. We propose the so called SMACS MODEL that stands for Stochastic Multihorizon Approach for Charging Sites Management, Operations, Design and Expansion under Limited capacity conditions. The model is built to analyse critical decisions in terms of transformer expansion, grid reinforcements, renewable installation and storage integration, over a time horizon of 10 years, with a particular focus on the long term uncertainty in the price variations of the available resources. Long term investment decisions and short term operational decisions are addressed simultaneously in a holistic approach that includes also battery degradation issues and is able to tackle the optimal trade off between battery replacements, grid reinforcements and renewable installations throughout the chosen time horizon. Compared to traditional decision approaches the model is able to take more precise decisions due to its higher insight on the long term costs projections, the inclusion of battery degradation issues and the inclusion of grid rules and regulations limits that affect the final decisions.}

Moreover, the absence of optimized short-term operational models for EV integration poses challenges in grid management. To bridge these gaps, this research proposes a socio-economic model to estimate EV sales based on the Bass diffusion model and macroeconomic regressions. Additionally, it integrates electricity system expansion planning using the OSeMOSYS tool with a short-term operational model based on unit commitment. In this context, this work endeavors to develop a methodology for estimating the impact of V2G technology, considering both the deployment and utilization of EVs in a Brazilian case study. Applying traditional methodologies that do not consider operational system models can lead to potential future load shedding. It may accentuate disparities between long-term and short-term outcomes, especially with EV and V2G integration. The proposed methodology corrected the overestimation of the energy injection potential of EVs by the traditional model, indicating the need to consider both the expansion and the operation of the electricity system when planning the integration of EVs.}

At the same time, this integrates millions of mobile storage units into the electricity system, which has a rising need for flexibility to balance the intermittent generation from photovoltaic systems and wind turbines. To capture the potential of electric cars as a flexibility resource, we simulate 7,000 vehicle driving profiles in an agent-based model, generating load profiles as well as charging power and state-of-charge boundaries for the German car fleet, which serve as restrictions in energy system optimization. In a scenario-based study for Germany in 2030 and 2045, we compare the installed electric capacities in the optimized system, depending on whether electric vehicle charging is uncontrolled, controlled, or bidirectional. Here we show that a bidirectionally charged car fleet has the potential to replace 32 GW (84 %) of stationary battery storage and 31 GW (64 %) of hydrogen-fired peaking power plants, while enabling an additional solar power expansion of 7 GW (2 %) until 2045. Notably, implementing vehicle-to-grid can limit hydrogen-fired electricity generation to winter months and enable a shift toward combined heat and power plants. On the demand side, it can reduce the expansion of electrolyzers by 19 GW (28 %) and power-to-heat capacities by 25 GW (60 %). Overall, the integrated energy system can substantially benefit from the implementation of smart and especially bidirectional charging as it lowers the need for future capacity expansion in the electricity system but also in coupled hydrogen and heat systems.}

Among various factors influential to the EVCS allocation, charging satisfaction and distributed renewables integration were mainly considered in this paper. First, with System Dynamics (SD) model, the key factors affecting the EVCS allocation were identified from the conduction mechanism. Then, focusing on the site selection of EVCS from the aspect of user satisfaction, k-means clustering method was used to illustrate the relationship between charging distance and satisfaction degree. On this basis, considering with renewables integration and stable operation of power system, the paper constructed a multi-objective function including voltage fluctuation, load fluctuation and connected capacity of energy storage in EVCS. Third, under the feeder framework of an IEEE 33-node, GA-PSO was employed to determine the best solution of EVCS allocation., i.e. the optimal allocation number of EVCS, the site and capacity of EVCS, and the access nodes of renewables and EVCS. Combing with the analysis results, suggestions from the aspects of technology standard, finance subsidy, land use support and energy management were proposed for accelerating the generalization of EVs and strengthening the supporting infrastructure construction.}

abstract = {Energy, and particularly electricity, has played and will continue to play a very important role in the development of human society. Electricity, which is the most flexible and manageable energy form, is currently used in a variety of activities and applications. For instance, electricity is used for heating, cooling, lighting, and for operating electronic appliances and electric vehicles. Nowadays, given the rapid development and commercialization of technologies and devices that rely on electricity, electricity demand is increasing faster than overall primary energy supply. Consequently, the design and planning of power systems is becoming a progressively more important issue in order to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in timely fashion, not only in developed countries but particularly in developing economies where electricity demand is increasing even faster. Power systems are networks of electrical devices, such as power plants, transformers, and transmission lines, used to produce, transmit, and supply electricity. The design and planning of such systems require the selection of generation technologies, along with the capacity, location, and timing of generation and transmission capacity expansions to meet electricity demand over a long-term horizon. This manuscript presents a comprehensive optimization framework for the design and planning of interconnected power systems, including the integration of generation and transmission capacity expansion planning. The proposed framework also considers renewable energies, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, demand-side management (DSM), as well as reserve and CO2 emission constraints. The novelty of this framework relies on an integrated assessment of the aforementioned features, which can reveal possible interactions and synergies within the power system. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a suite of case studies inspired by a real-world power system, including “business as usual” and “CO2 mitigation policy” scenarios. These case studies illustrated the adaptability and effectiveness of the framework at dealing with typical situations that can arise in designing and planning power systems.}

Due to the strong coupling between hydrogen and electric energy systems, considering the role of hydrogen in power system planning can increase the penetration rate of renewable energy and help the low-carbon transition. This paper uses planning and economic analysis to determine the path to a low-carbon transition in East China. First, an electricity-hydrogen coupling generation and transmission expansion planning model is constructed with the total system planning cost as the objective function. Then, a low-dimensional matrix modeling method that considers energy conversion equipment, energy storage equipment, demand response and energy networks is proposed. Finally, the planning results of various scenarios and the low-carbon transition path under the optimal scenario are analyzed, and the impacts of the cost of hydrogen production through water electrolysis and the charging mode of electric vehicles are also investigated. The case study results show that the proposed low-dimensional matrix modeling method can effectively solve the long-term planning problem for large-scale systems, and changes in the expected carbon neutral time will affect the speed and scale of the expansion of power generation and transmission capacity at each stage. The case study also indicates that electricity-hydrogen coupling reduces carbon emissions and total planning costs by 18.8 % and 10.7 %, respectively and reduce 38 % imported energy from other regions for East China.}

abstract = {In this chapter, several key sections including hydrogen (H2) utilization and applications are examined in detail. This chapter covers both mature and industrialized applications and fuel applications. Mature and industrialized applications are explored in oil refineries, the chemical sector, metallurgical processes, and other relevant fields (e.g., energy carriers, electricity generation, and effective energy-storing mediums). Fuel applications are investigated in relation to their roles in the aeronautics and space sectors, internal combustion engines, H2 fuel cell (FC) electric vehicles, and stand-alone power systems. In addition, various FC systems are reviewed, with challenges for safe and efficient use, operating conditions, and potential applications being identified and discussed. Then, the diverse methods and challenges of transporting H2 as a crucial element in the transition to cleaner energy sources are explored. Road transportation, utilizing tube trailers such as the TITAN, is optimal for shorter distances (distance of 160km) and limited demand scenarios. Liquid H2 delivery is considered economical for intermediate distances (over 300km) and high demands, although its viability for high-demand situations remains uncertain. Ocean transportation, despite its energy-intensive liquefaction process, has been explored, with various projects including the EQHHPP (Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Pilot Project) and WE-NET (World Energy Network) facing challenges due to impractical costs. However, renewed interest, particularly after events such as the Fukushima nuclear accident, has stimulated recent Japanese projects. H2 pipelines, with examples such as Air Liquide’s network, have seen significant development, primarily for local distribution and large-scale interregional energy transport. Fueling stations, crucial for the adoption of H2 vehicles, have proliferated globally, with off-site configurations being more prevalent due to different factors such as electricity tariffs and equipment limitations. Liquid H2 stations are preferred for safety reasons. Despite the promise of H2 as a clean energy carrier, transporting it presents challenges. Energy requirements for compression and liquefaction are significant, with material selection for pipelines crucial to prevent corrosion. Safety measures face obstacles due to H2 unique properties, including its low flammability limit. In conclusion, while H2 offers immense potential for a cleaner energy future, addressing the challenges of its transportation is essential for its widespread adoption. Continued research and innovation are needed to optimize transportation methods, enhance safety measures, and reduce energy requirements.}

Hence, an optimal siting and sizing approach for an electric taxi (ET) charging station is proposed in this study, considering both transportation and power system needs. In addition, particular attention to taxi drivers' needs is considered. Fixed installation costs, land costs, and trip costs are the factors evaluated in this proposed approach. A network modeling approach based on a winner-takes-all edge trimming was used to identify interest points of the city in terms of traffic flows. Ecuador's capital, Quito, was considered a case study. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to address traffic flow uncertainties such as trip expenses and restrictions.}

Nevertheless, they bring about adversities such as uncertainty in production-load sides, augmented power loss, and voltage instability in the power system, which should be carefully addressed to increase the reliability. In this concern, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization methodology for sizing and siting of SDGs, WDGs, and capacitor banks (CBs) in the power system considering uncertainties stemmed from PEVs load demand, solar irradiance, wind speed, and the conventional load. The understudy objectives are the voltage stability index, green-house gas emissions, and the total cost. An unconventional point estimate method (PEM) is used to handle the related uncertainties, and chance-constrained programming method is deployed to deal with smooth constraints. The corresponding probability distribution functions of output variables are estimated by the maximum entropy method. Furthermore, robustness analysis is made by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed methodology is applied to a typical radial distribution network. The results show that the presence of PEV’s significantly increases the load demand, which results in voltage collapse in the distribution system without the presence of distributed generations. However, the proposed probabilistic method ensures the safe operation of the distribution system with the optimal allocation of renewable distributed generations and CBs. Moreover, the results of deterministic and probabilistic cases are compared under different penetration levels of PEVs. The best tradeoff solution of the Pareto front is selected by the fuzzy satisfying method.}

This paper proposes a multi-stage investment optimization framework that integrates wildfire-induced disruptions, heatwave-driven demand surges, and carbon-neutral transition pathways into long-term power system planning. The framework employs a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach to account for uncertainties in wildfire spread, transmission failures, and climate variability, ensuring robustness against worst-case scenarios. A GIS-driven wildfire risk assessment is incorporated to prioritize infrastructure reinforcements, microgrid deployment, and renewable integration in high-risk regions. The model balances three key objectives: (i) minimizing infrastructure investment costs, (ii) maximizing grid resilience through fire-adaptive expansion planning, and (iii) ensuring a carbon-neutral transition in alignment with climate policies. A case study of Los Angeles County during the 2025 Eaton Fire demonstrates the model’s effectiveness in enhancing power grid resilience and optimizing energy investment strategies under extreme climate conditions. The results highlight significant reductions in carbon emissions, improved microgrid reliability, and accelerated post-wildfire grid recovery, showcasing the model’s applicability for future wildfire-prone energy systems.}

Utilizing a modified IEEE 118-bus radial distribution system (RDS), segmented into residential, commercial, and industrial zones, the black widow optimization (BWO) algorithm is employed to optimally size and site VPPs, minimizing operational costs and maximizing system resilience. Renewable energy uncertainty is modeled via the two-point estimation method, with performance assessed using key resilience metrics like energy not supplied (ENS) and load restoration index (LRI). Simulation results demonstrate the BWO-based strategy’s superior performance, reducing total objective cost to $2.54 million, outperforming genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) by 5.01% and 8.54% respectively. Furthermore, it achieves the lowest ENS, highest LRI across critical zones, and exhibits faster convergence with fewer fitness evaluations. This work highlights the significant potential of VPP-enabled MGs coupled with bio-inspired optimization to improve power system resilience under adverse conditions.}

However, sector coupling integrating electricity, heating and transportation can play a key role as a source of demand-side flexibility to support the system in managing uncertainty resulting from the integration of renewable and distributed energy resources. In this paper, we proposed an operational framework for vehicle-to-everything operation of electric vehicle fleets with mixed-use buildings acting as charging stations for demand-side flexibility provision. The proposed framework provides aggregators with risk-aware flexibility quantification, robust market bids, and real-time control decisions. It uniquely combines sector coupling with stochastic optimization and predictive control to enhance energy management at site level and unlock new revenue generation from flexibility provision. Our contribution advances the state-of-the-art by enabling coordinated, uncertainty-aware flexibility provision across multiple sites, while integrating both electric and thermal systems into a unified operational framework. The approach was tested on real demonstrators in Switzerland and Spain, highlighting the cost–benefits of demand-side flexibility provision, which resulted in monthly net revenues that far surpassed the energy costs of the charging station. We found out that electric vehicles provide substantial flexibility due to their inherent ability to shift loads across multiple sites; the flexibility provided by heat pumps in small residential units is not sufficient but plays a more significant role in large residential units, such as multi-family houses, underscoring the interdisciplinary potential of coupling transportation, heating, and electricity systems for more resilient and efficient system energy management.}

In consequence, the public attention has shifted upstream and holistically towards the integration of large-scale transportation electrification to power systems. This paper proposes a method to identify bottlenecks in power transmission systems to accommodate large-scale and stochastic electric vehicles charging demands. First, a distributionally robust chance-constrained direct current optimal power flow model is developed to quantify the impacts of stochastic electric vehicles charging demands. Subsequently, an agent-based model with the trip-chain method is applied to obtain the spatiotemporal distributions of electric vehicles charging demands for both light-duty electric vehicles and medium and heavy-duty electric vehicles. The first two moments of those distributions are extracted to build an ambiguity set of electric vehicles charging demands. Finally, a 121-bus synthetic transmission network for New York State power systems is used to validate the future transportation electrification in New York State from 2025 to 2035. Results show that the large-scale transportation electrification in New York State will account for approximately 13.33 % to 16.79 % of the total load demand by 2035. The transmission capacity is the major bottleneck in supporting New York State to achieve its transportation electrification. To resolve the bottlenecks, we explore some possible solutions, such as transmission capacity expansion and distributed energy resources investment. Wind power shows an advantage over solar energy in terms of total operational costs due to better peak alignment between wind power and electric vehicles charging demand.}

The building stock, including electric vehicles, can offer flexibility, but it is still unclear towards which objective the flexibility should be provided. Further, it is complicated for end-users to react to market prices. This paper investigates how buildings adapt their electricity use by following pre-defined tactics, known as heuristics, instead of market prices. Two heuristics are studied in two future scenarios compliant with European renovation policies. Based on the responses towards the heuristics, this study explores how flexibility from the Norwegian building stock impact electricity production and cross-border exchanges towards 2040. Results show that hourly electricity delivery to the building stock can be strongly modified, resulting in decreased peak electricity delivery by 10%–12% in 2040 when following the heuristics. Nevertheless, findings suggest limited impact on the strategic investments in the power market as flexible Norwegian hydropower adapts production patterns towards economic and operational stability in response to the demand-side load modifications. Further research should continue exploring local impacts of flexibility heuristics, including grid bottlenecks and on-site electricity production integration, and refine assumptions about hydropower flexibility in aggregated power system models.}

This study tackles the critical challenge of aligning investment and planning between these systems, specifically considering the impact of EV charging behaviors. To address this issue, we propose a novel tri-level optimization framework that incorporates a quasi-variational inequality (QVI) model to effectively capture the interactions between user equilibrium (UE) in transportation networks and elastic EV charging demand. The upper level of the model optimizes investments in power systems, including distributed generation and charging infrastructure. The middle level concentrates on expanding road capacity, while the lower level resolves the traffic flow patterns under user equilibrium with elastic charging behaviors (UE-ECB) using the QVI approach. By transforming the tri-level model into a bi-level optimization program with quasi-variational inequality (OP-QVI) formulation, we achieve computational tractability and provide efficient solutions. Results show that the elastic charging demand model outperforms the non-elastic assumption, reducing total costs by 22.2 %, with power system investments down by 19.1 % and transportation system investments down by 39.8 %. These findings demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, avoiding the overestimation of infrastructure needs. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm efficiently solves complex integrated planning problems, ensuring both computational effectiveness and economic viability in system-wide optimization.}

Hydrogen fuel produced by renewable sources such as the solar and wind energy can be an alternative fuel to depress the use of fuels based on fossil sources in the transport sector for sustainable clean energy strategy in future. By replacing the primary fuel with hydrogen fuel produced using renewable sources in road transport sector, environmental benefits can be achieved. In the present study, techno-economic analysis of hydrogen refuelling station powered by wind-photovoltaics (PV) hybrid power system to be installed in İzmir-Çeşme, Turkey is performed. This analysis is carried out to a design of hydrogen refuelling station which is refuelling 25 fuel cell electric vehicles on a daily basis using hybrid optimisation model for electric renewable (HOMER) software. In this study, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) surface meteorology and solar energy database were used. Therefore, the average wind speed during the year was assessed to be 5.72 m/s and the annual average solar irradiation was used to be 5.08 kW h/m2/day for the considered site. According to optimisation results obtained for the proposed configuration, the levelised cost of hydrogen production was found to be US $7.526–7.866/kg in different system configurations. These results show that hydrogen refuelling station powered by renewable energy is economically appropriate for the considered site. It is expected that this study is the pre-feasibility study and obtained results encougare the hydrogen refuelling station to be established in Turkey by inventors or public institutions.}

Most previous studies have not considered real-world traffic distribution data and weather conditions in predicting the electric vehicle charging demand. In this paper, the historical traffic data and weather data of South Korea were used to formulate the forecasting model. The forecasting processes include a cluster analysis to classify traffic patterns, a relational analysis to identify influential factors, and a decision tree to establish classification criteria. The considered variables in this study were the charging starting time determined by the real-world traffic patterns and the initial state-of-charge of a battery. Example case studies for electric vehicle charging demand during weekdays and weekends in summer and winter were presented to show the different charging load profiles of electric vehicles in the residential and commercial sites. The presented forecasting model may allow power system engineers to anticipate electric vehicle charging demand based on historical traffic data and weather data. Therefore, the proposed electric vehicle charging demand model can be the foundation for the research on the impact of charging electric vehicles on the power system.}

This paper presents a two-stage day-ahead peer-to-peer pricing and power exchange among local market participants, including the upstream grid, consumers, prosumers, and electric vehicles (EVs). In the first stage, initial pricing is determined by the mid-market rate pricing method, considering the declared demand of each participant and forecasting the solar production of prosumers based on the demand response program. The random behavior of electric vehicles is modeled in the second stage via scenario generation and final pricing, and then, the electrical power exchanged between participants is determined considering the stochastic mechanism of EVs’ charging and discharging. The proposed two-objective problem is formulated as a single objective by the epsilon constraint method. The proposed mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) is solved in GAMS using the DICOPT solver.

We identify six adoption scenarios that combine deployment levels of rooftop solar photovoltaic modules (PV), electric vehicle charging (EV), and battery storage in residential and commercial customers connected to representative feeders in Indiana by 2025 and 2040. Indiana is a good proxy for many U.S. states with low current DER adoption but potentially high future growth. The economic value of DER is assessed by developing capacity expansion and power flow analysis of the generation and distribution segments, respectively, under future hourly demand assumptions based on each adoption scenarios. Results for the distribution system power flow simulations show that voltage violations are relatively rare. Voltage violations can be mitigated at a very low cost using a combination of smart inverters in future rooftop PV systems and voltage adjustments in the feeder heads. Line loading issues are minimal, with only 0.2% of simulation hours showing loading levels above 100% of capacity. Generation capacity impacts are driven by unmanaged EV charging and could be mitigated with charging management. We estimate that the incremental rate impact from power system investment and operation of increased DER adoption in Indiana will be between −1.6% to + 2% in 2025 and + 0.2% to + 15% in 2040 relative to the base case.}

abstract = {Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which enables bidirectional power flow between electric vehicles (EVs) and power grids, is a possible solution for integrating EVs and renewable energy (RE) into the power system. While EV drivers are indispensable components for the V2G applications, the extant power system studies have underexamined the willingness of EV drivers to participate in V2G. In addition, few studies investigate whether the small-scale and time-varying V2G supply can replace utility-level energy storage. Given this background, this study combined discrete choice experiments with energy storage capacity expansion planning (ES-CEP) to simulate time-varying V2G participation and effectiveness. The choice experiments identified drivers’ preferences for V2G, which was used to simulate V2G participation under different compensation schemes. Time-varying V2G participation was integrated into ES-CEP for renewable-dominant power system to assess the potential of V2G to replace ES at the utility scale. The results showed that most drivers were unlikely to engage in V2G, although this reluctance decreased during the night. Higher guaranteed state-of-charge, accessible V2G facilities, and monetary enrollment compensation encouraged the participation. The ES-CEP results showed that, even with a limited V2G (4.5–15.3 % of EV drivers), V2G significantly reduced the optimal ES capacity (36.5–45.6 % for power and 39.6–60.6 % for energy), shaved peak netload by 18.5 %, and saved the total cost by 3.35 %, even after accounting for V2G enrollment compensation and battery degradation. EVs that charged during the daytime and participated in V2G at night were the most utilized, resulting in 0.92 % of annual battery aging, but generated a profit of 636,749 KRW (553 USD). The findings of this study underscore the importance of a suitable compensation scheme for V2G and supplementary measures for incentivizing EV charging during off-peak hours, as these elements are essential for the successful implementation of V2G.}

Different from the previous studies which mostly utilize programming (optimization) models, this paper employed a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to consider some subjective but important criteria for EVCS site selection. To reflect the ambiguity and vagueness due to the subjective judgments of decision makers, fuzzy TOPSIS method was applied to select the optimal EVCS site. Based on academic literatures, feasibility research reports and expert opinions in different fields, the evaluation index system for EVCS site selection was built from sustainability perspective, which consists of environmental, economic and social criteria associated with a total of 11 sub-criteria. Then, the criteria performances of different alternatives and criteria weights were judged by five groups of expert panels in the fields of environment, economy, society, electric power system and transportation system. Finally, the EVCS site alternatives were ranked by employing fuzzy TOPSIS method. The result shows EVCS site A2 located at Changping district in Beijing obtains the highest ranking score and should be selected as the optimal site. Meanwhile, the environmental and social criteria are paid more attentions from decision makers than economic criteria. The sensitivity analysis results indicate the alternative A2 always secures its top ranking no matter how sub-criteria weights change. It is effective and robust to apply fuzzy TOPSIS method into EVCS site selection. This paper provides a new research perspective for site selection and also extends the application domains of fuzzy TOPSIS method.}

The deployment of EVCSs/EVBSS(s) in the RDS consumes additional active power from the power system. To enhance the system sustainability, it is essential to incorporate the renewable distributed generations (DGs) (like solar photovoltaic (SPV), wind turbine (WT) and biomass) and distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) of best size at suitable site in the RDS to reduce the unfavorable effects of EVCSs/EVBSS(s) demand. In addition, a novel multi-objective student psychology based optimization (MOSPBO) technique is proposed to obtain the best site and size of renewable DGs and DSTATCOM in medium RDS (such as IEEE 33-node) and large-scale RDS (like practical Brazil 136-node) for four different load models contemplating the time-sequence curves of load demand and generation of SPV and WT over 96-h. The proposed MOSPBO method is initially scrutinized on multi-objective benchmark test functions to verify its optimization proficiency. The obtained outcomes reveal that the proposed algorithm yields exceptional performance in searching for the complete pareto sets and pareto front on the considered benchmark test functions. The simulation results reveal that the attained positions and size of renewable DGs and DSTATCOM along with EVCSs/EVBSS(s) in the RDS employing MOSPBO method may be viable ones. The attained outcomes will undoubtedly benefit the power distribution and EV companies in enhancing the proficiency and dependability of the system.}

The presence of these stations is crucial in facilitating the provision of fuel for FCEVs, which rely on hydrogen as a source of power generation. Renewable energy sources offer significant advantages for hydrogen production at these stations, as they are environmentally friendly and can reduce costs. In this study, it is provided a techno-economic analysis of an on-site hydrogen refuelling station powered by a hybrid renewable energy generation system using HOMER software in Niğde, Türkiye, and Zaragoza, Spain. Three different power system scenarios were evaluated to refuel 24 vehicles per day for each region throughout the year. The results of the analysis showed that the most optimal system architecture for Niğde was with a solar panel power generation system, with a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 6.15 $/kg and the net present cost (NPC) of $6,832,393. The most optimal system architecture for Zaragoza was a wind turbine-photovoltaic panel power generation system, with an LCOH of 5.83 $/kg and NPC of $6,499,723. The annual amount of CO2 emissions avoided by using renewable resources in hydrogen production was calculated as 2,673,453 kg for Niğde and 2,366,573 kg for Zaragoza. The study also found that the cost of hydrogen production increases with decreasing the HRS production capacity. The use of renewable energy generation systems for hydrogen production will enable countries to achieve net-zero emission targets and reduce the need to import fossil fuels to meet energy demands in the transportation sector. The present study makes several contributions towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (3, 7, 11, and 13) and has the potential to facilitate the rapid adoption of FCEVs.}

abstract = {Transmission expansion planning (TEP) integrating electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) is pivotal for the transition toward cleaner and more sustainable energy systems. One of the biggest challenges in TEP with EVs and RESs is the uncertainty inherent in their behaviors. Managing this uncertainty is critical for ensuring the grid's reliability and resilience, and for facilitating a seamless transition to EVs. A potent method for addressing uncertainties in power systems is the application of a scenario-based approach. However, the efficiency of this approach is contingent upon an increase in the number of representative scenarios, which, in turn, escalates computational time, making solving the TEP problem a crucial task. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-objective resilience model for TEP, to advance towards more sustainable energy systems. The model seeks to strike a balance between economic, environmental, and technical considerations by minimizing planning costs, carbon dioxide emissions, and enhancing the voltage profile. Furthermore, the paper proposes a cascaded intelligent strategy to handle uncertainties and reduce computational complexity by reducing the number of representative scenarios without compromising system reliability. The adaptive neuro-inference system is designed to manage long-term uncertainties, while two fuzzy systems are developed to address short-term uncertainties. The problem is formulated as a complex non-linear multi-objective optimization problem. To address this, a hybrid approach combining the mountain gazelle optimizer and the multi-objective salp swarm optimizer is developed to solve the problem. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on two separate test systems, demonstrating its superiority in maintaining system reliability while reducing computing time by at least 92 % in comparison with the considered traditional methods. The results also highlight the superior performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm compared to existing meta-heuristic algorithms in solving the TEP.}

Key concerns include voltage deviations and increased active power losses due to the high penetration of EVCSs. This study proposes a comprehensive multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework for the optimal integration of EVCSs and shunt capacitors (SCs) within the DN, while simultaneously considering the dynamics of the transportation network (TN). To ensure an efficient and sustainable charging infrastructure, a Driving Range-based Traffic Flow Capturing (TFC) model is employed to optimize EV traffic flow coverage, accounting for EV battery constraints and strategic station placement. The proposed framework aims to minimize active power loss (APL) and voltage deviation (VD) in the DN while maximizing EV flow in the TN. To solve this complex multi-objective problem, a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (HGCO) is developed by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO). Objective function normalization is applied to balance the conflicting goals between the DN and TN. The proposed framework was tested on a 33-bus DN and a 25-node TN under three different planning approaches: one focusing on the DN, another on the TN, and a third on their integrated operation. In the integrated planning case, the system recorded an APL of 161.3842 kW and captured 39.45% of electric vehicle flow when battery constraints were applied. Upon removing these constraints, performance improved significantly, with the APL decreasing to 148.5903 kW and EV flow capture rising to 50.52%. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HGCO algorithm effectively balances power system reliability and transportation service efficiency. This integrated planning approach highlights the importance of coordinated EVCS and SC placement in realizing a resilient, efficient, and sustainable electric mobility infrastructure.}

Moreover, long-term developments in the power sector are characterized by great uncertainty, which increases the risk of making incorrect investment decisions leading to stranded assets. A cost-effective system integration of electrified transport would therefore not be possible without the implementation of smart charging concepts in combination with strategic network expansion planning that considers the impact of uncertainties. This paper proposes investment and operation models of Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V), Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), and Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) for the large-scale and long-term network expansion planning problem under multi-dimensional uncertainty. Additionally, it presents a multi-stage stochastic planning framework that can identify optimal investment strategies such that the expected system cost is minimized and the risk of stranded investments is reduced. The models are demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus test system and applied in a case study of the power system of Great Britain. The results highlight G2V, V2G and V2B as effective non-network alternatives to conventional reinforcement that could generate substantial economic savings and act as hedging instruments against uncertainty. For the case of Great Britain, the Option Values of G2V, V2G, and V2B could amount to £1.2bn, £10.8bn, and £10.1bn, respectively, over a 40-year horizon. Although the quantified values are system-specific, the paper presents key observations on the role of smart charging concepts as investment options that can be generalized for any low-carbon power system.}

For this purpose, a long-term generation and transmission expansion co-optimization model is used, which captures the hourly operational dynamics of the system by means of the use of representative days. This is relevant since smart charging schemes for Electric Vehicles (EVs) are available, and their benefits are intertwined with the hourly available generation (especially solar), the level of demand, and the transmission capacity. Private and public EVs’ demand is considered through five main scenarios, which differ in the number of EVs and the charging strategies used (i.e., upon-arrival charging or smart charging). The analysis is illustrated using the Chilean power grid. The numerical results show that a massive penetration of EVs in the Chilean power generation system will heavily encourage solar power capacity investments. Furthermore, smart charging allows for an additional increase in the solar power installed, leading (in the Chilean case) to an extra 2.4% increase in solar power generation and an additional 2.5% decrease in fossil fuel-based generation, which was commonly used to offer flexibility to the system. These effects are diminished if a high-enough level of solar power is not feasible. In addition, some sensitivity analyses are made in order to identify the specific influences of some of the model parameters.}

abstract = {Sustainability goals include the utilization of renewable energy resources to supply the energy needs in addition to wastewater treatment to satisfy the water demand. Moreover, hydrogen has become a promising energy carrier and green fuel to decarbonize the industrial and transportation sectors. In this context, this research investigates a wind-photovoltaic power plant to produce green hydrogen for hydrogen refueling station and to operate an electrocoagulation water treatment unit in Ostrava, Czech Republic's northeast region. The study conducts a techno-economic analysis through HOMER Pro® software for optimal sizing of the power station components and to investigate the economic indices of the plant. The power station employs photovoltaic panels and wind turbines to supply the required electricity for electrolyzers and electrocoagulation reactors. As an off-grid system, lead acid batteries are utilized to store the surplus electricity. Wind speed and solar irradiation are the key role site dependent parameters that determine the cost of hydrogen, electricity, and wastewater treatment. The simulated model considers the capital, operating, and replacement costs for system components. In the proposed system, 240 kg of hydrogen as well as 720 kWh electrical energy are daily required for the hydrogen refueling station and the electrocoagulation unit, respectively. Accordingly, the power station annually generates 6,997,990 kWh of electrical energy in addition to 85595 kg of green hydrogen. Based on the economic analysis, the project's NPC is determined to be €5.49 M and the levelized cost of Hydrogen (LCH) is 2.89 €/kg excluding compressor unit costs. This value proves the effectiveness of this power system, which encourages the utilization of green hydrogen for fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCVs). Furthermore, emerging electrocoagulation studies produce hydrogen through wastewater treatment, increasing hydrogen production and lowering LCH. Therefore, this study is able to provide practicable methodology support for optimal sizing of the power station components, which is beneficial for industrialization and economic development as well as transition toward sustainability and autonomous energy systems.}
