Title = {Optimal Sizing and Locations of Fast Charging Stations for Electric
   Vehicles Considering Power System Constraints},

Abstract = {With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles, it becomes crucial to
   ensure that Fast Charging Stations (FCSs) are strategically located and
   adequately sized to establish a dependable and accessible charging
   infrastructure. This study investigates the critical issue of optimizing
   the size and location of these stations, considering total costs,
   including investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, cost of
   power system loss, and power system reliability costs. To address this
   challenge, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a powerful optimization
   technique, is employed to identify the optimal sizes and locations of
   FCSs. The PSO enables the consideration of complex relationships among
   variables such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) demand, station capacity, and
   power system limitations. From the perspective of the Transmission
   System Operator (TSO), the impact of FCSs on power system reliability
   has been evaluated using an Energy Not Supplied (ENS) index to evaluate
   power system reliability costs. Simulation results on the 193-bus test
   system in northeastern Thailand, conducted with Power Factory DIgSILENT
   software, validate the effectiveness of our proposed model and method.
   The results demonstrate that our approach not only identifies the
   optimal placement and size of FCSs with minimal overall costs but also
   ensures the operational security of the power system. The proposed
   method can solve the problem rapidly and accurately. Additionally, power
   system reliability is considered a criterion in the proposed method.},

Title = {The impact of PHEVs charging and network topology optimization on bulk
   power system reliability},

Abstract = {Exhausting fossil fuels and increasing environmental pollutions call for
   the wider deployment of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which
   enable the interactions of transportation and electric sectors. The
   extra loads for charging massive PHEVs could compromise the power system
   reliability and impose considerable stress on the power system.
   Transmission line congestions and generation capacity inadequacy could
   be caused under this circumstance. However, there is little literature
   which comprehensively studies the impact of large-scale PHEVs on the
   bulk power system reliability when smart grid technologies are
   incorporated including smart charging and flexible transmission topology
   control technologies. This work studies the impacts of different
   charging strategies and transmission network operation strategies on the
   bulk power system reliability with high PHEVs integration. An evolution
   strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is applied to
   optimize the charging load of PHEVs and shave the peak load. A network
   topology optimization (NTO) operation strategy is employed to lessen the
   transmission congestions and reduce the load curtailment. Based on the
   sequential Monte Carlo simulation method, these technologies are
   integrated into the reliability evaluation process. Numerical studies
   and sensitivity analysis are conducted on modified IEEE RTS-79 systems.
   The results verify the effectiveness of the technologies to realize the
   potential of existing power system infrastructures so as to relieve the
   stress caused by the PHEVs load, increase the available penetration of
   PHEVs and promote the bulk power system reliability which is meaningful
   for power system planning and risk management.},

Abstract = {Environmental concerns with gasoline vehicles have led to increased
   attention to electric vehicles in recent years. Plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles (PHEV) use both electricity and gasoline to propel the vehicle,
   and is being recognized as a potential alternative to conventional
   vehicles. PHEVs offer opportunity to use electric energy generated by
   renewable resources and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
   The electric energy requirement of PHEV can, however, cause negative
   impacts on the power system reliability, especially when the size of a
   PHEV fleet is relatively large. This paper presents the development of a
   probabilistic model considering the driving distance, charging times,
   charging locations, battery state of charge, and charging requirements
   of a PHEV. A methodology using hybrid analytical and Monte Carlo
   simulation approach is presented to evaluate the reliability of a power
   system integrated with PHEVs, considering the important PHEV
   characteristics, charging scenarios, and power system parameters.
   Studies are presented on the IEEE-reliability test system to illustrate
   the impact of PHEV penetration in a power system. Based on the study
   results, the methods of augmenting system reliability through controlled

Abstract = {As electric vehicles gain popularity, consumers increasingly adopt them
   as an alternative to traditional internal combustion engine-driven
   vehicles. Electric vehicle chargers integrate with distribution networks
   via power electronic interfaces, offering significant control and
   operational flexibility. The industry is quickly adapting to this
   rapidly emerging load type, and now requires a robust means for
   understanding their impact on power system operations. This paper
   presents a modeling approach to capture the aggregate dynamic impact of
   these chargers on the power system in response to a range of network
   fault conditions. Six commonly available electric vehicles were
   empirically tested under various supply disturbances using a grid
   simulator, and their fault ride-through performances have been
   characterised. The undervoltage withstand capability of the six vehicles
   varied considerably, with fault voltage thresholds ranging between 0.3
   and 0.7 pu leading to electric vehicles either ceasing charging for
   between similar to 2 and 10 seconds, or locking out completely. A
   composite dynamic load model for electric vehicles was developed and
   validated, employing the collected empirical data. The validation
   process demonstrated the aggregate load model's capability to accurately
   capture the resulting load deficit owing to electric vehicle fault
   ride-through in response to transmission-level faults. The proposed
   model is suitable for application in wide-area power system studies to
   enhance the accuracy of simulated network load response for frequency
   assessments, operations planning, and other system analyses.},

Abstract = {The large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is regarded as an
   effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the
   transportation sector. Although EVs do not produce tailpipe emissions,
   their widespread adoption may impose significant pressure on the
   decarbonization of the power system-a critical aspect often overlooked
   in planning and policy-making. Moreover, the actual environmental
   benefits of EVs depend on the source of electricity used for charging.
   Considering the power demand induced by EV charging, we develop a
   continuous-time dynamic model for the optimal planning of simultaneous
   EV adoption and the integration of renewable energy sources into the
   power system. The interactions between competing entities, such as EVs
   versus legacy vehicles, and renewable versus conventional energy
   sources, are incorporated into our mathematical model based on the
   Lotka-Volterra equations. We formulate an optimal control problem to
   determine planning policies for EV subsidies, infrastructure investment,
   and the rates of renewable integration and fossil fuel retirement. The
   goal is to achieve a desired EV market penetration rate (MPR) while
   enabling the smooth integration of renewables. The nonlinear optimal
   control problem is solved using the Pontryagin minimum principle.
   Comprehensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach, including sensitivity analyses
   on MPR targets, planning horizons, and cost-benefit considerations. The
   results offer useful insights for policymakers in designing long-term
   strategies for EV adoption within a coupled traffic-power system.},

   Considering Power Distribution and Transportation Integrated System},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {83427-83438},
Abstract = {The increase in EV (Electric Vehicle) charging demands significantly
   affects the power system; thus, developing an optimal operating system
   is necessary to improve the power system stability while considering the
   transportation network. However, in existing studies, charging
   scheduling is divided into a power system perspective focusing on grid
   stability and a transportation perspective focusing on the optimal
   operation of EVs. As EVs affect both systems, it is necessary to
   consider both grid operation and transportation-network operation
   simultaneously. In this study, an integrated operation algorithm for the
   transportation network and power grid has been developed, which
   determines the amount of demand response through the power-flow results
   at the upper level and resolves traffic congestion by setting the
   optimal route for EVs at the lower level. The Demand Response (DR)
   adjustment amount is determined based on MATSim vehicle data, rather
   than simply looking at the DR amount from the perspective of the power
   system. Furthermore, the concept of Autonomous Integrated EVs (AIEV) in
   the integrated system has been constructed, which improves the grid
   stability to cope with uncooperative EVs. The transportation system is
   configured using MATSim to run the integrated simulation, and the power
   system is configured using the IEEE-33 bus model. The integrated
   operating algorithm received high evaluation indicators for voltage
   stability, power loss, and average driving time. In addition, the
   effectiveness of the algorithm was demonstrated in various situations
   through the composition of multiple scenarios.},

Abstract = {To effectively promote renewable energy development and reduce carbon

   sources (RES), energy storage (ES) technology, and electric vehicles

Abstract = {This paper assesses the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) providing
   primary frequency regulation via vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. The
   aim of the work is to define a set of recommendations in order to
   guarantee a stable large-scale deployment of EV fleets as primary
   reserve providers. A realistic fleet model is proposed, which emulates
   the aggregated response of a number of EVs characterized by V2G hardware
   response times derived in laboratory tests. The effects of primary
   frequency control via EV fleets replacing conventional generating units
   are assessed with a sensitivity study in a single-bus power system with
   growing fleet sizes and response times. Two recommendations are derived
   to guarantee safe and stable operation: Recommendation 1 requires the
   share of EVs providing primary reserve to be smaller than the reserve
   from conventional units; Recommendation 2 requires response times below
   a given limit value, calculated as a function of the following power
   system parameters: the system inertia, the total primary reserve over
   the rotating generation capacity, and the employed droop gain. The full
   60 kV power system of the Danish island of Bornholm is then employed to
   evaluate the validity of the proposed requirements on a real system with

Abstract = {The need for Enhanced Frequency Response (EFR) is expected to increase

   way to provide EFR is to use power electronic compensators (PECs) for

   technology in future GB power system by quantifying the total EFR
   obtainable through deploying PVC in the urban domestic sector, the
   investment cost of the installment and the economic and environmental
   benefits of using PVC. The quantification is based on a stochastic
   domestic demand model and generic medium and low-voltage distribution
   networks for the urban areas of GB and a stochastic unit commitment
   (SUC) model with constraints for secure post-fault frequency evolution
   is used for the value assessment. Two future energy scenarios in the

Abstract = {During the power system restoration there is a high possibility that the
   load demand is greater than the normal system operation for thermostatic
   loads. This demand increment, called Cold Load Pick-up (CLPU) has been a
   critical concern to utilities and will slow down the restoration
   process. Thus, it is imperative to predict the CLPU demand to perform
   restoration process more precisely. The use of new loads such as
   electric vehicles (EVs) has made new problems. In this paper, first the
   negative impact of EVs after an outage, on CLPU demand is investigated
   and then it is shown that the behavior of EVs during restoration service
   is the same as CLPU phenomenon. In doing so, the proposed approach uses
   Monte Carlo simulation method to predict EVs recharging demand. Since
   there will be some other new loads in the future that may have CLPU
   performance, a new approach is proposed to predict the CLPU demand of
   any load, without the need to have its exact model. ANFIS method is used
   to estimate CLPU demand based on previous outage cases in the feeder.
   The proposed approach is implemented in MATLAB(R) and simulation results
   confirm its ability in load prediction for restoration service.},

   The challenge lies in the inherent intermittency associated with solar
   generation and the uncertainty introduced by the charging load of EVs on
   the demand side of power grids. Therefore, it is indispensable from the
   perspective of power system operation and planning to consider the
   uncertainties associated with the output power of these resources in the
   reliability assessment framework. This paper develops an electric
   vehicle load model considering diverse charging station locations, EV
   types, and drivers' behavior. Also, the proposed method integrates the
   uncertainty of PV generation through interval prediction utilizing the
   K-Nearest Neighbors regressor. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation is
   used to analyze the impact of PV interval (forecasted lower and upper
   generation profile), EV load (hourly and peak), line failures, and
   demographic characteristics associated with EV on power system
   reliability. The reliability assessment is extended to sensitivity
   analysis and evaluation of the impact of EV loads and PV generation
   profiles on the capacity value of PV generators with different
   capacities, utilizing the Discrete Convolution approach. The proposed
   approach is demonstrated on the IEEE Reliability Test System and the
   results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in determining
   the reliability of the power system by explicitly accommodating PV
   uncertainties and the intricacies of EVs.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Pages = {63905-63914},
Abstract = {The project Carbon-Free Island Jeju by 2030 promoted by the Republic of
   Korea aims to expand the renewable energy sources centered on wind power
   in Jeju Island and supply electric vehicles for eco-friendly mobility.
   However, the increased penetration rate of electric vehicles and
   expansion of variable renewable energy sources can accelerate the power
   demand and uncertainty in the power generation output. In this paper,
   power system analysis is performed through electric vehicle charging
   demand and wind power outputs prediction, and an electric vehicle
   charging decentralization algorithm is proposed to mitigate system
   congestion. In order to predict electric vehicle charging demand, the
   measurement data were analyzed, and random sampling was performed by
   applying the weight of charging frequency for each season and time. In
   addition, wind power outputs prediction was performed using the ARIMAX
   model. Input variables are wind power measurement data and additional
   explanatory variables (wind speed). Wind power outputs prediction error
   (absolute average error) is about 9.6\%, which means that the prediction
   accuracy of the proposed algorithm is high. A practical power system
   analysis was performed for the scenario in which electric vehicle
   charging is expected to be higher than the wind power generation due to
   the concentration of electric vehicle charging. The proposed algorithm
   can be used to analyze power system problems that may occur due to the
   concentration of electric vehicle charging demand in the future, and to
   prepare a method for decentralizing electric vehicle charging demand to
   establish a stable power system operation plan.},

Title = {Integrating Electric Vehicles into Power System Operation Production
   Cost Models},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},

Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The electrification of the transportation sector will increase the
   demand for electric power, potentially impacting the peak load and power
   system operations. A change such as this will be multifaceted. A power
   system production cost model (PCM) is a useful tool with which to
   analyze one of these facets, the operation of the power system. A PCM is
   a computer simulation that mimics power system operation, i.e., unit
   commitment, economic dispatch, reserves, etc. To understand how electric
   vehicles (EVs) will affect power system operation, it is necessary to
   create models that describe how EVs interact with power system
   operations that are suitable for use in a PCM. In this work, EV charging
   data from the EV Project, reported by the Idaho National Laboratory,
   were used to create scalable, statistical models of EV charging load
   profiles suitable for incorporation into a PCM. Models of EV loads were
   created for uncoordinated and coordinated charging. Uncoordinated
   charging load represents the load resulting from EV owners that charge
   at times of their choosing. To create an uncoordinated charging load
   profile, the parameters of importance are the number of vehicles,
   charger type, battery capacity, availability for charging, and battery
   beginning and ending states of charge. Coordinated charging is where EVs
   are charged via an ``aggregator{''} that interacts with a power system
   operator to schedule EV charging at times that either minimize system
   operating costs, decrease EV charging costs, or both, while meeting the
   daily EV charging requirements subject to the EV owners' charging
   constraints. Beta distributions were found to be the most appropriate
   distribution for statistically modeling the initial and final state of
   charge (SoC) of vehicles in an EV fleet. A Monte Carlo technique was
   implemented by sampling the charging parameters of importance to create
   an uncoordinated charging load time series. Coordinated charging was
   modeled as a controllable load within the PCM to represent the influence
   of the EV fleet on the system's electricity price. The charging models
   were integrated as EV loads in a simple 5-bus system to demonstrate
   their usefulness. Polaris Systems Optimization's PCM power system
   optimizer (PSO) was employed to show the effect of the EVs on one day of
   operation in the 5-bus power system, yielding interesting and valid
   results and showing the effectiveness of the charging models.},

Pages = {3365-3375},

Abstract = {The continuous increase of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to
   introduce several challenges to power systems among which is the
   deteriorating reliability of power supply. This paper proposes two
   adequacy metrics to quantify the maximum permissible EV loads for a
   power system without deteriorating its reliability and the required
   improvements to power systems to accommodate high penetrations of EVs,
   which are defined as follows: 1) extra effective available energy for
   EVs' charging (EEAE-EVs) and 2) extra effective required generation to
   accommodate EVs (EERG-EVs). The EEAE-EVs provides a measure for the
   maximum amount of EV loads that a power system can accommodate without
   adding new generation while maintaining its reliability. The EERG-EVs
   provides a measure to the minimum amount of new generation that is
   needed to restore the reliability level of a power system if the load of
   EVs exceeds the maximum permissible load of the system. These metrics
   provide a decision aid to power system planners and operators on when
   and how to perform generation expansion. The importance of the proposed
   metrics is demonstrated on the IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE RTS)
   with real EV charging data. The sequential Monte Carlo simulation method
   is used in evaluating the well known power system reliability indices,
   the EEAE-EVs, and the EERG-EVs. The results show that a power system can
   accommodate EV loads without deteriorating its reliability as long as EV
   loads do not exceed the EEAE-EVs of the system. For the IEEERTS, the
   EERG-EVs shows that the amount of the required generation to maintain
   system reliability is about half of the added EV loads from 330-660 MW.},

Abstract = {The diffusion of electric vehicles is fundamental for transport sector
   decarbonization. However, a major concern about electric vehicles is
   their compatibility with power grids. Adopting a whole-power-system
   approach, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the impacts and
   benefits of electric vehicles' diffusion on a national power system,
   i.e., Italy. Demand and flexibility profiles are estimated with a
   detailed review of the literature on the topic, allowing us to put
   forward reliable charging profiles and the resulting flexibility,
   compatible with the Italian regulatory framework. Distribution network
   planning and power system dispatching are handled with dedicated models,
   while the uncertainty associated with EV charging behavior is managed
   with a Monte Carlo approach. The novelty of this study is considering a
   nationwide context, considering both transmission and distribution
   systems, and proposing a set of policies suitable for enabling
   flexibility provision. The results show that the power and energy demand
   created by the spread of EVs will have localized impacts on power and
   voltage limits of the distribution network, while the consequences for
   transmission grids and dispatching will be negligible. In 2030
   scenarios, smart charging reduces grid elements' violations (-23\%,
   -100\%), dispatching costs (-43\%), and RES curtailment (-50\%).},

Abstract = {The high penetration of variable renewable energies requires the
   flexibility from both the generation and demand sides. This raises the
   necessity of modeling stochastic and flexible energy resources in power
   system operation. However, some distributed energy resources have both
   stochasticity and flexibility, e.g., prosumers with distributed
   photovoltaics and energy storage, and plug-in electric vehicles with
   stochastic charging behavior and demand response capability. Such partly
   controllable participants pose challenges to modeling the aggregate
   behavior of large numbers of entities in power system operation. This
   paper proposes a new perspective on the aggregate modeling of such
   energy resources in power system operation. Specifically, a unified
   controllability-uncontrollability-decomposed model for various energy
   resources is established by modeling the controllable and uncontrollable
   parts of energy resources separately. Such decomposition enables the
   straightforward aggregate modeling of massive energy resources with
   different controllabilities by integrating their controllable components
   with linking constraints and uncontrollable components with dependent
   discrete convolution. Furthermore, a two-stage stochastic unit
   commitment model based on the proposed model for power system operation
   is established. The proposed model is tested using a three-bus system
   and real Qinghai provincial power grid of China. The result shows that
   this model is able to characterize at high accuracy the aggregate
   behavior of massive energy resources with different levels of
   controllability so that their flexibility can be fully explored.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, the increasing frequency and severity of extreme
   weather events (EWEs) have posed a growing threat to power system
   resilience. The existing literature has examined the impact of extreme
   events on power system planning. However, few studies have
   systematically explored the role of large-scale electric vehicle (EV)
   fleets toward grid resilience enhancement in EWEs. Therefore, we propose
   a resilience-oriented power system planning method considering
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G) coordination, especially amidst blizzard events. A
   blizzard-induced grid failure model is established for long-term N-K
   contingency scenario generation, followed by a two-stage generation
   expansion and line hardening optimization considering both normal and
   contingency conditions. Three charging modes of EV fleets, i.e., plug
   and play (PnP), orderly charging (V1G) and V2G, are compared. Case
   studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, using 2024 data from the Jibei
   region of northern China and two extreme blizzard scenarios, demonstrate
   that combining resilience-oriented planning with V2G coordination
   significantly reduces total system costs by 58.02\% compared to the
   baseline, achieving the lowest total cost of \$2.48 x 103 million.
   Furthermore, the integrated approach reduces load shedding cost by
   87.74\% and 77.95\% compared to considering only EV coordination or only
   resilience planning, respectively. These findings highlight the value
   and novelty of integrating EV flexibility into long-term
   resilience-oriented power system planning.},

   Challenges and Solutions},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 9},
Abstract = {India has transitioned from being an energy-deficient nation to an
   energy-surplus nation. As of July 2023, India's power system has seen a
   rapid transformation, with renewable energy, including large hydro,
   accounting for 40\% of the total installed capacity at 177 GW. The
   ongoing energy transition has not only changed the country's energy mix
   but also brought new challenges for system operators. The primary
   challenge is frequency instability due to the reduction of system
   inertia and governor-based primary frequency response (PFR) availability
   by large-scale integration of uncertain renewable energy resources (RES)
   such as wind and solar photovoltaic generators. Furthermore, the absence
   of frequency control ancillary services market, inadequate penetration
   of electric vehicles (EVs) and uncertainty of RES generation enhance the
   complexity of the frequency response services in the Indian power
   system. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of
   the frequency response challenges of the future low-carbon Indian power
   system and underlines the new potential fast frequency response (FFR)
   services from advanced energy storage and renewable generation
   technologies. Such FFR services can be swiftly deployed in low-inertia
   grids through the integration of energy storage systems and
   inverter-based resources in a shorter span. Modeling of FFR services in
   security constraint unit commitment (SCUC) can enhance grid resiliency
   and facilitate high penetration of RES in the Indian power system
   without loss of frequency stability.},

Abstract = {The power system is becoming increasingly complex due to the rise of
   Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs), making it
   more challenging to maintain supply-demand balance. Relying on day-ahead
   power market planning has limitations in addressing the volatility
   caused by RESs, resulting in unnecessary reserve capacity consumption.
   The optimal utilization of flexible resources, including Energy Storage
   Systems (ESSs), is crucial to tackle these issues. Economic Dispatch
   (ED) plays a vital role in power system operation and planning, which
   has become even more significant with the growth of RESs and the
   widespread adoption of EVs. It introduces dynamic loads due to varying
   user behaviors, posing operational challenges for the power system. The
   integration of EVs into the grid through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)
   technology is becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a
   comprehensive solution for day-ahead and real-time application,
   considering the interconnection between EVs and RESs. It presents
   methods utilizing V2G to minimize operational costs in power systems.},

   case study of Norwegian energy communities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper investigates sector coupling between the central power system
   and local energy communities, including heat supply for buildings and
   charging of electric vehicles. We propose a stochastic linear
   programming framework to study long-term investments under uncertain
   short-term operations of nationally aggregated assets. We apply the
   model to a case study assuming European power sector decarbonization
   towards 2060 according to a 1.5 degree scenario, and we investigate the
   impact of coupling building heat systems and electric vehicle charging
   in Norway with the European power market. The case study focuses on the
   role of Norway in a European perspective because: (1) Norwegian
   electricity production is mainly based on flexible and renewable
   hydropower, (2) Norwegian building heating systems are currently mainly
   electric, and (3) Norway is already introducing electric vehicles at
   large. We focus on the European power market to test our hypothesis that
   it is more cost-efficient to decarbonize when the central power system
   is coordinated with building heat systems and electric vehicle charging.
   For Europe as a whole, results show that the average European
   electricity cost reduces by 3\% and transmission expansion decreases by
   0.4\% when Norwegian heat systems are developed in coordination with the
   European power system. The average Norwegian electricity cost decreases
   by 19\%. The strategy includes supplying up to 20\% of Norwegian
   buildings with district heating fueled by waste and biomass, and the
   remaining electric heating supply is dominated by heat pumps.},

Abstract = {In order to protect the marine environment, the fuel cell has become a
   good candidate for the main energy source of marine vehicles due to its
   remarkable performance of high efficiency, quietness, and cleanness.
   However, the fuel cell of the hybrid power system has a critical

   energy management strategy considering power sources degradation becomes
   significant and urgent. In addition, the power system configuration has
   a strong link with the control strategy. In this vein, a sizing method
   of the hybrid energy storage system for a fuel cell hybrid excursion
   ferry is proposed to prolong the fuel cell lifetime. Based on the
   configuration of the power system, a real-time optimization control
   strategy considering efficiency and durability is developed. To verify
   the control strategy, the mathematical model of the hybrid power system
   is established. Compared with the wavelet-based control strategy and

Title = {Optimal scheduling of distributed battery storage for enhancing the

   constraints},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {152-159},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper, the sustainable day-ahead scheduling of electric power
   systems with the integration of distributed energy storage devices is
   investigated. The main objective is to minimize the hourly power system
   operation cost with a cleaner, socially responsible, and sustainable
   generation of electricity. Emission constraints are enforced to reduce
   the carbon footprint of conventional thermal generating units. The
   stationary electric vehicles (EV) are considered as an example of
   distributed storage and vehicle to grid (V2G) technology is considered
   to demonstrate the bilateral role of EV as supplier and consumer of
   energy. Battery storage can ease the impact of variability of renewable
   energy sources on power system operations and reduce the impact of
   thermal generation emission at peak hours. We model the day-ahead
   scheduling of electric power systems as a mixed-integer linear
   programing (MILP) problem for solving the hourly security-constraint
   unit commitment (SCUC). In order to expedite the real-time solution for
   large-scale power systems, we consider a two-stage model of the hourly
   SCUC by applying the Benders decomposition (BD). The Benders
   decomposition would separate the hourly generation unit commitment (UC)
   in the master problem from the power network security check in
   subproblem. The subproblem would check dc network security constraints
   for the given UC solution to determine whether a converged and secure dc
   power flow can be obtained. If any power network violations arise,
   corresponding Benders cuts are formed and added to the master problem
   for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will
   continue until the network violations are eliminated and a converged
   hourly solution is found for scheduling the power generating units.
   Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed MILP approach and its potentials as an optimization tool
   for sustainable operations of electric power grids. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {Increasing variability and uncertainty coming from both sides of the
   power system equilibrium equation, such as wind energy on the generation
   side and increasing share of new consumers such as electric vehicles on
   the demand side, entail higher reserve requirements. While traditional
   approaches of assigning conventional generation units to maintain system
   stability can increase operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, or
   give signals for new investments, utilizing intelligent control of
   distributed sources might mitigate those negative effects. This can he
   achieved by controllable charging of domestic electric vehicles. On the
   other hand, increasing number of public charging stations gives final
   users the opportunity to fast charge, making their vehicles an
   additional source of uncertainty rather than a provider of flexibility.
   This paper brings a full system assessment of combined effect of slow
   home charging of electric vehicles together with fast charging stations
   (both with and without integrated energy storage systems), cast as mixed
   integer linear programming unit commitment model. The contributions of
   this paper look into optimal periods when fast charging is beneficial
   for the system operation, as well as assess the benefits of integrating

Pages = {104542-104554},
Abstract = {With the increasing proliferation of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power
   globally, frequency regulation by balancing generation and load in power
   systems is becoming increasingly difficult owing to reductions in
   dispatchable power and inertia. One countermeasure is autonomous load
   control, in which thermostatic loads and electric vehicle chargers
   quickly adjust the power consumption based on the grid frequency
   monitored by themselves without communication. However, testing the
   impact of such load controls on the frequency in actual power systems is
   too expensive. Therefore, a laboratory-scale isolated power system was
   prepared as a test bed to examine autonomous load control based on the
   rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and the frequency deviation to cope
   with steep frequency fluctuations. Moreover, the experimental system was
   simulated numerically using MATLAB/Simulink. The experimental and
   simulation results are comparable, indicating that the simulation can be
   used to determine the total capacity and threshold when planning the
   introduction of autonomous control loads. The experimental and
   simulation results also show that frequency fluctuations can be
   mitigated by introducing autonomous control loads to the grid, and the
   response time can be improved by approximately 1 s by controlling the
   load based on the RoCoF.},

Title = {Reliability Analysis and Economic Prospect of Wind Energy Sources
   Incorporated Microgrid System for Smart Buildings Environment},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {62013-62027},
Abstract = {This work deals with assessing the reliability of wind energy sources
   incorporated into a microgrid system to increase grid stability. As the
   share of power generated from wind energy continues to increase due to
   environmental concerns and to reduce carbon footprints, the case study
   proposed is designing an effective wind energy system for a smart
   building environment to reduce the burden on the grid. Incorporating
   wind energy systems into grid-connected buildings increases the
   reliability of the microgrid system for smart building environments.
   Applying smart techniques with integrated automation in the built
   environment can play a key role in decreasing peak demand for load
   development in smart cities. This can also enhance the overall
   efficiency of power grids, reduce waste, and enable the effective use of
   energy resources. Furthermore, researchers are finding new ways to
   collect energy from renewable sources and power-built environments due
   to dwindling fossil fuel resources and increased environmental
   awareness. The analysis of wind-connected power systems has been
   initiated to satisfy the increasing demand for reliable supply systems
   by consumers. This has prompted the use of wind energy systems with
   controlled techniques to enhance the reliability of power systems and
   reduce carbon footprints generated by fossil fuel-based power systems.
   Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to understand the economic
   prospects of wind energy sources for smart building environments,
   reliability analysis of wind energy sources-based power systems, reduce
   carbon footprints, and balance power demand through wind energy systems.
   The Progressive Wind Model Taylor-Sequence Proliferation (PWMTSP) and
   Innovative Six Parameters Based Progressive Beta Creative Model
   (ISPBPBCM) approaches are proposed to understand the reliability of wind
   energy-based power systems in smart building environments. The work also
   provides an economic analysis of the proposed low-cost wind power system
   with different capacities for residential consumers in selected
   geographic location. Eight cases are considered for the proposed
   effective wind energy system for smart building environments ranging
   from 2 MW to 32 MW. Hence, the economic analysis of the proposed systems
   is discussed for residential users. All eight cases are eco-friendly and
   reduce carbon emissions as these generated units from wind energy
   sources need not be purchased from fossil fuel-based plants, which
   increases the reliability of the proposed system. The expected energy
   not supplied (EENS) in the planned work increases as wind power capacity
   increases. Loss of load expectation (LOLE), loss of load probability
   (LOLP), and failure rate all decrease with the installation of more wind
   power systems. Moreover, it can be seen that mean time to repair (MTTR)
   improves when wind energy capacity rises incrementally from 2 MW to 32
   MW. The proposed progressive wind model Taylor-sequence proliferation
   (PWMTSP) improves MTTR while increasing the wind power capacity from 4.8
   to 13.8. The value of MTTR rises from 5.2 to 14.7 with the novel six
   parameter progressive beta creative model (ISPBPBCM). The proposed
   method is anticipated to be adaptable to various types of wind energy
   systems where dependability is a crucial component of system design and
   scalable to large wind integrated power systems.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of electric vehicles and active distribution network
   has brought many uncertainties to the power system. If the power system
   involves battery-swap stations of electric vehicles, it is difficult to
   ensure the data security during the distributed scheduling. To solve the
   problem, this paper sets up a collaborative optimization model for
   distributed scheduling based on blockchain consensus mechanism,
   considering the battery-swap stations. The power system was divided into
   three levels: the transmission network level, the distribution network
   level and the battery-swap station level. Next, the objective functions
   were constructed to minimize the generation cost and daily load variance
   on each level, and the optimal scheduling plan for the power system was
   solved through multi-level collaborative optimization. The blockchain
   consensus mechanism was adopted to verify the accuracy of the
   transaction data, and the production data of all entities were encoded

   reduce the generation cost, lower the daily load variance, and enhance

Title = {Optimizing Power System Reliability and Carbon Emissions With a Fuzzy

   Errors, EV Charging, and Energy Storage System},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {164412-164426},
Abstract = {The increasing use of Renewable Energy (RE), the influence of forecasted
   load error, and Electric Vehicles (EVs) add significant uncertainty and
   variables to power system Unit Commitment (UC) planning. For addressing
   this challenge, this paper proposes a Fuzzy Mathematical Mixed-Integer
   Linear Programming (FMMILP) approach for daily UC that incorporates the
   scheduling of Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) and Battery Energy Storage
   (BES) to manage supply and demand fluctuations. The FMMILP model
   explicitly considers these uncertainties and aims to minimize total
   production cost and carbon emissions while ensuring reliable and
   sustainable power system operation. The effective solution method for
   solving FMMILP is explained. The FMMILP model is applied to Thailand's
   national power system, characterized by its diverse generation mix,
   substantial RES penetration, and growing EV adoption. A comprehensive
   stochastic reliability analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation is
   performed, incorporating a wide range of supply and demand scenarios,
   including extreme worst-case scenarios, to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the proposed models. These scenarios incorporate optimal solutions from
   UC and RES dispatch patterns. Three distinct FMMILP models are compared
   against a deterministic UC benchmark in the rainy, summer, and winter
   seasons. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the FMMILP model
   achieves optimal solutions within acceptable computational time and
   significantly enhances system reliability compared to the deterministic
   model, with reliability improvements of 15.99\%, 26.14\%, and 51.44\% in
   the rainy season, summer season, and winter season, respectively. This
   is evidenced by the reduction in the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and
   Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) in power system operation.},

Abstract = {Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is a well-established field in

Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {One of the most important problems in the widespread use of electric
   vehicles is the lack of charging infrastructure. Especially in tourist
   areas where historical buildings are located, the installation of a
   power grid for the installation of electric vehicle charging stations or
   generating electrical energy by installing renewable energy production
   systems such as large-sized PV (photovoltaic) and wind turbines poses a
   problem because it causes the deterioration of the historical texture.
   Considering the need for renewable energy sources in the transportation
   sector, our aim in this study is to model an electric vehicle charging
   station using PVPS (photovoltaic power system) and FC (fuel cell) power
   systems by using irradiation and temperature data from historical
   regions. This designed charging station model performs electric vehicle
   charging, meeting the energy demand of a house and hydrogen production
   by feeding the electrolyzer with the surplus energy from producing
   electrical energy with the PVPS during the daytime. At night, when there
   is no solar radiation, electric vehicle charging and residential energy
   demand are met with an FC power system. One of the most important
   advantages of this system is the use of hydrogen storage instead of a
   battery system for energy storage and the conversion of hydrogen into
   electrical energy with an FC. Unlike other studies, in our study, fossil
   energy sources such as diesel generators are not included for the stable
   operation of the system. The system in this study may need hydrogen
   refueling in unfavorable climatic conditions and the energy storage
   capacity is limited by the hydrogen fuel tank capacity.},

Title = {Analyzing Electric Vehicle Load Impact on Power Systems: Modeling
   Analysis and a Case Study for Maldives},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {125640-125657},
Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) can have massive benefits in energy sector
   especially for a small island country like the Maldives that imports oil
   with high transportation costs while power could have been generated
   from abundantly available local renewable resources. However, EV
   charging may also impose significant investment requirement for the
   power system that needs to be analyzed carefully including the capacity
   of the existing distribution network system, investments needed in solar
   PV together with battery storage and additional diesel capacity to meet
   the incremental demand from EVs. We explore an EV adoption scenario for
   Maldives for 2030 with 30\% of all vehicles including two-wheelers that
   dominate the transport on the island under two different charging
   regimes: uncoordinated and optimized coordinated mode. The latter is
   achieved through a system wide optimization using a modified version of
   the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM) that optimizes charging
   load subject to a range of constraints on allowable timing for different
   categories of vehicles. If charging from the fleet is uncoordinated, a
   relatively small increase in energy requirement of 3.1\% due to EV may
   lead to a 26.1\% increase in generation capacity requirement and hence
   15.7\% additional investment. While the optimized charging regime helps
   to drastically cut down on generation capacity requirements to just
   1.8\% increase and also considerably eases feeder loading, it may also
   lead to higher emissions as more EV load during off-peak hours lead to
   an increase in diesel-based generation. We have therefore explored an
   additional scenario wherein the annual emissions from the power sector
   are constrained to the baseline ({''}No EV{''}) scenario. The analysis
   shows the importance of focused modeling analysis to understand the
   ramifications of EV load impact on the power system including
   significant increase in generation capacity and potential increase in
   power sector emissions in a fossil-fuel dominated system.},

Abstract = {The electric vehicles (EVs) can introduce new operation strategies, such

Abstract = {The propulsion system of a medium-voltage dc (MVDC) ship is subject to
   large thrust/torque variations due to interactions of the ship and the
   propeller with sea waves. These variations induce steep power
   fluctuations on the MVDC bus, adversely impacting the stability,
   efficiency and power quality. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is a
   promising solution for mitigating these power fluctuations. Dictating
   the energy that the HESS components must deliver/absorb, the energy
   management strategy (EMS) impacts the size/capacity of the energy
   storage system (ESS). Based on this consideration, sizing and EMS of a
   battery/supercapacitor (SC) HESS are jointly optimised by using a deep
   reinforcement learning-based method. The proposed method splits the
   power between the HESS components such that while the operational
   constraints are satisfied, energy storage size and losses are minimised.
   Its features are adaptability to varying sea states, real-time
   implementation feasibility, while obviating the requirement for
   knowledge of the ship propulsion power profile. The efficacy of the
   joint sizing/EMS on reducing the ESS size is validated by comparing the
   sizes when battery-only, SC-only and HESS are employed in the MVDC
   shipboard power system. Real-time implementation feasibility and
   adaptability to various ship propulsion power profiles is confirmed
   through real-time simulations.},

   In particular, three power markets-clearing algorithms with different

   is taken into account. The stochasticity of PV generation is also
   investigated by using a scenario-based approach related to daily solar

   also taken into consideration by implementing peak load limitation (PLL)

   current caused by the EVs. The proposed study accounts for various EV
   power levels, grid voltage levels, and EV modes of operation.
   Furthermore, an optimal frequency support strategy is developed that
   takes advantage of available EVs in V2G mode to improve the frequency
   stability of the grid in the event of frequency fluctuations. The
   effects of bidirectional EVs on the voltage profile is also explored by
   implementing current summation method (CSM)-derived power flow analysis
   for IEEE 33-Bus radial distribution system. The results show that with
   an optimal planning of EVs, it is possible to improve voltage profile
   and frequency stability of the grid while the power quality of the grid
   is maintained in the allowed range according to the IEEE 519-2014
   standard.},

Abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) is essential to reduce the emission caused by
   conventional vehicle. Placement of electric vehicle charging station
   (EVCS) is crucial to fulfilling the charging demand at different
   locations maintaining the minimum negative impact on the power system
   network. In this article, placement of EVCS has been planned in a radial
   distribution network superimposed with a road network. The weightage for
   different places have been considered as per charging demand which
   depends on the supermarket, road junctions, residences etc. The
   objectives are minimization of the energy loss, voltage deviation of the
   power system network and minimization of the land cost with maximum
   weightage to serve maximum EV with minimum establishment cost. The area
   has been divided into three zones to establish an EVCS at each zone to
   make it distributed. Uncertainties related to EV have been considered in
   this work using 2m Point Estimation method (2m PEM). The optimization
   problem has been solved using Differential Evolution (DE) and Harris
   Hawks Optimization (HHO) techniques. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Mitigating Downward Reserve Deficiency of Power System via Coordinating
   EV Demand Response at Valley Period},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {112368-112378},
Abstract = {The high penetration rate of electric vehicles (EVs) will have impacts
   on the operation of power system in the near future. One of the most
   significant impacts is the extreme load valley caused by
   ``consistency{''}in off-grid actions of EVs automatically finishing
   their charging, which normally occurs at night. The dramatic load
   reduction at limited period not only leads to security problem of power
   system due to the deficiency of downward reserve in generation side, but
   also forces the thermal units to operate in the extremely uneconomical
   deep peak regulation (DPR) state. To address this issue, a coordinated
   optimization strategy considering nighttime DPR state of units and
   uncertain EV demand response (DR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly,
   unlike traditional studies, a detailed unit commitment (UC) model
   considering life loss and oil cost is established in this paper. After
   that, on the basis of elastic pricing method and day-ahead contract,
   price-based demand response (PDR) and incentive-based demand response
   (IDR) model are proposed to avoid units operating in the DPR state. The
   uncertainty of both IDR and PDR progress are considered as a whole in
   the form of opportunity constrain, and then transformed into
   deterministic linear constraints for solving by adopting sequence
   operations. Finally, various cases are simulated in the improved IEEE
   30-bus system, the results indicate that the presented coordinated
   optimization strategy can reduce the units' operating cost effectively,
   as well as bring benefits to EV owners.},

Abstract = {With the increasing penetration of wind power and electric vehicle (EV)
   into the power system, system operators face new challenges for system
   reliability and generation cost due to the intermittent of wind power.
   Furthermore, the randomly connected EVs at different time periods and
   locations add more uncertainty to the power system. In this study,
   uncertainties in wind power generation and EV charging load are modelled
   into the day-ahead dynamic economic dispatch (DED) problem, solution
   feasibility and robustness are discussed, and the bad scenario set is
   formulated for the day-ahead DED problem. In the obtained model,
   parameters can be used to adjust the positive bias or conservative bias,
   charging/discharging power of battery switch stations are also
   controlled to optimise the total cost of power system. To solve the
   optimisation problem, the multi-agent bacterial colony chemotaxis
   algorithm and a mutation strategy based on the cloud theory are
   developed. The simulation results show that the proposed method is
   effective, and battery switching station can help to reduce total cost

Abstract = {In the given research, a new multicriterion (multiobjective)
   optimization algorithm has been considered to solve the problem of

   By considering the environmental and economic problems, the application

   focuses on multicriteria scheduling through uncertainty factors via

Title = {Dynamic investment planning of CVR implementation considering PEVs'

Abstract = {Conservation voltage reduction (CVR) is a strategy that tries to save
   energy consumption by managing consumers' voltage. On the other hand,
   enhancing reactive power compensation in the power system gives rise to
   CVR implementation more effectively. This paper addresses how the power
   system planner could encourage investment to establish the
   above-mentioned topics. Here, a model for encouraging industrial loads
   to dynamically invest in implementing the CVR strategy over the planning
   horizon is presented. To make CVR implementation more efficient,
   investment in upgrading plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) chargers to be
   utilized as reactive power compensators is also considered. Industrial
   loads benefit from saving in their electricity bills and incentive
   payments that might be paid by utilities (if necessary). The objective
   function of the proposed planning model is to maximize the energy-saving
   of industrial loads and to minimize incentive payment by electric
   utilities over the planning horizon. This objective is achieved subject
   to that the investment plan is economically feasible. Moreover, power
   system operation constraints in the planning horizon based on AC power
   flow equations and voltage-dependent load models are considered. The
   proposed planning problem is modelled as a non-linear optimization
   problem that can be solved by off-the-shelf software, for example, GAMS.
   The proposed model is applied to the Ontario transmission system. The
   numerical results show the proposed model's effectiveness in designing
   an investment plan for industrial loads to implement the CVR strategy
   and upgrade PEVs' chargers.

Volume = {13},
Pages = {4966-4983},
Abstract = {This work presents a review of open-source electric power transmission
   and distribution systems analysis tools suitable for use by industry
   professionals and academic researchers. Due to the high complexity of
   the electric grid, there exist numerous tools and extensive research
   pertaining to nearly every aspect of the design, operation, and control
   of transmission and distribution networks. In addition to the commercial
   tools, a wide range of free, open-source tools, models, and data usable
   by the scientific community for related research have been developed by
   different organizations, including both international and US
   universities and national laboratories. However, due to the absence of a
   catalog of available tools, models and data, researchers often lack a
   knowledge of existing capabilities and may develop duplicative software
   and tools. Increasing awareness of these available resources seeks to
   accelerate their broader use, leading to more efficient and standardized
   grid analysis. This review paper (which is part of a larger survey
   effort that studied over 400 tools in the transmission, distribution,
   buildings, and electric vehicles space) outlines selected open-source
   resources that have been developed in power transmission and

Abstract = {The rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) is strengthening the
   bi-directional interactions between electric power networks (EPNs) and
   transportation networks (TNs) while providing opportunities to enhance
   the resilience of power systems towards extreme events. To quantify the
   temporal and spatial flexibility of EVs for charging and discharging, a
   novel dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem is proposed. The DTA
   problem is based on a link transmission model (LTM) with extended
   charging links, depicting the interaction between EVs and power systems.
   It models the charging rates as continuous variables by an energy
   boundary model. To consider the evacuation requirements of TNs and the
   uncertainties of traffic conditions, the DTA problem is extended to a
   two-stage distributionally robust version. It is further incorporated
   into a two-stage distributionally robust unit commitment problem to
   balance the enhancement of EPNs and the performance of TNs. The problem
   is reformulated into a mixed-integer linear programming problem and
   solved by off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Case studies are performed
   on two test networks. The effectiveness is verified by the numerical
   results, e.g., reducing the load shedding amount without increasing the
   unmet traffic demand.},

Abstract = {Transmission congestion is one of major drawbacks of deregulated power
   system. Congestion gradually violates the physical, operational and
   policy constraints of the present electricity market. Congestion
   management in huge power system remains a challenging and tough task,
   which can be achieved by introducing one or more Distributed Energy
   Resources (DERs) such as Distributed Generation (DG), electric vehicles,
   modern micro grid, Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) etc. over congested
   lines. Consequently, this work proposes the hourly congestion management
   by optimal allocation of DG in `24 hours' time frame. Further,
   Transmission Congestion Rent is used to determine the optimal and sub
   optimal locations for DG, whereas Differential Evolution and Particle
   Swarm Optimization based hybrid optimization technique is exploited to
   identify optimal DG size. In this work, solar based DG along with
   battery based ESS is considered to act as Distributed Energy Storage
   System `DESS. Subsequently, Interval computation method is introduced in
   this work to consider the intermittency of solar DG. Battery Energy
   Storage System `BESS' is integrated with DGs due to its excess energy
   storage capability during off-load period and make it available at peak
   load conditions, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the
   network. The `24 hours' solar irradiance and temperature data of Delhi,
   India is taken into account to mathematically model the power generated
   from Solar DG. The proposed methodology is tested on IEEE 30-bus system
   and `24 hours' demand data is generated from the original IEEE load
   data. From the obtained results, it has been established that the hybrid
   optimization technique results into a better solution as compared to
   their individual enforcement in managing available generation resources

Abstract = {This study presents a flexible, reliable, and renewable power system
   resource planning approach to coordinate generation, transmission, and
   energy storage (ES) expansion planning in the presence of demand
   response (DR). The flexibility and reliability of the optimal resource
   expansion planning are ensured by means of appropriate constraints
   incorporated into the proposed planning tool where thermal generation
   units, ES systems, and DR programs are considered as flexibility
   resources. The proposed planning tool is a mixed-integer non-linear
   programming (MINLP) problem due to the non-linear and non-convex
   constraints of AC power flow equations. Accordingly, to linearise the
   proposed MINLP problem, the AC nodal power balance constraints are
   linearised by means of the first-order expansion of Taylor's series and
   the line flow equations are linearised by means of a polygon.
   Additionally, the stochastic programming is used to characterise the
   uncertainty of loads, a maximum available power of wind farms,
   forecasted energy price, and availability/unavailability of generation
   units and transmission lines by means of a sufficient number of
   scenarios. The proposed planning tool is implemented on the IEEE 6-bus
   and the IEEE 30-bus test systems under different conditions. Case
   studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {132},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this paper, the resilient-constrained generation and transmission
   expansion planning (RCGTEP) considering natural disasters such as
   earthquake and flood is presented. The proposed model contains a two
   objective problem that the first objective function minimizes the
   construction and operation costs of resiliency sources (RSs) and, in the
   second objective function, the minimization of the expected energy not
   supplied (EENS) due to the outage of the system against the mentioned
   natural disasters is formulated. Also, the proposed model is constrained
   to linearized AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equations, the planning and
   operating of RSs constraints such as generation units, hardening
   transmission lines, parallel and series FACTS devices, resiliency
   constraints and power system angular stability against earthquakes and
   floods in the presence of critical and non-critical loads. In order to
   achieve the best compromise response, the RCGTEP single-objective
   problem is formulated based on the epsilon constraint-based Pareto
   optimization. In addition, this model has the uncertainty of RSs
   availability against natural disasters, so stochastic programming is
   used for RCGTEP. Then, the Benders decomposition (BD) method is used to
   solve the proposed problem and achieve the optimal solution in the
   shortest possible time. Finally, by implementing the proposed model on
   an IEEE standard transmission network, the numerical results confirm the
   capability of this method in improving the economic, operation, angular
   stability and resiliency indices of the power system simultaneously.},

Abstract = {Increasing global environmental concerns encourage a continuous
   reduction in carbon emissions from the shipping industry. It has become
   an irreversible trend to replace traditional fossil fuels with advanced
   energy storage technology. However, an improper energy management leads
   to not only energy waste but also undesired costs and emissions.
   Accordingly, the authors develop a two-layer shipboard energy management
   framework. In the initial stage, a shipboard navigation planning problem
   is formulated that considers battery state estimation and is
   subsequently solved using particle swarm optimisation to obtain an
   optimal speed trajectory. To track the scheduled speed, a reinforcement
   learning method based on a deep Q-Network is proposed in the second
   stage to realise real-time energy management of the diesel generator and
   energy storage system. This approach ensures that the state of charge
   remains within a safe range and that the performance is improved,
   avoiding excessive discharge from the energy storage systems and further
   enhancing the efficiency. The numerical results demonstrate the
   necessity and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {The rising environmental concerns and depletion of fossil fuels have
   promoted the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into modern power
   grids. EVs can serve either as a load or storage, presenting a
   dual-faceted challenge to power system planning and operation. As a
   result, there is a growing need for comprehensive reliability assessment
   in the presence of EVs. This paper proposes improved reliability
   assessment frameworks for systems with large-scale electric vehicles
   (EVs) operating in battery exchange (BE) and plug-in modes. Initially, a
   reliability model for BE electric vehicles (BEVs) is formulated using a
   time-series aggregated EV user load profile, BE station operation
   strategy, and off-peak battery exchange mode of BEVs. Additionally, a
   random-sampling-based operational algorithm is developed for plug-in EVs
   (PEVs), considering their charging, discharging, and grid support modes.
   A composite reliability assessment framework is then developed,
   incorporating an optimization model that accounts for the aggregated
   operations of BEVs and PEVs. The effect of EVs on the system reliability
   is assessed using the mixed-timing sequential Monte Carlo simulation on
   the IEEE RTS-79 and the RTS-GMLC systems. Simulation results show that
   up to 18\% improvement in reliability indices is achieved with a 15\%
   penetration of BEVs operating in off-peak mode. Also, the same
   penetration of PEVs with grid-support modes yields up to 14\%
   improvement in system reliability. Finally, the impacts of BEV and PEV
   integration on the loading and reliability of transmission lines and
   power transformers are analyzed.},

Abstract = {The deployment of renewable energy sources, power-to-gas (P2G) systems,
   and zero-emission vehicles provide a synergistic opportunity to
   accelerate the decarbonization of both power and transportation system.
   This article investigates the prospects of implementing hydrogen P2G
   technology in coupling the power system and the transportation system. A
   novel coordinated long-term planning model of integrated power and
   transportation system (IPTS) at the regional scale is proposed to
   simulate the power system balance and travel demand balance
   simultaneously, while subject to a series of constraints, such as CO2
   emission constraints. IPTS of Texas was investigated considering various
   CO2 emission cap scenarios. Results show unique decarbonization
   trajectories of the proposed coordinated planning model, in which IPTS
   prefers to decarbonizing the power sector firstly. When the power system
   reaches ultralow carbon intensity, the IPTS then focuses on the road
   transportation system decarbonization. The results show that with the
   P2G system, IPTS of Texas could achieve 100\% CO2 emission reductions
   (relative 2018 emissions level) by adding a combination of approximately
   143.5 GW of wind, 50 GW of solar PV, and 40 GW of P2G systems with 2.5\%
   renewables curtailment. The integration of the P2G system can produce
   hydrogen by use of surplus RES generation to meet hydrogen demand of
   Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and to meet multiday electricity
   supply imbalances.},

   traffic-based approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The rising environmental concerns and easily accessible power system
   infrastructure have elevated the use of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)
   in transportation systems. However, PEVs growth is moderate owing to
   range anxiety of drivers. In this context, fast charging stations (FCSs)
   deployment is an emerging development to lower the range anxiety of
   drivers. Though, heavy deployment of PEVs has up-surged the need of load
   demand on power systems. This requires a coordinated operation between
   power systems and future transportation systems to meet their demands.
   The FCS investors have keen interest in the net present value (NPV) of
   the project. On the other hand, the utility wants to keep its peak
   demand within the limits to ensure the safe-operation. This creates a
   contradiction between the FCS investor and utility' objectives. Thus,
   this paper proposes an analytical approach for traffic-based multi-stage
   planning of FCS that aids FCS investor by considering PEV traffic,
   staggered investments, convenience of PEV drivers, profit on
   investments, and capacity limit of FCS imposed by the utility. The
   formulation for NPV is modified to account the revenue incurred owing to
   staggered investments. Proposed methodology determines a set of few
   sub-solutions constrained by mean service time of PEVs. This facilitates
   FCS investor to select the planning solution on the basis of his/her
   satisfaction. Detailed investigation of the proposed methodology
   highlights the applications and importance on assessing the FCS
   investors' concerns while considering the affecting factors of
   transportation system, power system, drivers' concerns, and profit
   margins altogether. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the coordination between electric vehicle (EV)
   fleets, as distributed storage devices, and variable renewable sources
   for mitigating energy imbalances and offering significant potentials for
   energy sustainability in an electricity infrastructure. The paper
   investigates the impact of such integrations for enhancing the
   environmental sustainability, social sustainability, and economic
   operation of electric power systems. The goal is to keep the energy
   sector on track for addressing the 2 degree Celsius (2DC) target per
   Copenhagen climate agreement. 1 The paper identifies strategies for
   large-scale integration of variable generation resources without
   compromising the electricity infrastructure security. The power system
   uncertainties pertaining to hourly load and wind energy forecast errors,
   and random outages of generation and transmission components are taken
   into consideration in Monte Carlo scenarios. The stochastic optimization
   of day-ahead hourly scheduling of electricity is formulated as a mixed
   integer linear programming problem. The merits of the proposed
   optimization model are demonstrated by applying four numerical case
   studies. The conclusion is that the applications of renewable energy
   resources and the intelligent assimilation of EV fleets (both as a
   provider and a consumer of energy) offer major potentials for
   alleviating power system peak demands, minimizing power grid operation

   enables the aggregation of the charging mechanism for energy management
   in the distribution grid, is one of the most significant road blocks to

   A charge control scheme focused on vehicle-to-grid connectivity is
   implemented. It is observed that the rise of environmentally sustainable

   the power network and their infrequent power generation is causing

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the escalating frequency of extreme cold events, power systems
   integrating electric vehicles (EVs) will continually confront resource
   inadequacy challenges due to the changes of temperature-sensitive EV
   loads. Despite the potential of EV loads offering emergency demand
   response (DR) for addressing such challenges, the willingness of EVs to
   respond to DR and the actual response quantity are uncertain.
   Furthermore, the uncertainty level in EV response varies along with DR
   incentive decisions, which further aggravates operation challenges. This
   paper proposes a resilient unit commitment (UC) model for EV-integrated
   power systems against extreme cold events. Specifically, first, we model
   how the temperature-sensitive EV charging loads change under extreme
   cold events considering the actual driving range and air conditioning
   load in EVs. Then, the inter-coupling relationship between uncertainties
   in EV response quantity and the DR incentive decisions is modeled. To
   overcome the limitations of conventional modeling approaches for
   decision-independent uncertainty, an affine function-based tractable
   model reformulation is presented addressing decision-dependent
   uncertainty (DDU) in EV response. Subsequently, we establish the
   resilient UC model within a two-stage stochastic framework considering
   temperature-sensitive EV loads and DDU in EVs' response behaviors. Case
   studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed UC model in cost-efficiently and reliably accommodating
   increased EV loads under extreme cold events.},

Abstract = {The electric power industry landscape is continually evolving. As
   emerging technologies such as wind and solar generating systems become
   more cost effective, traditional power system operating strategies will
   need to be re-evaluated. The presence of wind and solar generation
   (commonly referred to as variable generation or VG) can increase
   variability and uncertainty in the net-load profile. One mechanism to
   mitigate this issue is to schedule and dispatch additional operating
   reserves. These operating reserves aim to ensure that there is enough
   capacity online in the system to account for the increased variability
   and uncertainty occurring at finer temporal resolutions. A new operating
   reserve strategy, referred to as flexibility reserve, has been
   introduced in some regions. A similar implementation is explored in this
   study, and its implications on power system operations are analysed.
   Results show that flexibility reserve products can improve economic
   metrics, particularly in significantly reducing the number of scarcity
   pricing events, with minimal impacts on reliability metrics and
   production costs. The production costs increased due to increased VG
   curtailment - i.e. including the flexible ramping product in the
   commitment of excess thermal capacity that needed to remain online at

Abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources into modern power systems is
   growing rapidly, offering many benefits in the fight against climate
   change. However, the intermittent and unpredictable behaviour of
   renewable energy sources poses new challenges for the planning and
   operation of power systems. To overcome these issues, Vehicle-to-Grid
   (V2G) technology has emerged as a promising solution to address these
   challenges and improve power systems. This research focuses on improving
   the performance of the V2G system by implementing an intelligent fuzzy
   logic-based charge and discharge management system for electric vehicle
   (EV) batteries. The system uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to ensure accurate and
   stable energy extraction from the photovoltaic system, even under
   varying irradiation conditions. Indeed, the fuzzy logic controller, in
   combination with the Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV)/CC
   (Constant Current) strategy, ensures the charging and discharging of the
   electric vehicle batteries according to specific pre-defined conditions.
   The system is connected to the grid using a three-phase inverter
   controlled by the voltage source control strategy. The efficiency of the
   proposed system is supported by detailed simulation results which
   demonstrate maximum power extraction without oscillation or overshoot,
   as well as remarkable stability and resistance to gradual or abrupt
   changes in irradiance and load variations. The fuzzy system facilitates
   intelligent management, allowing EVs to actively participate in energy
   balancing activities, ensuring load con-tinuity and enabling charging of
   other vehicles. The system achieves a constant energy efficiency of 97
   \% under different conditions.},

Abstract = {Due to increasing electric vehicles (EVs) uptakes, power system
   distribution network will have to accommodate the increased load level
   for charging EVs. Thus, the importance of a robust power system
   especially in the distribution network level is indisputable. During the
   planning or reinforcement stage of distribution networks, it is
   paramount to have some estimations and analyses done on system-wide EV
   charging loads that will be placed in the network. Thus, this paper
   systematically investigates the EV fleet composition, market shares, and
   charging patterns within New Zealand (NZ) area. A multivariate
   probabilistic modelling of dependent random variables and cumulative
   distribution functions is adopted for the accurate estimation of
   aggregated EV charging demands. Several vehicle travel survey data sets
   are utilised to quantitatively determine charging behaviours and driving
   patterns of EVs. The developed methodology based on Monte-Carlo
   simulation (MCS) is utilised to generate results close to the real
   use-cases daily power demand, which can be further utilised in the
   analysis of EV charging strategies. In addition, non-smart and smart EV
   charging strategies are introduced to mitigate impacts of the

Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) provide new options for energy balancing of
   power systems. One possible way to use EVs in energy balancing is to let
   each distribution system mitigate its forecast uncertainties through the
   flexibility of EVs. In consideration of the difficulties to directly
   govern a large number of EVs, it is more reasonable for distribution
   systems to dispatch electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs). Without
   influencing driving activities of EVs in the next day, a model is
   established for distribution systems to make use of EVAs, whose
   contributions are delaying uncertainties through their temporal
   flexibility and thus creating opportunities for uncertainties from
   different hours to offset each other. In the established model, a scheme
   of uncertainty transferring is proposed to relieve interruption to EVAs
   and distributionally robust optimization is adopted to evaluate the
   operation plans' average performance with temporal and spatial
   uncertainty correlations considered. Comprehensive case studies are
   carried out based on charging demands of EVAs simulated from real

Abstract = {There has been a suggestion for the best energy management method for an
   electric vehicle with a hybrid power system. The objective is to supply
   the electric vehicle with high-quality electricity. The hybrid power
   system comprises a supercapacitor (SC) bank and a lithium-ion battery.
   The recommended energy management plan attempts to maintain the bus
   voltage while providing the load demand with high-quality power under
   various circumstances. The management controller is built on a
   metaheuristic optimization technique that enhances the flatness
   theory-based controller's trajectory generation parameters. The SC units
   control the DC bus while the battery balances the power on the common
   line. This study demonstrates the expected contribution using particle
   swarm optimization and performance are assessed under various
   optimization parameters, including population size and maximum
   iterations. Their effects on controller performance are examined in the
   study. The outcomes demonstrate that the number of iterations
   significantly influences the algorithm's ability to determine the best
   controller parameters. The results imply that combining metaheuristic
   optimization techniques with flatness theory can enhance power quality.
   The suggested management algorithm ensures power is shared efficiently,

Abstract = {This study presents the potential role of thermal power generation in a

   considering different sources of demand side flexibility such as heat
   pumps and heat storages in district heating, demand response from

   engines as the share of wind power and solar photovoltaic increases.
   Demand side flexibility measures pushed this trend further. The results
   from the unit commitment and economic dispatch model demonstrate that
   the flexibility measures decrease the ramping frequency of thermal
   units, while the ramp rates of thermal units remain largely unchanged or
   increased. This indicates that the flexibility measures can cover
   smaller ramps in the net load more cost-effectively but that thermal
   power plants are still valuable for larger ramps. Impacts on emissions

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Following COP26, many countries are embarking on decarbonization
   strategies for the power sector that may include inter alia storage,
   hydrogen, and carbon capture (and storage). There is also significant
   increase in load that may come in the form of electric vehicles (EV)
   charging and hydrogen requirement for decarbonization of other sectors.
   While there is a growing literature around long-term decarbonization
   strategies, there is still ample room for a practical methodology to
   rigorously test capacity plans to include a range of options inter alia
   re- optimization of the mix of renewable technologies, better
   coordination of the (EV) load from a system perspective, or augmenting
   the plan with battery energy storage (BESS) and hydrogen. This paper
   presents our research on EV load and green hydrogen modeling including
   how they can be integrated into long-term electricity models. We also
   present a methodology that allows planners to undertake a rigorous
   assessment that can be readily implemented using the World Bank
   Electricity Planning Model (EPM). The application of the model is
   illustrated through a case study for Turkey (Turkiye) for 2050. The case
   study shows how an incumbent policy-driven capacity plan for 2050 that
   included 33\% contribution from variable renewable energy (VRE) may be
   prone to unserved energy risk during winter months due to seasonal
   variability of VRE. The analysis goes on to demonstrate how the plan can
   be reinforced with additional peaking gas turbines, re- optimization of
   wind and solar, BESS and hydrogen. Coordinated charging of EVs is also
   shown to bring significant relief to investment requirements.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) for a dc
   distribution system for power system integration of plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEVs). The dc distribution system is intended to integrate
   electric vehicles in a parking lot with an ac grid through bidirectional
   dc-dc converters (battery chargers) and a central voltage-sourced
   converter. Using an online constrained optimization algorithm, the
   proposed EMS manages the power flow within the dc system. Thus, the PEV
   owners can charge or discharge their batteries based on the
   state-of-charge of the batteries and their upcoming trip plans. The EMS
   offers two energy exchange options to the PEV owners: 1) the fast energy
   exchange option for the owners wishing to minimize the energy exchange
   time; and 2) the optimal energy exchange option for the owners intend to
   either minimize their costs of charging or maximize their revenues
   through selling their stored energy. The proposed EMS seamlessly handles
   all charging/discharging requests from the PEV owners with different
   options and, at the same time, it takes into account the power demand
   and power generation limits of the ac grid to preclude under-voltage,
   over-voltage, and reverse power flow issues. Various energy exchange
   scenarios are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   EMS.},

Title = {Enabling mass integration of electric vehicles through distributed
   energy resource management systems},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {157},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Global initiatives are actively progressing to integrate large numbers
   of electric vehicles (EVs) as part of efforts to electrify and
   decarbonize the transportation sector. This approach plays a crucial
   role in addressing global greenhouse emissions and pollution problems.
   However, mass integration of EVs imposes unprecedented challenges to
   electrical power systems, especially to their distribution grids. These
   challenges range from planning issues, where the traditional panning
   procedures are not adequate for integration of EVs and their charging
   stations, to operational challenges, where a huge number of dispersed
   EVs can cause peak load increase, voltage violations, congestions,
   feeder overloads, etc. Hence, despite the significant importance of
   maximizing the deployment of EVs, their stochastic integration can give
   rise to critical challenges in electric power systems, thereby impeding
   their subsequent expansion. Therefore, in order to properly integrate
   mass amounts of EVs, without causing technical violations in the
   electrical power system, intelligent software tools are required, to aid
   distribution system operators and engineers in the transition to a new
   era of electrified transportation. In this paper, we argue that novel
   software solutions called Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems
   (DERMSs) are a key solution for enabling a safe integration of mass
   amounts of EVs into emerging distribution grids. Specifically, we
   introduce a novel Hybrid DERMS framework, as an integration of multiple
   hierarchical levels of DER management solutions, and propose this
   solution as a suitable instrument for distribution system operators and
   grid engineers to safely integrate and manage high volumes of EVs within
   the grid infrastructure. The hypothesis is validated through a real
   -life use case for integration and management of high amounts of EVs
   into an existing distribution grid, using an industrial DERMS solution.
   Specifically, an in-depth analysis of adding two large charging
   stations, boasting capacities of 5 MW each, has been performed through
   all stages of integration, from the planning stage, up to using their
   flexible output to manage technical constraint violations in real time.
   The influence of these EV charging stations on both the feeder where
   they are planned to be integrated, as well as on the entire supply
   substation, have been analyzed in detail. The resultant findings,
   especially on successfully managing overloads, peak load increases, as
   well as voltage violations through intelligent use of aggregated EVs
   through DERMS, have proven to be notably encouraging, further
   substantiating the paper's hypothesis.},

Abstract = {High-power pulsed load (HPPL) such as airborne laser weapon and radar
   poses a severe challenge to aircraft electrical power system. Since peak
   power cannot be satisfied only by generator, hybrid energy storage
   system (HESS) should be well sized to match their energetic performances
   versus instantaneous power requirement and improve reliability of
   electrical power system. To deal with these challenges, a sizing
   optimization for HESS with considering energy management strategy (EMS)
   based on virtual-droop control in aircraft is proposed in this paper. By
   analyzing the spectrum characteristics of HPPL profile, splitting
   frequency between different types of energy storage devices is specially
   analyzed and designed to give full play to HESS. HESS weight, loss and
   parameters in EMS are taken into account in this multi-objective
   optimization based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms II
   (NSGA-II). Series of Pareto fronts can be obtained through the
   optimization process, and the most suitable solutions of different HESS
   combinations are selected by a decision-making means which combines
   subjective and objective weighting methods. Finally, optimization
   results of four different combinations are compared. Simulation results
   are obtained in MATLAB/Simulink environment to prove the rationality and
   applicability of the optimal sizing tool. The research has resulted in a
   solution of HESS and EMS optimization for HPPL used in aircraft.},

Title = {Multi-objective optimal short-term planning of renewable distributed
   generations and capacitor banks in power system considering different
   uncertainties including plug-in electric vehicles},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The increasing penetration of solar distributed generations (SDGs) and
   wind distributed generations (WDGs) together with plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEVs) will lead to a promising amount of reduction in
   greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, they bring about adversities
   such as uncertainty in production-load sides, augmented power loss, and
   voltage instability in the power system, which should be carefully
   addressed to increase the reliability. In this concern, this paper
   proposes a multi-objective optimization methodology for sizing and
   siting of SDGs, WDGs, and capacitor banks (CBs) in the power system
   considering uncertainties stemmed from PEVs load demand, solar
   irradiance, wind speed, and the conventional load. The understudy
   objectives are the voltage stability index, green-house gas emissions,
   and the total cost. An unconventional point estimate method (PEM) is
   used to handle the related uncertainties, and chance-constrained
   programming method is deployed to deal with smooth constraints. The
   corresponding probability distribution functions of output variables are
   estimated by the maximum entropy method. Furthermore, robustness
   analysis is made by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed
   methodology is applied to a typical radial distribution network. The
   results show that the presence of PEV's significantly increases the load
   demand, which results in voltage collapse in the distribution system
   without the presence of distributed generations. However, the proposed
   probabilistic method ensures the safe operation of the distribution
   system with the optimal allocation of renewable distributed generations
   and CBs. Moreover, the results of deterministic and probabilistic cases
   are compared under different penetration levels of PEVs. The best
   tradeoff solution of the Pareto front is selected by the fuzzy
   satisfying method.},

Abstract = {This article outlines methods to facilitate the assessment of the impact

   reinforcements as well as novel solutions including voltage regulation
   are considered. To account for electric vehicle charging, a method to
   determine the uptake in equivalent load is presented. For this, measured
   data of households and statistical data of electric vehicles are
   combined in a stochastic analysis to determine the simultaneity factors
   of household load including electric vehicle charging. The developed
   methods are applied to an exemplary case study with Norwegian
   low-voltage networks. Different penetration rates of electric vehicles

Title = {Advanced Distributed Energy Resources and On-Load Tap-Changer Control
   Principles for Enhanced Flexibility Services Provision},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {161768-161785},
Abstract = {Due to large-scale integration of variable renewable generation and
   accelerating electrification of transportation and heating sectors as
   well as industrial processes, increased amount of flexibility is needed
   from different voltage levels to fulfill simultaneously the flexibility
   needs of local distribution system operators (DSOs) and system-wide
   transmission system operator (TSO). This paper develops further the
   coordinated and frequency level-dependent distributed energy resources
   (DERs) control and adaptive on-load-tap-changers (OLTCs) management
   scheme which enables prioritized flexibility services provision for the
   DSOs and TSO. The key idea of the scheme is that the coordination of
   flexibility utilisation between DSOs and TSOs is done depending on the
   severity of the situation from the whole power system's viewpoint
   regarding frequency deviation level. During smaller frequency deviations
   DSOs' needs are prioritized and during larger frequency deviations
   priority is on TSO's needs to support momentarily the stability of the
   whole power system. The overall target of the studied management scheme
   is also to increase DERs', especially photovoltaics' (PVs') and electric
   vehicles' (EVs'), hosting capacity in the DSOs' networks and increase
   DERs availability for the flexibility services provision to the TSO
   during smaller frequency deviations. In this paper, enhanced OLTC
   control principles are presented including novel interconnection
   transformer OLTC control scheme for larger medium-voltage (MV)
   network-connected DER units. This MV DER OLTC control logic can enable,
   for example, same DER active power response with 7.7\% smaller current
   or 8.5\% higher DER unit active power response with the same current
   value. In addition, this paper studies the effect of different OLTC
   control inputs, DER reactive power control settings, LV feeder length
   and large-scale integration of EVs on low-voltage (LV) network with
   multiple PSCAD simulations. At the end, further improvement
   possibilities of the studied management scheme are also briefly
   described.},

Abstract = {The widespread proliferation of Electric Vehicles (EVs) can have a

   consumed by EVs when charging is substantial, which has consequences on

   modeling is based on 2 years of time-stamped aggregate power consumption
   from over 2400 charging stations in Washington State and San Diego,
   California. The different data sets allow the influence of time-of-use
   pricing on the time-series models to be explored. Weekday, weekend, and
   near-term and long-term models are developed and analyzed. The best
   performing near-term weekday models are (2, 0, 0) x (0, 1, 1)(24) x (1,
   0, 0)(120) for Washington State and (2, 0, 0) x (1, 1, 0)(24) x (0, 0,

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {As a form of renewable and low-carbon energy resource, wind power is
   anticipated to play an essential role in the future energy structure.
   Whereas, its features of time mismatch with power demand and uncertainty
   pose barriers for the power system to utilize it effectively. Hence, a
   novel unit commitment model is proposed in this paper considering demand
   response and electric vehicles, which can promote the exploitation of
   wind power. On the one hand, demand response and electric vehicles have
   the feasibility to change the load demand curve to solve the mismatch
   problem. On the other hand, they can serve as reserve for wind power. To
   deal with the unit commitment problem, authors use a fuzzy
   chance-constrained program that takes into account the wind power
   forecasting errors. The numerical study shows that the model can promote
   the utilization of wind power evidently, making the power system
   operation more eco-friendly and economical. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Here, an optimisation framework is proposed for integrated resource
   expansion planning (IREP) including conventional generation units, wind
   generation units, and transmission lines while taking into account the
   role of demand response program (DRP) aggregators. This problem is a
   bi-level optimisation problem. In the upper-level problem, the objective
   function is to maximise the profit for each resource, that is, the
   generation company (GENCO), wind generation company (WINDCO), and
   transmission company (TRANSCO) as well as the DRP aggregator. Also, the
   lower-level problem considers a market model with the participation of
   private GENCOs, WINDCOs, TRANSCOs, and DRP aggregators. The lower-level
   problem minimises energy cost subject to AC power flow (PF) equations,
   power network limitations, pollution constraint, GENCO, WINDCO, TRANSCO
   constraints, and technical limitations of DRPs. Here, the lower-level
   problem is non-linear and non-convex. Accordingly, to facilitate the
   solution of the proposed bi-level optimisation problem, a linear model
   is proposed. Then, the proposed bilevel optimisation problem is
   converted into an integrated single-level one using the
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Eventually, a mixed-integer linear
   programming (MILP) model is proposed. The proposed method is applied to
   the IEEE 6-bus and the IEEE 30-bus test systems, and finally, the
   capabilities of the proposed scheme are evaluated.},

Abstract = {Rapid development of electric vehicles holds the promise to
   significantly mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, the lack of
   pervasive en-route charging infrastructure on regional highway networks
   hinders the use of electric vehicles for long-distance intercity trips.
   Traditionally, transportation and power systems are often studied
   separately, each by itself as a complex system. This paper proposes a
   system of systems modeling framework for planning charging
   infrastructure deployment in intercity transportation networks while
   considering users' travel behavior and coupling relationships between
   transportation and power systems. The aim is at facilitating
   long-distance electric vehicle travels and providing an effective and
   comprehensive tool to evaluate the total emissions from both the
   transportation and power sectors. We look at a somewhat
   ``forward-looking{''} problem in which the charging loads of
   widely-adopted electric vehicles induce interdependence between the
   power and the transportation sectors. A general equilibrium modeling
   framework is developed to capture the interdependencies among charging
   infrastructure design, users' travel behaviors, and power sector
   operations. An iterative solution approach is proposed to solve the
   overall equilibrium between the transportation and power sectors, and a
   heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the bi-level subproblem for
   the charging infrastructure deployment. Numerical experiments based on a
   semi-realistic case study are performed to demonstrate the applicability
   of the proposed modeling and solution approach.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Integrating plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into a smart grid can pose
   some challenges, particularly when a significant number of these
   vehicles are simultaneously charged and discharged. However, smart
   management of PEVs in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system can result in
   benefits to the grid such as load leveling, and cost reduction. This
   paper proposes a unit commitment model for a V2G system connected to a
   smart power grid. The model considers different penetration levels of
   PEVs and investigates the economic and technical effects of using PEVs
   to support the grid. The proposed methodology incorporates controlled
   charging and discharging as well as accounting for battery degradation
   in the unit commitment problem. The model is tested using an IEEE 24 bus
   network to determine the impact of high PEV penetration on generation
   cost. A comparison between a system without V2G and a system with V2G is
   presented to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach. The
   results show that the optimal scheduling of PEVs leads to reduction in
   generation cost and is effective in leveling the load profile through

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Optimal placement of parking lots with optimal scheduling in power
   systems to maximize the benefit, considering different peak load states
   and different electricity prices for each state, is studied in this
   paper. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is tested on the IEEE
   33-bus distribution test system with considering the power system
   constraints and using genetic algorithm. This algorithm selects the
   optimal sites and sizes (number of electric vehicles) of these parking
   lots and shows the optimal results. The results of these simulations
   with genetic algorithm demonstrate that the economic problem of parking
   lots placement depends on many items such as number of the electrical
   vehicles (EVs) in each parking lot (capacity of parking lot), state of
   charge of EVs, as well as the electricity price in peak/off-peak
   periods. Moreover, it is suggested that the existence of parking lots,
   considering adequate incentives for EVs owners, has economic benefit for
   distribution network operators, reduces total power loss, and can
   improve the distribution,system voltage profile. Also, the number of
   parking lots to be allocated in a distribution system supports the
   distribution system at peak load hours because it is more interesting
   from economic point of view to install more parking lots. Copyright (C)

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper, a new structure, the so-called FBSCUCP-P/EV unit
   commitment (SCUC) in the presence of false data injection (FDI) attack
   into the communication infrastructure of electric vehicle parking lot
   (EVPL). Herein, the uncertain EVPLs are integrated into the SCUC problem
   with the aim of reducing the operation cost. It is notable that growing
   integration of unspecified EVPLs can introduce novel challenges to the
   power system, significantly impacting its flexibility. In this study,
   electric vehicles are leveraged as a means to enhance system
   flexibility. Meanwhile, the FDI attacks in EVPLs can distort the
   system's flexibility and lead to inaccurate assessments of the power
   system's ability to adapt to changing conditions. In order to model the
   FDI attack, a bi-level optimization problem based on mixed integer
   linear programming is formulated. At the upper level, the impact of
   EVPLs on the flexibility indices of the SCUC is evaluated, and the false
   data injected into the EVPL is calculated at the lower level. Since both
   levels of the proposed FBSCUCP-P/EV FDI include discrete variables, a
   reformulation and decomposition technique is utilized to achieve the
   optimal solution. Instead, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based
   machine learning method is considered to detection and correction of FDI
   attack. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 24-bus system. The
   simulation results initially indicate the improvement of the flexibility
   of the power system in proposed structure. Further, injecting false data
   into all available EVPLs causes to increase the system operation cost.
   Besides, false data leads to distorted charging and discharging
   scheduling of EVPLs; likewise, scheduling and commitment of power
   generation units also changes. Subsequently, the application of the
   XGBoost algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of FDI attacks,
   achieving a maximum accuracy of 85.41\%.},

Abstract = {To reduce the overloading of the power system due to the increasing use
   of electric vehicles (EVs), the power system operators employ dynamic
   cost plans depending on the number of EVs being charged. In this
   situation, the charging cost of an EV can be reduced by considering
   other EVs' charging strategies and avoiding simultaneous charging. In
   this article, we develop a distributed EV charging mechanism (D-EVCM)
   where each EV possesses some information, such as the charging
   probabilities of other EVs, electricity price, current energy level, and
   expected departure time. Based on the information, an EV periodically
   decides whether to charge its battery in a distributed manner. To
   minimize the average charging cost of EV while avoiding the situation
   where an EV departs from a charging station with insufficient energy
   level, a constrained stochastic game model is formulated and its
   solution is obtained using a best response dynamics-based algorithm. The
   evaluation results show that D-EVCM can reduce the average charging cost
   over 48\% with a sufficient low battery outage probability (e.g.,
   0.01\%) compared to a threshold-based charging scheme.},

Abstract = {The combined use of batteries and supercapacitors is an alternative to
   reconcile the higher energy density of batteries with the high power
   density of supercapacitors. The optimal sizing of this assembly,
   especially with the minimization of mass, is one of the challenges of
   designing the power system of an electric vehicle. The condition of the
   unpredictability of the power demand determined by the vehicle driver
   must also be added, which must be met by the power system without
   exceeding safe operating limits for the devices. This article presents a
   methodology for minimizing the mass of the electrical energy storage
   system (ESS) that considers the various aspects mentioned and a variety
   of battery technologies and supercapacitor values. The resulting minimum
   mass dimensioning is verified by simulation for different driving cycles
   under conditions of maximum power demand. The system also includes a
   tertiary source, such as a fuel cell, responsible for the vehicle's
   extended autonomy. In addition to sizing the ESS, the article also
   proposes a management strategy for the various sources to guarantee the

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the realm of the smart grid, there are new issues that are needed to
   be addressed. However, these new concerns may have an adverse effect on
   the complexity of the operation of the network, they present great
   opportunities to the network operators for a better service, in terms of
   lower costs and enhanced security. In this paper, the integration of the
   coordinated aggregated Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) fleets and Demand
   Response Programs (DRPs) into power systems is studied using the
   stochastic reliability-based Security Constrained Unit Commitment
   (SCUC). The proposed SCUC program minimizes network operation costs
   while determining the best strategy for deployment of PEVs and DRPs.
   Moreover, the proposed approach analyze the effect of these resources on
   the adequacy of the power system by considering reliability metrics
   Being a mobile power storing device enables the PEVs to provide their
   energy to the network when called upon. Moreover, DRPs can mitigate
   power consumption during the peak load or in case of a contingency.
   Optimal integration of these resources could reduce the network
   operating costs and improve security. A two-stage stochastic
   mixed-integer programming model is employed for power system modeling in
   a smart grid environment. In the proposed model, PEV fleets are modeled
   as virtual power plants that can provide electric power while DRPs are
   assumed to only affect the power consumption of the customers. The
   proposed paradigm is applied to the IEEE 6-bus and IEEE Reliability Test
   System (RTS) to illustrate its effectiveness. Numerical analyses confirm
   the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in lessening the cost of
   network operations, better performance in case of contingencies and a
   higher level of reliability. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evaluating the effect of electric vehicle parking lots in
   transmission-constrained AC unit commitment under a hybrid
   IGDT-stochastic approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Power network operators have recently faced new challenges due to an
   increase in the penetration of nondispatchable renewable energy sources
   in power grids. Incorporating emerging flexible resources like electric
   vehicle parking lots (EVPLs) and demand response programs (DRPs) into
   power systems, could be a good solution to deal with inherent
   uncertainties imposed by these resources to the power grid. EVPLs can
   improve power system operating conditions by active and reactive power
   injection capabilities. The participation of consumers in DRPs can also
   improve energy consumption management by decreasing or shifting loads to
   other periods. This paper proposes a hybrid information gap decision
   theory (IGDT)stochastic method to solve a transmission constrained AC
   unit commitment model integrated with electric vehicle (EV),
   incentive-based DRP, and wind energy. The behavioural uncertainty
   related to EV owners is modelled using a scenario-based method.
   Additionally, an IGDT method is applied to manage wind energy
   uncertainty under a two-level optimization model. Verification of the
   proposed model is done under several case studies. Based on the results
   achieved, the proposed risk-based hybrid model allows the operator to
   differentiate between the risk level of existing uncertainties and apply
   a high-flexibility decision-making model to deal with such difficulties.
   Additionally, the role of the aforementioned flexible resources in the
   reduction of power system running costs and wind power uncertainty
   handling are evaluated. Numerical results confirm a 3.7\% reduction in
   the daily operating costs as a consequence of coordinated scheduling of
   EVPL and DRP. Moreover, Taking advantage of reactive power injection of
   EVPL provides more cost savings.},

Abstract = {Electrification of transport and the deployment of plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEVs) shift emissions from tail-pipes to bulk power systems
   (BPSs). Coordinated distributed energy resources and PEV charging can
   mitigate the impact of this shift. This study presents an analysis of
   photovoltaic (PV) solar parking lots that address this benefit.
   Real-world charging data, solar data, and electricity tariffs are used
   to determine the microgrid system that minimises the cost of
   retrofitting an existing parking lot with PV and PEV infrastructure
   coupled. The result is a load scheduling algorithm that takes into
   account tariffs and insolation to reduce costs while ensuring customer
   satisfaction. The techno-economic feasibility of PV infrastructure in
   the microgrid is determined by minimising the net present cost (NPC) in
   two case studies: Victoria, BC, and Los Angeles, CA. Relatively low
   solar irradiation and electricity prices make it economically infeasible
   to install solar panels in Victoria even though the operational costs
   are reduced by 11\%. In Los Angeles, high time-of-use prices, together
   with abundant solar radiation, make PV retrofitting economically
   feasible with any array capacity. At the current solar infrastructure
   price, coordinated charging in this region yields 8-16\% savings on NPC
   and smaller feeder size requirements with greater load growth

Abstract = {The increasing electric vehicles (EVs) and their integration with the
   electrical networks to achieve the charging demands has highly affected
   the operation of the power system. These effects are due to the
   increased and variable amount of electricity consumption caused by the
   irregular charging patterns of EVs. As the EV penetration level
   increases with such irregular charging patterns, the overall load
   profile in a network will increase resulting in load peaks. To overcome
   this, a well-planned charging-discharging algorithm is needed for the EV
   users and the power suppliers. In light of the above issues and
   requirements, this paper proposes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   simulation-based EV charging (EVC) behavior models and
   charging-discharging power prediction models. The proposed methods
   analyze the traveling behavior of EVs, and their charging patterns to
   make EV a flexible load. This helps in understanding the variable
   electricity consumption and mitigating the peak loads and load
   variations. Further, to assess the operation of the proposed methods,
   the charging-discharging power prediction is carried out for a large EV
   fleet based on the historical data. The power predictions are carried
   out for 100 days and the convergence of the proposed algorithm is
   targeted to be kept below 0.5\% to achieve optimal power prediction. The
   results showed the credibility of the proposed approach in identifying
   the daily average charging-discharging load curves.},

Abstract = {The uncertain renewable energy sources (RESs) and grid integration of EV
   charging stations create several operational challenges in the power

   model for EV charging scheduling that integrates stochastic
   network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) with N-1 criteria and network

   distribution factors (LODF) method is proposed for the post-contingency

   N-k line outages. In addition, the bender decomposition approach is
   employed to simplify the problem complexity. Hence, this work evaluates
   the impact of transportation networks for EV charging stations and N-k
   outages in a proposed model for economic and technical benefits. The
   validity of the NCUC model is substantiated through verification using
   IEEE 24-bus systems. The economic benefits shared by EV charging

Abstract = {Buildings, with their heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
   systems are the promising demand side resources for power grid to cope
   with the wind uncertainty. The challenge, however, is to ensure an
   efficient incorporation of large scale of HVACs into unit commitment to
   enhance the intra-hour flexibility for system operation. To this end,
   this paper focuses on the aggregation and scheduling of multi-chiller

   continuous-time modeling method is utilized to handle the sub-hourly
   variability of wind power and the intra-hour flexibility of the HVAC
   systems. To describe the electricity consumption characteristic of the
   HVAC system with multiple chillers, a cooling model is formulated based
   on the chiller load sharing strategy and linearization method. Besides,
   an aggregation method for heterogeneous HVACs to provide reserve

   results on the modified IEEE 118-test systems validate the effectiveness

   fossil fuels and achieve the goals of decarbonizing the economy.
   However, interconnecting a large quantity of distributed energy
   resources (DERs) to the power system reveals technical problems
   affecting the entire system. Planning coordinators and grid operators
   need to understand the full-spectrum impact of DERs on the power system
   to ensure secure and reliable grid planning and operations. The
   operation of a Hydro-Que<acute accent>bec transmission system planned
   for 2030 is simulated in quasi-static time series mode with a massive
   integration of 1 million of electric vehicles and 1000 - 3000 MW of
   distributed photovoltaics. This paper provided findings on assessment of
   high DER penetrations impacts on the transmission system in terms of
   voltage control, mitigation means used, MVAR availability and
   consumption margin, generating unit optimal operation, and switching
   actions of several equipment.},

Abstract = {With the increase penetration of new energy and electric vehicles (EVs),
   the nodal voltage violations (NVVs) problem is widely concerned. Voltage
   predictive regulation methods can prevent NVVs and improve the
   performance of traditional voltage control. A fast and reliable
   forecasting method for NVVs is a key requirement to support this
   application. However, it is time-consuming to forecast NVVs using a
   Monte Carlo simulation-based probabilistic load flow method and the
   traditional deterministic method based on load forecasting has low
   reliability due to it not considering the uncertainty of load
   forecasting errors. A novel fast forecasting method for NVVs with
   shorter computational time and higher reliability is proposed. In the
   proposed method, the uncertainty of the load forecasting is taken into
   account and the impact of active/reactive power change on NVVs can be
   quantified like the traditional deterministic method. Thus, this method
   can assist in correcting voltage regulation plans so that voltage
   constraints can be satisfied as much as possible. Finally, the IEEE
   69-bus test system and real historical load series are used to validate
   the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {To further improve the utilization level of distributed photovoltaics
   (PV) and realize low-carbon travel, a novel optimization cooperative
   model that considers multi-stakeholders in-cluding integrated prosumers
   (IP), power to hydrogen (P2H), and grid company (GC) is proposed, based
   on the Nash bargaining theory. Electricity trading among the three and
   hydrogen trading between IP and P2H is considered in the model to
   maximize their own interests. Specifically, IP focus on distributed PV
   integration and low carbon travels, P2H strives to improve cost
   competitiveness of hydrogen, and electricity-hydrogen trading prices and
   quantities are optimized between them. Also, GC obtains profits by
   charging grid fees considering power flow constraints. The cooperation
   game model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming
   problem through linearization methods. Case studies show that
   electricity-hydrogen trading among the three has apparent advantages
   over pure electricity coupling or non-cooperation. With future reduction
   of investment prices of PV and P2H and maturity of the carbon trading

Abstract = {To promote the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), a charging
   facility (CF) planning model based on Yen's algorithm is proposed for
   coupled transportation and distribution systems (DSs) considering
   traffic congestion. This model not only takes into account the influence
   of new CFs on the power system but also considers the impact of CF
   locations on traffic flow distribution and congestion level in the
   transportation system (TS). Yen's algorithm is innovatively employed to
   offer multiple possible choices for EV drivers' route selection
   considering CF locations determined in the traffic flow assignment
   model. Overall, the total cost of both distribution and TSs is minimized
   to obtain the optimal CF planning results. For the DS, generation cost,
   energy loss, and penalty cost for voltage deviation are included. For
   the TS, the main objective is to ensure EVs can reach their destinations
   at the lowest cost, while the travel time due to different path
   selections and the delay time caused by congestion can be minimized.

Title = {Chance-constrained scheduling considering frequency support from

Journal = {IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {With the share of renewable generation increasing, considerable
   synchronous generators have been displaced. This trend results in the
   decline of system inertia and thus raises the frequency secure issue.
   Concurrently, electric vehicles (EVs) proliferate. Numerous EVs hold a
   huge potential of frequency regulation in case of contingency as EVs are
   able to achieve primary frequency responses (PFRs) via vehicle to grid
   chargers. However, the value of frequency responses from aggregated EVs
   has not fully exploited. This paper, proposes a chance constrained
   scheduling model incorporating the ability of PFRs from aggregated EVs.
   The proposed model characterizes uncertainties associated PFR capacities
   from aggregated EVs and wind power forecast errors by the
   Wasserstein-metric ambiguity sets, which do not rely on distributional
   assumption, and then formulates uncertainties-related constraints as
   distributionally robust (DR) chance constraints. These DR chance
   constraints are reformulated as tractable linear programs. Consequently,
   the proposed model leads to a mixed-integer linear program. Numerical
   results on a modified IEEE 39-bus system show that incorporating PFR
   from EVs can reduce total costs from \$4,540,396 to \$4,431,233, which
   is reduced by 2.4\%. The proposed model also achieves better reliability
   compared to traditional methods, demonstrating the distributionally
   robust optimization in enhancing electricity scheduling and rising
   renewable integration.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {147},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy causes high uncertainty,
   which further complicates the optimal scheduling operation of power
   systems. The uncertainty of renewable energy output is represented by
   empirical prediction intervals in the traditional interval optimization
   scheduling model, but the interval range is not precise enough. To
   address this problem, a novel improved interval optimization method is
   proposed in this paper. First, the improved adaptive diffusion kernel
   density estimation (IADKDE) is used to obtain more accurate intervals
   for the renewable energy output. Furthermore, a data-driven adaptive
   optimal bandwidth selection is adopted to select the optimal bandwidth
   instead of normal reference rules in IADKDE. In addition, the day-ahead
   scheduling optimization model is developed by IADKDE considering the
   driving requirements of electric vehicles (EVs) owners. The proposed
   model is described in details and solved by interval linear programming
   method. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method
   are validated, and the comparative analysis with interval optimization
   by empirical prediction intervals, extreme learning machine(ELM) and
   stochastic optimization is given. It is demonstrated that the proposed
   method can obtain more accurate interval ranges of uncertain variables

   power fluctuations at the grid side, power quality issues, and equipment
   loss of life. Distributed generators (DGs) are an effective way to

Pages = {297-324},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article explores the potential impacts of integrating electric
   vehicles (EVs) and variable renewable energy (VRE) on power system
   operation. EVs and VRE are integrated in a production cost model with a
   5 min time resolution and multiple planning horizons to deduce the
   effects of variable generation and EV charging on system operating
   costs, EV charging costs, dispatch stacks, reserves and VRE curtailment.
   EV penetration scenarios of the light-duty vehicle fleet of 10\%, 20\%,
   and 30\% are considered in the RTS-GMLC test system, and VRE penetration
   is 34\% of annual energy consumption. The impacts of EVs are
   investigated during the annual peak in the summer and during the four
   weeks of the year in which high VRE and low loads lead to
   overgeneration. Uncoordinated and coordinated EV charging scenarios are
   considered. In the uncoordinated scenario, charging is undertaken at the
   convenience of the EV owners, modeled using data from the Idaho National
   Laboratory's EV Project. Coordinated charging uses an ``aggregator{''}
   model, wherein EV charging is scheduled to minimize operating costs
   while meeting the daily charging requirements subject to EV availability
   and charging constraints. The results show that at each EV penetration
   level, the uncoordinated charging costs were higher than the coordinated
   charging costs. During a high-VRE, low-load week, with uncoordinated EV
   charging at 30\% penetration (3\% energy penetration), the peak load
   increased by as much as 27\%. Using coordinated charging, the EV load
   shifts to hours with low prices, coincident with either low load, high
   VRE, or both. Furthermore, coordinated charging substantially reduces
   the curtailment of PV by as much as nine times during the low-load
   seasons, and the curtailment of wind generation by more than half during
   the summer peak season, compared to the scenarios with no EVs and
   uncoordinated EV charging. Using a production cost model with multiple
   planning cycles, load and VRE forecasts, and a ``look ahead{''} period
   during scheduling and dispatching units was crucial in creating and
   utilizing the flexibility of coordinated EV charging.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Due to the increasing integration of renewable forms of generation,
   ageing network infrastructure, and rapid increase in peak load demand,
   flexibility is becoming economically more viable and hence significant
   role player in the future power system. There is vast amount of
   literature on flexibility covering research, demonstration and
   validation activities. Nevertheless, there is still no unifying
   definition of the term ``flexibility{''} and consistent characterizing
   terms for ``flexibility resources{''}. The lack of clarity in
   definitions and concepts may undermine information exchange amongst
   stakeholders imposing hurdles on the transition from mature technology
   to in-vestment decisions and deployment. System operators, for example,
   require better clarity for the techno-economic evaluation of flexibility
   resources in their planning processes. This paper, by reviewing
   prominent flexibility-related publications, proposes a comprehensive
   flexibility definition and unified characterizing terms for flexibility
   resources. Furthermore, the paper proposes a taxonomy method which is
   applied to classify flexibility resources. The presented taxonomy method
   clears the confusion on ``what-is-what{''} under the concept of
   flexibility. This paper also presents the benefits of unified
   characterizing terms in mapping flexibility resources to ancillary
   services. The benefits are illustrated by considering a realistic use

Abstract = {With the rapid growth of the number of Electric Vehicles (EVs), access
   to large-scale EVs will bring serious safety hazards to the operation
   planning of the power system. It needs to be supported by an effective
   EV charging and discharging behavior control strategy to meet the
   operation demand of the power system. An optimization model with the
   objectives of minimizing grid load variance and minimizing user charging
   cost is established. An improved hybrid algorithm is proposed for the
   optimal allocation of charging and discharging power of EVs by combining
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and gravitational search
   algorithm (GSA). The performance of variant algorithm is tested using
   CEC2005 benchmarking functions sets and applied to the solution of the
   ordered charge-discharge optimal scheduling model. The results show that
   the convergence accuracy of the algorithm is better than the traditional
   algorithm, and it can effectively balance exploration and exploitation
   ability of the particles. In addition, the scheduling analysis is
   performed for different charging strategies of EVs. The scheduling
   results show that with the same optimization weights, implementing the
   ordered charging and discharging strategy can significantly reduce the
   charging cost of users and the load variance of the grid. Thus, the
   operational stability of the grid and the economic benefits for users

Abstract = {Non-linear loads, electrical vehicles (EVs) and power electronics are
   the sources of harmonic generation in the power system. Harmonics are
   the reason for the disturbance in the technical constraints and quality
   of the power system. These disadvantages are formed in the current and
   the voltage of the system branches and buses. To reduce these harmonics,
   active and passive power filters are used. Since active power filters
   (APFs) include electronic power switching devices, they are used to
   eliminate or reduce current or voltage harmonics. To properly reduce
   these harmonics and supply consumer demand, private investors (PIs) are
   considered to enhance the power quality, by investing in the APF units
   and the distribution network operator (DNO) coordinating and feeding the
   EVs, by equipping the network with smart parking lots. Total harmonic
   distortion, bus voltage profile, active power loss and energy not
   supplied (ENS) are considered problem attributes. Using techniques for
   order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS), it is
   determined how the addition of photovoltaic (PV), energy storage system,
   and batteries affects the ranking of attributes from the perspectives of
   both DNO and PI. The best solutions are obtained in the first stage
   using a genetic algorithm (GA), and the attributes have been prioritized
   from a utility perspective in the second stage by TOPSIS. To verify the
   performance of GA and TOPSIS, all of the obtained results are compared
   with the other algorithms. As seen clearly, active, reactive power loss
   and ENS in scenarios with the participation PV are reduced. Furthermore,
   comparing the results of different algorithms confirms the efficiency of
   GA and TOPSIS.
   Here, a private investor, to enhance power quality, invests in active

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {2591-2601},
Abstract = {Hybrid powertrains have widely been developed as eco-friendly system and
   commercialized in the passenger vehicle market with clear benefits over
   conventional powertrains. Accordingly, there have been various research
   topics on architectures of hybrid power systems to further improve the
   system performance ability and sizing optimization for the packaging and
   production cost reduction. In this study, a novel multimode power split
   hybrid architecture has been suggested, which is based on multiple
   driving modes such as input- and output-power split and parallel hybrid
   modes in order to achieve fuel efficiency improvement and sizing
   optimization. The performance ability and sizing aspects of the invented
   system have been analyzed in comparison with Toyota Hybrid System (THS),
   which is a kind of typical power split hybrid architecture. The fuel
   efficiency of the suggested system has been compared by a
   backward-facing simulation with Dynamic Programming (DP) for
   representative driving test cycles from Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA). In terms of the component sizing, the maximum torque and speed
   variation trends of motors have been analyzed according to the velocity

Abstract = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging strategies offer charging plans for
   gridable electric vehicles (GEVs), targeting at offloading the GEV
   charging loads from the electric power systems. However, designing an
   effective and efficient online V2V charging strategy with optimal energy
   utilization remains an open issue. In this chapter, a price control
   based semi-distributed online V2V charging strategy is put forward for
   an energy swapping station. Specifically, through electricity price
   control, GEVs are stimulated to participate in V2V energy transactions
   by offering high revenues for the discharging GEVs and low cost for the
   charging GEVs. The Oligopoly game theory and Lagrange duality
   optimization techniques are leveraged to solve the formulated optimal
   V2V charging problems. Simulation are conducted to demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed V2V charging strategy.},

Title = {Power Flow Analysis Using Deep Neural Networks in Three-Phase Unbalanced
   Smart Distribution Grids},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {29959-29970},
Abstract = {Most power systems' approaches are currently tending towards stochastic
   and probabilistic methods due to the high variability of renewable
   sources and the stochastic nature of loads. Conventional power flow (PF)
   approaches such as forward-backward sweep (FBS) and Newton-Raphson
   require a high number of iterations to solve non-linear PF equations
   making them computationally very intensive. PF is the most important
   study performed by utility, required in all stages of the power system,
   especially in operations and planning. This paper discusses the
   applications of deep learning (DL) to predict PF solutions for
   three-phase unbalanced power distribution grids. Three deep neural
   networks (DNNs); Radial Basis Function Network (RBFnet), Multi-Layer
   Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are proposed
   in this paper to predict PF solutions. The strength of the proposed DNN
   models over the traditional iterative-based PF solvers is that these
   models can capture the nonlinear relationships in PF calculations to
   accurately predict the solutions. The PF problem is formulated as a
   multi-output regression model where two or more output values are
   predicted based on the inputs. The training and testing data are
   generated through the OpenDSS-MATLAB COM interface. These methods are
   completely data-driven where the training relies on reducing the
   mismatch at each node without the need for the knowledge of the system.
   The novelty of the proposed methodology is that the models can
   accurately predict the PF solutions for the unbalanced distribution
   grids with mutual coupling and are robust to different R/X ratios,
   topology changes as well as generation and load variability introduced
   by the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric
   vehicles (EVs). To test the efficacy of the DNN models, they are applied
   to IEEE 4-node and 123-node test cases, and the American Electric Power
   (AEP) feeder model. The PF results for RBFnet, MLP, and CNN models are
   discussed in this paper which demonstrate that all three DNN models
   provide highly accurate results in predicting PF solutions.},

Abstract = {In recent years, aiming to reduce the metropolitan air pollution caused
   by fossil fuel-powered vehicles, the electrification of transportation,
   such as electric vehicles (EVs) and electric buses (EBs), has attracted
   great attention from the automobile industry, academia, and public
   transportation. EBs, driven by decarbonized electricity, can reduce the
   air pollution and noise level. Besides, they can also recover
   electricity from regenerative braking. Recent years have witnessed
   continuous works on the topics of EB energy storage, power management,
   and charging scheduling. In this review, we have comprehensively
   surveyed three primary parts: important components; existing research
   topics; and open issues of EBs. Specifically, we first introduce the
   important components of EBs, including energy storage systems,
   powertrains, interleaving elements and electric motors, and driving
   cycles. Then, we review the existing research topics of EBs, including
   the energy storage system sizing, power/energy management, range remedy
   methods, charging design/scheduling, and trial projects. At last,
   extending from existing literatures, we further propose the future
   research opportunities and ongoing challenges, such as extending EV
   related research to EBs, EB charging demand modeling, and EB impact on

Title = {Stochastic scenario-based generation scheduling in industrial microgrids},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Industrial parks are forming industrial microgrids (IMGs) with
   factories, distributed energy resources, electric loads, heat loads, and
   combined heat and power systems as well as renewable distributed energy
   resources and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Generation scheduling
   (GS) in IMGs is affected by the stochastic behavior of electric and heat
   loads due to outages of production processes or production lines and the
   uncertainties in solar irradiance and combined heat and power systems.
   This paper presents a stochastic scenario-based GS framework to consider
   uncertainties in an IMG coordinated with PEV charging. Although the
   scenario-based methods are usually very time consuming, this paper shows
   that their applications in IMGs will not significantly increase the
   calculation time. The proposed formulation guaranties that occurrence of
   each condition of uncertainty will not affect the PEV activities. An IMG
   with 12 factories, photovoltaic generations, and 6 types of electric
   vehicles with different battery sizes is considered and simulated. The
   main contributions are (1) a new stochastic GS problem formulation to
   minimize the cost of IMGs while fully charging all PEVs within their
   requested periods considering the network security, factories, and PEV
   constraints; (2) changing the nonlinear constraints to linear forms
   suitable for scenario-based optimization; and (3) considering the
   stochastic behavior of electric loads without requiring any data about
   their internal process in each factory.},

Abstract = {This article presents models and algorithms to simultaneously solve both
   the long-term grid planning and the distributed energy resource
   scheduling optimization problem for medium voltage grids. An emphasis is
   on evaluation of electric vehicle scheduling and demand side management.
   The main benefit of this new simultaneous optimization approach is that
   it converges towards a global optimum by considering not only
   infrastructure investments but also energy cost changes due to
   scheduling measures as for example curtailment or demand side
   management. The article firstly analyzes degrees of freedom in grid
   planning and in scheduling to derive models. The sections thereafter
   present the algorithm for simultaneous optimization. It integrates a
   fast scheduling optimization into a meta-heuristic grid-planning
   algorithm. The grid-planning algorithm uses Delaunay triangulation and
   an ant colony systems approach. The scheduling optimization combines
   dynamic programming and a fast heuristic to consider grid constraints.
   The last section presents exemplary results and illustrates effects of
   different regulatory regimes on costs. Results suggest that market-based
   scheduling will prevail due to energy cost-savings. However, purely
   market-based scheduling is unattractive when grid costs are considered.
   Distribution system operators can reduce long-term grid costs
   significantly, if they may perform demand side management.},

Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {59-67},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The introduction of electric vehicles and photovoltaics is changing the
   residential electricity consumption. Distribution network operators
   (DNO) are investing in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to
   enable cost reduction through smart grid applications. The DNO also
   benefits from the additional measurement data the AMI gives for the
   network planning process. The availability of AMI data can be limited by
   the cost of communication and by privacy concerns. To determine the
   social welfare of an AMI, the economic gains should be estimated. For
   the planning of the low voltage (LV) network, a method for determining
   the value of an AMI still needs to be developed. Therefore, a planning
   methodology which allows various levels of measurement data availability
   has been developed. By applying this approach the value of different
   levels of AMI from an LV-network planning perspective can be determined.
   To illustrated the application of this approach a case study for the
   LV-network of a Dutch DNO is performed. The results show that an
   increase in measurement data can lead to (sic)49-254 lower LV-network
   reinforcement costs. A detailed analysis of the results shows that
   already 50\% of the possible cost reduction can be achieved if only 65\%
   of the households have AMI data available. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Abstract = {The increasingly widespread utilization enables plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEVs) to provide ancillary service and support economic and
   secure operation of power systems. This paper proposes a novel model to
   optimize day-ahead spinning reserve requirement (SRR) considering PEVs'
   contribution in providing operating reserve. Based on the probabilistic
   criteria, the cost of expected energy supplied by PEV (EESEV) is
   formulated. The costs of reserves from thermal generators and PEVs as
   well as expected energy not supplied (EENS) are considered together to
   determine optimal SRR. The post-contingency PEV reaction time is taken
   into account in the formation of EENS and EESEV. The capacities of PEV
   interruptible charging demand and vehicle to grid service are
   calculated, respectively, under the conditions of both immediate
   charging and smart charging strategies. The effects of PEVs on system
   SRR quantification, unit commitment are comprehensively analyzed using
   IEEE reliability test system. Numerical results systematically
   demonstrate the effectiveness of PEVs' participation on the reduction of
   operation costs and the improvement of power system reliability.

Abstract = {A power flow analysis under different electric vehicle (EV) load models
   based on the modified backward and forward sweep method is presented.
   Voltage-dependent loads (VDLs) were used to analyze the total power loss
   and load voltage deviation (LVD) under different EV load models and the
   general load of the electrical power system. The VDL was defined in the
   backward stage where the voltage ratio was between bus voltages per
   nominal voltage. The IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system was selected
   to be the test system. The EV penetration level was defined as 26.88\%
   compared to the base case of constant power (P). The simulation results
   showed the impact levels from EV load models to the grid based on the
   traditional method, with impact levels from high to low being for
   polynomial load (EVI), constant current load (EVIII), and VDL (EVII)
   models, respectively. In particular, the highest impact for EVI was in
   scenario 4 (D), where the total active power loss, total reactive power
   loss, and LVD were 3.45\%, 3.47\%, and 3.36\%, respectively. Therefore,
   the EV load model was one important factor to select for solving the
   power flow of the grid. Moreover, the position and size of the EV load
   could be considered in the optimal condition for reducing the impact to
   the grid. However, energy management will become a key challenge for
   supporting the high penetration of EVs in the near future.},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-74},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The optimum size and operation of virtual power plants (VPPs) are
   essential for sustainable green power systems in modern society.
   Renewable energy (mainly wind and solar) is intermittent and
   non-dispatchable. The aggregator of available energy storage systems and
   controllable loads, including heating, cooling, EV charging/discharging,
   etc., can mitigate those issues in the VPP framework and maintain system
   balance. The VVP platform's wind speed, solar radiation, and load demand
   are highly dynamic. Without intelligent coordination, it is impossible
   to determine the optimal size of the resources with minimum operation
   cost. An overestimate of resources suffers from unnecessary excess
   capital cost, which might not be feasible. On the other hand, an
   underestimate of resources builds an unreliable VPP. It is a
   multi-objective complex problem considering the minimization of capital
   and operation costs as objectives, subject to many constraints,
   including net zero emission. Moreover, an intelligent energy management
   system (EMS) is deployed considering present and near future dynamic
   forecasted demand profile, state of charge (SoC) of storage, and power
   availability from renewables for reliability, and maintains net zero
   energy and emission. All the dispatch and transaction communications in
   VPP are committed to using blockchain. This paper uses an intelligent
   multi-objective strategy to design and optimize a generalized VPP model.
   Historical wind speed, solar radiation, and load profiles over a long
   period are used as inputs for the model. An intelligent energy
   management system for the dispatch of resources is carried out. Results
   will show that the proposed method can build an effective VPP
   considering costs, emissions, efficiency, and reliability.},

Abstract = {With its popularisation, electric vehicle (EV) has been part of the
   important load of smart grid. The analysis on charging demands of EVs is
   the basis of the study of influences on power grid and charging
   infrastructures planning. Charging demand calculation is based on the
   precise analysis on the driving law of users. This study proposes a
   method based on the stochastic simulation of trip chain to solve the
   existing problem. First, the concept and characteristic variables (trip
   start time, driving time, parking duration, driving distance and trip
   purpose) of trip chain are introduced. Second, the probability
   distribution models of these variables are established considering their
   correlative relationships. Third, using Monte Carlo method, the complete
   trip chains are simulated, and then the spatial-temporal distributions
   of charging demands are calculated. Finally, based on the National
   household trip survey data, and according to the proposed method,
   charging demands in different areas are studied. The results show that
   the proposed method can accurately simulate the driving law of users and
   reflect spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of charging
   demands, and different charging scenarios will lead to different forms
   of charging demand distribution, which will exert different impacts on

Title = {ARIMA-based decoupled time series forecasting of electric vehicle
   charging demand for stochastic power system operation},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Large-scale utilization of electric vehicles (EVs) affects the total
   electricity demand considerably. Demand forecast is usually designed for
   the seasonally changing load patterns. However, with the high
   penetration of EVs, daily charging demand makes traditional forecasting
   methods less accurate. This paper presents an autoregressive integrated
   moving average (ARIMA) method for demand forecasting of conventional
   electrical load (CEL) and charging demand of EV (CDE) parking lots
   simultaneously. Our EV charging demand prediction model takes daily
   driving patterns and distances as an input to determine the expected
   charging load profiles. The parameters of the ARIMA model are tuned so
   that the mean square error (MSE) of the forecaster is minimized. We
   improve the accuracy of ARIMA forecaster by optimizing the integrated
   and auto-regressive order parameters. Furthermore, due to the different
   seasonal and daily pattern of CEL and CDE, the proposed decoupled demand
   forecasting method provides significant improvement in terms of error
   reduction. The impact of EV charging demand on the accuracy of the
   proposed load forecaster is also analyzed in two approaches: (1)
   integrated forecaster for CEL + CDE, and (2) decoupled forecaster that
   targets CEL and CDE independently. The forecaster outputs are used to
   formulate a chance-constrained day-ahead scheduling problem. The
   numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed forecaster and
   its influence on the stochastic power system operation. (C) 2016

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {145},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles and roof-top
   solar panels have become increasingly popular and essential components
   of power distribution systems. However, their growth poses significant
   challenges to system operation, such as bidirectional power flow,
   intermittent power generation, increased peak demand, and unexpected
   frequency/voltage fluctuation. To tackle these challenges, we developed
   a vehicle-to -grid model, which incorporated dynamic electric vehicles
   usages, such as driving times, driving distance, and
   charging/discharging locations. The machine learning method of principal
   component analysis and XGBoost were used to develop the solar energy
   prediction model. We also developed a novel unit commitment model to
   coordinate and aggregate the distributed energy resources in power
   generation economic dispatch. Electric vehicle charging was used as
   elastic demand and electric vehicle discharging was used as power
   generation sources. The solar energy was considered as a negative load.
   Simulation results showed that uncontrolled electric vehicle charging
   and solar energy could negatively impact the power systems. For example,
   the load ramping rate was increased by 384\%. Simulation results also
   showed that the proposed models could mitigate the negative impact and
   improve energy efficiency. For example, the peak demand, load ramping
   rate and average generation cost were reduced by 21\%, 79\%, and 27\%.},

Abstract = {To improve the energy efficiency and driving condition adaptability of
   pure electric vehicles (EVs) in a complex traffic environment,
   simulation conditions that can dynamically update traffic information
   based on measured data were designed. Next, to increase the pure EV's
   driving range, an energy efficient optimal control framework based on
   dynamic traffic information flow was proposed, which includes the
   traffic information layer, the target planning layer, and the prediction
   and control layer. In the traffic information layer, the vehicle
   receives and updates the traffic information data. The time-domain
   information and distance domain information are converted in the target
   planning layer and the optimal state-of-charge (SOC) reference
   trajectory is planned through the remote cloud computing system. The
   traffic information is predicted in the prediction and control layer,
   and an SOC scroll tracking control method is proposed to continuously
   control the power system to achieve the goal of optimal energy
   consumption and economic driving. Finally, under a variety of real road
   simulation conditions with dynamic traffic information, we verify that
   the economic performance of the proposed control framework is equivalent
   to that of the one based on dynamic programming algorithms and has the

Title = {Optimal Planning of Multiple Distributed Generating Units and Storage in
   Active Distribution Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {55234-55244},
Abstract = {Traditionally, the energy supply in off-grid communities has relied on
   diesel generating units based microgrids (MGs) but global environmental
   concerns and advancements in renewable energy technology are pushing for
   the transformation of these systems into renewable-based MGs. This
   transformation is a more complex hybrid system, with dispatchable and
   non-dispatchable resources, and requires novel planning and design tools
   to ensure the security of supply in the future. This paper presents a
   methodology that jointly optimizes the capacities and locations of
   dispatchable and non-dispatchable distributed generating units and
   battery energy storage system employed in a stand-alone MG serving
   conventional residential and electric vehicle charging load. The complex
   dual optimization problem is solved innovatively in two sequential
   steps. In the first step, the capacities of solar photovoltaic panels,
   wind turbines, battery energy storage system, and diesel generator are
   determined without actually considering the system design itself. While
   in the second step, a novel and simple methodology is developed which
   determines the sub-optimal capacities of distributed generation units
   along with their actual locations in the distribution system. To
   determine the optimal locations of distributed generation units, we
   defined a novel factor, losses-voltage-factor (LVF), which ensures
   reduced losses and better voltage quality. The proposed methodology
   gives a robust design that not only results in reduced losses and better
   voltage quality but also have higher reliability. The proposed technique
   is very practical, which can easily be applied for the planning and
   design of the practical active distribution networks.},

Abstract = {Existing literature on planning for electric vehicle charging station
   (EVCS) fails to consider uncertain factors in power systems, such as
   load fluctuations and the impact of EV integration. Consequently, using

   to maximize capital gains on investment costs of EVCS, minimize yearly

   the DSVS index. To simplify the problem, we use the super efficiency
   data envelopment analysis (SEDEA) method to determine objective weights
   and transform the multiobjective optimization problem into a
   single-objective one. Finally, we jointly solve the model using the

Abstract = {Trend-setting countries have promoted or even employed an increased
   number of electric vehicles (EVs) and other distributed energy resources
   (DERs) in their power systems. This development has triggered new and
   increasing challenges in the distribution system planning and operation,
   whereby the distribution systems must adapt to the increased share of

   support the grid by providing several local and global power- and

   of the services potentially available from EVs for distribution systems,
   referred to as EV distribution system services (EV-DSS). A detailed
   description of recent services and approaches is given, and an
   assessment of the maturity of EV-DSS is provided. Moreover, challenges
   and prospects for future research are identified, considering key
   topics, such as the design of the market framework, economic assessment,
   battery degradation, and the impacts of the transmission system operator
   service provision by EVs on distribution networks. Thus, this paper
   offers a tool for stakeholders concerning services available from EVs

Abstract = {Coupling power-transportation systems may enhance the resilience of
   power grids by engaging energy-carrying mobile entities such as electric
   vehicles (EVs), truck-mounted energy storage systems, and Data Centers
   (DCs), which can shift the computing loads among their network. In
   practice, the co-optimization problem for power-transportation systems
   can be overly complicated due to a great deal of uncertainty and many
   decision variables rooted in the EV population and mobile energy
   storage. Another challenge is the heterogeneity in terms of size and
   supporting capability due to various types of such mobile entities. This
   work aims to facilitate power-transportation co-optimization by
   proposing and formalizing the concept of Circulating Loads (CirLoads) to
   generalize these spatial-temporal dispatchable entities. With the new
   concept, the stochastic process of CirLoads' movement is introduced
   using Brownian particles for the first time. Such novel particle
   motion-based modeling for EVs can reflect their stochastic behaviors
   over time without requiring exact data of EVs. The distributions of
   CirLoads are further aggregated with Gaussian Mixture Models to reduce
   the dimensions. Based on this aggregated model, a co-optimization

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {161},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The carbon neutrality policy aiming for net zero carbon emissions has
   led to a significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources
   (RES) globally. However, due to their uncertain nature, RES can cause
   imbalances in power demand. Recently, Power-to-X (P2X) station
   technology has gained attention as a solution to the uncertainties of
   RES and as a means to enhance the capacity and efficiency of RES
   operations. P2X stations can be utilized when power demand imbalances
   occur due to the uncertain output of RES or when the power system cannot
   accommodate the power supply from RES due to various stability issues.
   Specifically, when supply disruptions occur in the power system due to
   RES uncertainties, P2X stations contribute to preventing RES curtailment
   by supplying power to electric vehicle (EV) fuel sources, producing heat
   using electric heat pumps (EHP), or producing hydrogen using
   electrolyzers (ELZ), thus improving the uncertain financial benefits for
   independent power producers (IPP). This paper proposes a mixed-integer
   linear programming (MILP) based chance-constrained two-stage stochastic
   optimization (CCTS) approach to address imbalances in power demand from
   RES and to enhance the profitability of IPP by finding the optimal
   planning and operational solutions for P2X stations. The proposed method
   provides hierarchical level results, demonstrating that economic
   benefits can increase by up to 60.2\% with the application of P2X
   stations and that curtailed energy from RES can be reduced by up to
   76.5\%. The proposed methodology is also validated for its superior
   performance by being compared with both the non-linear stochastic chance
   constraint method and the stochastic method.},

Title = {Electric Vehicle and Photovoltaic Power Scenario Generation under
   Extreme High-Temperature Weather},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the intensification of global warming, extreme
   weather has become more frequent, intensifying the uncertainty of new
   energy output and load power, and seriously affecting the safe operation
   of power systems. Scene generation is an effective method to solve the
   uncertainty problem of stochastic planning of integrated systems of new
   energy generation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scenario generation
   and scenario reduction model of photovoltaic (PV) output and electric
   vehicle (EV) load power under extreme weather based on the copula
   function. Firstly, the non-parametric kernel density estimation method
   is used to fit a large number of sample data. The kernel density
   estimation expressions of PV and EV powers under extreme weather
   conditions are obtained and the corresponding goodness of fit tests are
   carried out. Then, a variety of joint distribution models based on the
   copula function are established to judge the goodness of fit of each
   model, and the optimal copula function is selected as the joint
   probability distribution function by combining the Kendall and Spearman
   correlation coefficients of each model. Finally, the optimal copula
   joint probability distribution is used to generate PV and EV power
   scenarios. The data of extremely hot weather in a certain province were
   selected for an example analysis. The results show that the output
   scenario obtained conforms to the correlation under this extreme
   weather, and has higher accuracy in reflecting the actual PV output and
   load power in this province under this extreme weather, which can
   provide a reference for reliability analyses of power systems and power
   grid planning.},

Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Power outages cost billions of dollars every year and jeopardise the
   lives of hospital patients. Traditionally, power distribution system
   takes a long time to recover after a major blackout, due to its top-down
   operation strategy. New technologies in modern distribution systems
   bring opportunities and challenges to distribution system restoration.
   As fast response energy resources, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
   (PHEVs) can accelerate the load pickup by compensating the imbalance
   between available generation and distribution system load. This study
   provides a bottom-up restoration strategy to use PHEVs for reliable load
   pickup and faster restoration process. The optimisation problem of
   finding load pickup sequence to maximise restored energy is formulated
   as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Moreover, the
   coordination between transmission and distribution restoration is
   developed to efficiently restore the entire system back to normal
   operating conditions. Simulation results on one 100-feeder test system
   demonstrate the efficiency of MILP-based restoration strategy and the
   benefit from PHEVs to restore more energy in given restoration time. The
   proposed restoration strategy has great potential to facilitate system
   operators to achieve efficient system restoration plans. It also
   provides incentives to deploy a large amount of PHEVs to improve system
   resiliency.},

Title = {Optimization of sizing and energy management in hybrid energy storage
   systems for transient suppression in ship power systems under adverse

Abstract = {In adverse sea conditions, the ship Integrated Power System (IPS) will
   be subjected to significant load fluctuations, which has a serious
   impact on the safety of ship sailing and the power quality of shipboard
   electrical network. In this paper, the potential performance of Hybrid
   Energy Storage System (HESS), consisting of the battery and
   supercapacitor, in mitigating fluctuations in shipboard electrical
   network has been investigated based on the simulation model. To achieve
   a cooperative control among the three-source powertrains (i.e., the
   generation set system, Li-ion battery, and supercapacitor), a power
   distribution strategy is proposed. Considering that the power
   distribution and capacity sizing of HESS are highly related to each
   other, a multi-objective joint optimization method based on
   Multi-objective pelican optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the
   optimal number of Li-ion battery and supercapacitor and the optimal
   power distribution strategy among the three-source powertrain for
   adverse sea conditions. The results indicate that the HESS can
   effectively mitigate fluctuations in frequency and voltage of AC bus,
   which are caused by the power supply side and/or the load side. Compared
   to the original IPS (without HESS), the fluctuations amplitude of
   frequency and voltage for the proposed IPS with optimal HESS are reduced
   by 63.0\% and 74.5\% in adverse sea conditions, effectively improving
   the electricity quality and safety of the ship. Moreover, compared to
   traditional optimization methods, the investment cost and installation
   space for the proposed IPS with optimal HESS are reduced by 53.9\% and
   54.2\% respectively.},

Abstract = {Promotion of charging facilities (CFs) can ameliorate range anxiety and
   facilitate long-distance travel by electric vehicles (EVs). In this
   context, a multistage low-carbon EV CFs planning model is proposed in
   this paper for the coupled transportation and power systems. This model
   not only takes into account the construction costs of newly-built CFs
   and their adverse impacts on the distribution system, but also considers
   the carbon emissions of CFs and the penalty due to the inconvenience for
   EVs to be recharged. In addition, a rational travel route choice model
   is significantly important to accurately evaluate the service capability
   of CFs to be constructed and thereby to obtain an optimal CF planning
   result. Therefore, a novel travel route choice model developed in this
   work allows EV drivers to take detours according to the CF locations to
   charge their EVs multiple times and then finish their trips. Carbon
   emission flow (CEF) model is innovatively employed to precisely
   calculate CFs' carbon emission amount from the perspective of
   consumption side. Subsequently, uncertainties involved in CF planning,
   i.e., distribution and growth rate of traffic flow and electric load,
   popularity of different types of EVs, as well as location of the
   connected node of clean electricity, are fully considered to obtain a
   robust CF planning scheme that can achieve a good performance in the
   current stage and exhibit robustness for the uncertainties in the future
   stage. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed model. The impacts of future carbon price
   and EV cruising range on the planning results are also comprehensively
   evaluated.},

Title = {Multi-Objective Approach for Optimal Sizing and Placement of EVCS in
   Distribution Networks With Distributed Rooftop PV in Metropolitan City},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {40883-40898},
Abstract = {The optimal sizing and location of electric vehicle charging station
   (EVCS) integrated with distributed generation (DG) in the distribution
   network are the subject of this study. In modern electric power systems,
   the integration of EVCS and DG must be carefully planned. Inappropriate
   sizing and location of EVCS can cause network overload, increase power
   losses, and allow for voltage variations outside the standard. This
   study adopts a reference distribution network that is representative of
   a typical business distribution network in a metropolitan city in
   Indonesia. To resolve the issue of determining the size and location of
   EVCS, the hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm algorithm
   (HGAMSSA) optimization method with multi-objective function is
   implemented. There are three scenarios used when determining the size
   and placement of EVCS. In the first scenario, the EVCS comprises
   chargers at levels 1, 2, and 3, with DG integration. In the second
   scenario, EVCS is comprised of level 2 and level 3, with DG integration.
   While in the third scenario, EVCS only consists of level 3 chargers with
   DG integration. The simulation results indicate that network utilization
   can be optimized at 79.00\%, 75.53\%, and 76.37\% when electric cars
   (EV) operate in grid to vehicle (G2V) mode, compared to a base load of
   29.46\%. In vehicle to grid (V2G) mode, the energy supplied by the
   electric vehicle (EV) via the EVCS is 0.91 MWh. Additionally, the
   distribution network receives 10.036 MWh of electricity from rooftop
   photovoltaic (PV).},

Abstract = {New entities and ways of operating electrical power systems have
   emerged. An example of this is the microgrid (MG), which can be
   described as a set of power generation units, energy storage systems
   (ESSs) and demands that can operate as a single set, in order to
   optimize their energy resources. Moreover, the recent growth in the use
   of electric vehicles (EVs) in transportation systems has created new
   challenges to electrical power systems. This article proposes a
   two-stage stochastic energy scheduling model for an MG to set up the
   day-ahead optimal decision in the first stage. Real-time operations,
   depending on wind and photovoltaic solar power, baseload demand and EV
   demand variability, are taken into account in the second stage. The
   proposed model considers conventional generators and alternating current
   (AC) linearized power flow constraints. Besides, a detailed ESS
   operation is considered, including degradation costs, and nonlinear
   charging/discharging as well as efficiency variation dependent of state
   of charge (SOC), for lead-acid and lithium-ion technologies. EV demand
   behavior is generated by probability-based algorithms that use the Monte
   Carlo method to perform their simulations, which are based on data of
   initial SOC, plugin/out times, type of EVs, and chargers. Finally, the
   proposed model is successfully validated with an IEEE-37 bus system. The
   results support the superiority of the proposed model over existing
   works, showing significant variations in battery bank (BB) operation.
   The computational time is similar to previous works, despite adding new
   constraints that increase the complexity.},

Abstract = {Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are ideal
   technologies for highway transport to achieve zero emissions, and their
   widespread adoption in highway networks require sufficient available
   hybrid refueling stations (HRSs). However, existing planning models for
   HRSs tend to focus on the interior of the city, the research on the
   planning of HRSs in highway networks, as well as the optimal allocation
   of hydrogen that can exist between HRSs is usually ignored. This article
   proposed a collaborative planning method for HRSs in highway networks
   that included photovoltaic (PV) and hydrogen allocation. First, based on
   the Floyd algorithm and the Monte Carlo algorithm, this article proposed
   a charging demand simulation method for HRSs in highway networks. Then
   we proposed an HRSs energy allocation method using hydrogen as backup
   mobile energy which aims to realize the cross-space energy dispatch of
   multi-site PV power generation and improve the energy supply reliability
   of the HRSs. Finally, based on the above research, considering the
   safety constraints of the power system along the highway network and the
   installed capacity constraints of the PV power generation system, we
   proposed an HRSs planning model including electric-hydrogen conversion
   devices and storage systems. This method minimizes the transportation
   cost of hydrogen by rationally planning the amount of hydrogen tube
   trailers (HTTs) and transportation routes, realizes cross-space energy
   scheduling of multi-site PV power generation, and thereby improving the
   energy supply reliability of HRSs and the consumption rate of PV power
   generation. The case study indicates that compared with the traditional
   method, the planning method proposed in this article reduces the
   operating cost by 32.5\%, and the total cost decreases by 8.5\%, with
   the PV power consumption rate along the highway network also improved to
   a certain extent.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and the deployment of fast
   charging infrastructures bring considerable impacts on the planning and
   operation of power systems. Integrating photovoltaic (PV) and energy
   storage system (ESS) with fast charging station (FCS) can alleviate the
   negative impacts and bring benefits to both power system operation and
   charging service provider. In this paper, an integrated procedure is
   proposed for the charging service provider to optimally plan fast
   charging stations integrated with PV and ESS in urban area, while taking
   the influence of its competitors, EV users' decision-making psychology,
   the uncertainties of charging demand and PV power output into
   consideration. Firstly, a charging demand estimationmethod based on
   average travel speed is presented. Secondly, a stochastic dynamic user
   choice equilibrium (SDUCE) model and its solution algorithm based on
   method of successive averages (MSA) are proposed. The model considers
   the key factors influencing the charging decision of EV users as well as
   the uncertainty of their perceptions of utility values. In addition, the
   time-varying queuing time and the temporal coupling among EVs arriving
   at a charging station in different time periods are also considered.
   Thirdly, based on the equilibrium model, a multi-scenario benefit
   maximization model is built from the perspective of charging service
   provider, and solved by genetic algorithm. Finally, a distributionally
   robust optimization (DRO) planning model based on the Wasserstein-metric
   is formulated to determine the capacities of PV and ESS. The proposed
   planning method is tested using real traffic data of ShenzhenCity.
   Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

   Resilience in Power Distribution Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {60470-60491},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hierarchical optimization framework to
   enhance power distribution network resilience against extreme events by
   incorporating electric boats (E-Boats) as complementary assets to
   electric vehicles (EVs). Unlike EVs reliant on potentially compromised
   roadways, E-Boats navigate unaffected waterways, offering superior
   resilience during disaster response in regions with rivers and canals.
   The approach employs a two-phase methodology evaluated on a modified
   IEEE 123-node test feeder with actual infrastructure data, enabling
   large-scale integration of non-pre-determined EVs/E-Boats. Phase-I
   emphasizes proactive planning and anticipatory optimization, leveraging
   extensive data integration and a developed exchange architecture
   enabling efficient EV/E-Boat distribution through novel selection and
   pairing algorithms. Phase-II focuses on adaptive restoration and
   coordination optimization by employing sophisticated model layers. These
   include advanced EV and E-Boat dispatch models that use changing
   geospatial data to approximate motion conditions and
   charging/discharging requirements, enabling energy-efficient and
   optimized dispatch. Detailed simulations with comprehensive performance
   analysis demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superiority in achieving
   optimal solutions within shorter computational times. This work presents
   an effective solution for enhancing power network resilience using a
   combined EV/E-Boat network with geospatial data for EV and E-Boat
   locations, state-of-charge updates, and adaptive path optimization
   algorithms. Results highlight faster restoration, minimized costs, and
   reduced energy consumption.},

   and coordinated aggregated Plug-In Electric Vehicle (PEV) fleets. These
   new resources could be a merit for the power system provided that they
   are employed correctly and in coordination with the rest of the system.
   The SCUC is where DRPs and PEVs could be optimally addressed to exploit
   their full potential.
   This paper tackles the problem of SCUC in the presence of DRPs and
   aggregated PEV fleets. The objective is to lessen the operation cost
   provided that all constraints are satisfied. Different constraints
   including those related to the system, units, transmission system, DRPs,
   and PEVs as well as the security constraints are taken into
   consideration. The SCUC is modeled as a two-stage stochastic
   mixed-integer programming problem and an appropriate model of PEVs is
   derived to facilitate the integration of these resources into the grid
   while considering their charging and discharging characteristics as well
   as efficiency. Moreover, a suitable model of DRPs is introduced in this
   study based on the concept of price elasticity of demand.
   The proposed approach is practiced over the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test
   System (RTS) to analyze the effect of the smart grid on SCUC. Obtained
   results demonstrate that with proper deployment of DRPs and PEVs the
   operation cost could be lessened while the security of the system is
   improved. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {With rapid increase of distributed solar power generation and direct
   current (DC) based loads such as data centers, electric vehicles (EVs),
   and DC household appliances, the development trend of the power system
   is changed from conventional alternate current (AC) to DC. Traditional
   AC power systems can scarcely meet the development demand of new DC
   trends, especially since both the generation side and load side are
   comprised of DC-based electronic power components. With this background,
   low voltage direct current supply and utilization system (LVDCSUS) has
   attracted more and more attention for its great advantages over an AC
   grid to overcome challenges in operation, reliability, and energy loss
   in renewable energy connection, DC load power utilization and a number
   of other aspects. However, the definition of the LVDCSUS is still not
   clear even though many demonstration projects have been put into
   planning and operation. In order to provide a clear description of
   LVDCSUS, first, the characteristics of LVDCSUS are illustrated in this
   paper to show the advance of the LVDCSUS. Second, the potential
   application scenarios of LVDCSUS are presented in this paper. Third,
   application of LVDCSUS technologies and some demonstration projects in
   China are introduced. Besides the development of the LVDCSUS, key
   technologies, including but not limited to planning and design, voltage
   levels, control strategies, and key equipment of LVDCSUS, are discussed
   in this paper. Finally, future application areas and the research
   orientations of LVDCSUS are analyzed.},

Abstract = {Direct Load Control (DLC) is a demand response strategy in which
   customers receive compensation from utilities in return for permitting
   them to regulate the operation of specific equipment. This paper
   analyzes the impacts of DLC programs on the transition to renewable
   energy within the European electricity system towards 2060. The study
   quantifies the achievable hourly potential for DLC across Europe in the
   residential sector. By implementing and developing a DLC module within
   the stochastic capacity expansion model EMPIRE, we investigate how
   costs, long-term investments, and long-term marginal prices are affected
   by residential DLC participation rates. The research utilizes a
   comprehensive DLC dataset, including ten appliances such as electric
   vehicles, heat pumps, refrigeration, and others. This dataset serves as
   the basis for creating four storylines to investigate the integration of
   these programs into the European electricity system. The results
   indicate that residential DLC programs have some impact on grid -battery
   deployment, PV plant penetration, and electricity prices. In the best
   -case scenario, involving ambitious participation of residential loads
   in DLC programs without compensation, cost savings are about 1\% versus
   not introducing DLC. The findings contribute to understanding the value
   of demand response programs in Europe, indicating that the savings they
   bring might not be sufficient to provide enough incentives or
   compensation for widespread participation in such programs. That is,
   from a long-term investment or capacity expansion perspective, it may
   not be worthwhile to soley include residential demand response in the
   planning of the electricity system.},

Abstract = {The overutilization of electric vehicles (EVs) has the potential to
   result in significant challenges regarding the reliability, contingency,
   and standby capabilities of traditional power systems. The utilization
   of renewable energy distributed generator (REDG) presents a potential
   solution to address these issues. By incorporating REDG, the reliance of
   EV charging power on conventional energy sources can be diminished,
   resulting in significant reductions in transmission losses and enhanced
   capacity within the traditional power system. The effective management
   of the REDG necessitates intelligent coordination between the available
   generation capacity of the REDG and the charging and discharging power
   of EVs. Furthermore, the utilization of EVs as a means of energy storage
   is facilitated through the integration of vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
   technology. Despite the importance of the V2G technology for EV owners
   and electric utility, it still has a slow progress due to the distrust
   of the revenue model that can encourage the EV owners and the electric
   utility as well to participate in V2G programs. This study presents a
   new wear model that aims to precisely assess the wear cost of EV
   batteries, resulting from their involvement in V2G activities. The
   proposed model seeks to provide EV owners with a precise understanding
   of the potential revenue they might obtain from participating in V2G
   programs, hence encouraging their active engagement in such initiatives.
   Various EV battery wear models are employed and compared. Additionally,
   this study introduces a novel method for optimal charging scheduling,
   which aims to effectively manage the charging and discharging patterns
   of EVs by utilizing a day-ahead pricing technique. This study presents a
   novel approach, namely, the gradual reduction of swarm size with the
   grey wolf optimization (GRSS-GWO) algorithm, for determining the optimal
   hourly charging/discharging power with short convergence time and the
   highest accuracy based on maximizing the profit of EV owners.},

Abstract = {Future power systems are expected to integrate large-scale stochastic

   resources, including renewable energy sources and electric vehicles

   of dispersed and distributed generation by offering supporting reserve
   while accommodating large-scale EV connection; the latter (load) also
   participating in storage provision. In this study, a local energy
   storage system (LESS) is proposed. The structure, requirement and
   optimal sizing of the LESS are discussed. Three operating modes are
   detailed, including: (i) storage pack management; (ii) normal operation;
   and (iii) contingency operation. The proposed LESS scheme is evaluated

Abstract = {This paper extensively models the interactions of emerging players in
   future power systems to analyze their impacts on electricity markets. To
   this end, renewable energy resources are modeled in such a way that wind
   power poses uncertainty on the supply side, and rooftop photovoltaics
   add uncertainty to the demand side. Moreover, both uncontrolled and
   controlled behaviors of individual electric vehicles (EV) in electricity
   markets arc addressed through a new EV model. Further, a comprehensive
   demand response model considering several customer-driven constraints is
   developed to undertake the practical constraints of customers. A
   stochastic market clearing formulation is presented to comprehensively
   account for the unique features of the given resources while evaluating
   their impacts. The numerical results clearly show the importance of such
   modeling in electricity markets to investigate the mutual impacts of
   emerging resources.},

Abstract = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are seen to be a step forward
   in transportation electrification, to replace internal combustion engine
   (ICE)-based conventional vehicles. However, to consider the

   This paper presents a novel controller based on fuzzy logic, which
   integrates an objective state-of-charge (SoC) for V2H application. The
   V2H capability is used when the PHEV is connected to the home to help
   the grid to meet the household loads during peak period. The SoC
   objective is the minimum SoC that the PHEV has to have when the driver
   connects the PHEV to the home. The proposed controller is applied on

Title = {Battery Health-Informed and Policy-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for
   EV-Facilitated Distribution Grid Optimal Policy},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Electric vehicles play a crucial role in modern active distribution
   system operation, owing to their flexibility and mobility. The joint
   optimization of power grid operation and EV scheduling is expected to
   achieve better decision-making for both power and transportation
   systems. However, such joint optimization can suffer from high
   computational complexity and a lack of information about the other
   system. One possible approach for the power system operator is to assume
   the charging/discharging pattern of the EV population and make dispatch
   decisions based on such estimated EV profiles. This practice results in
   grid-level policies. The problem arises as whether the EV population
   complies with and fulfills the grid-level policies is not easy to
   monitor. To address this issue, we further investigate and expand upon
   the innovative concept of grid facilitation for electric vehicles (EVs).
   A newly designed probabilistic incentive signal is introduced to assist
   in implementing grid policies. Correspondingly, we develop a deep
   reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for EV prosumer scheduling that
   effectively balances EV autonomy with the execution of grid policies.
   Cast as a demand response signal, the grid-level policy is capable of
   managing overall grid operation with the facilitation of individuals and
   decoupling the co-optimization of the operator and EV owner. For the DRL
   of the EV, the training reward considers both the EV operation cost and
   the grid facilitation incentive, featuring a dynamically shrinking EV
   battery's feasible operation range in terms of voltages and currents,
   and the health-informed reward. The policy-aware reward utilizes the
   Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify the gap between the actual EV
   power injection pattern and the system operator's assumption. Invalid
   action mask tricks are integrated to prevent infeasible actions for EVs.
   The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   framework and the facilitation effect of EV on system operation
   planning.},

Title = {Multi-objective techno-economic generation expansion planning to
   increase the penetration of distributed generation resources based on
   demand response algorithms},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {138},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Generation expansion planning in the power system is of particular
   importance. In traditional systems, invest-ment in the generation
   expansion was made by the electricity company, but with the
   restructuring in the electricity industry, the owners of different parts
   of the system submit their proposals to the independent system operator
   and the independent system operator chooses the optimal design. Slowly
   increasing energy production from renewable sources can pose challenges
   for the grid. Increasing the penetration of renewable resources due to
   uncertainty in their production can reduce network reliability and thus
   increase system costs. The investi-gation on generation expansion
   planning is a multifaceted issue (technical and economic) that has been
   analyzed in various aspects in recent years. In this study, a
   multidimensional structure of generation expansion planning based on
   increasing the penetration level of distributed generation resources
   (renewable and non-renewable) as well as the application of load
   management and demand response algorithms is proposed. The proposed
   model is scheduled based on two levels of primary and secondary
   development. In the primary, the development of generation and
   transmission based on large-scale power plants as well as solar and wind
   farms are presented. In the secondary, in order to reduce the power
   fluctuations caused by the distributed generation's units, non-
   stochastic power generation units such as micro turbines, gas turbines
   and combined heat and power have been utilized. To overcome the
   difficulties in solving the problem of hybrid and non-convergent
   mixed-integer problem, the adaptive particle swarm optimization has been
   hired. The simulation results indicate that in the second scenario,
   where the development of the generation expansion planning is based on
   the integration of distributed generation resources and power plants, it
   is more cost-effective. In addition to, these simulation results
   represent the accuracy of the proposed probabilistic method in planning
   of dynamic generation systems in order to estimate the probability
   density function and the optimal output variables in multi-objective
   techno- economic planning.},

   Numerical experiments with real-world data show that it has a
   significantly higher rate of feasible EV charging than several other

   employed to assess the feasibility condition of the algorithm. The

   another where the charging demand was optimized by the power system
   based on least cost. The results showed that additional capacity was
   required to meet the demand. For both scenarios, the least-cost capacity
   investment technologies chosen were the same, although the quantities
   differed. This indicates that the least-cost technology choice was
   robust against the charging profiles. The optimized charging profile led

Abstract = {This paper investigates the optimal configuration and control of

   In the case of any subproblem violations in the feasibility check of the

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {5986-6000},
Abstract = {Accelerated development of eco-friendly technologies, such as renewable
   energy (RE), smart grids, and electric transportation will shape the
   future of electric power generation and supply. The power consumption
   characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible
   and easily controllable, which will also affect the sizing of power
   generation system. This paper presents a methodology for the joint
   capacity optimization of a typical residential standalone microgrid (MG)
   employing RE sources, i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines
   (WTs), diesel generators (DGs), and battery energy storage system
   (BESS). The MG supplies a residential community load comprising of
   typical residential load plus electric vehicles (EVs) charging load. The
   realistic mathematical models of PV, WT, diesel generation system, BESS,
   and EV load are formulated to improve the capacity optimization
   methodology, which involves various realistic constraints associated
   with the RE sources, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load. The
   labyrinthine optimization problem is formulated and solved innovatively
   to 1) minimize the cost; 2) reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; and
   3) curtail dump energy. All three objectives have special significance
   in designing a standalone MG, for example, cost is related to the
   economics, GHG emissions deal with global warming, and dump energy is
   related to the stability and economics of the system. The optimization
   problem is solved for different possible combinations of PV, WT, DG, and
   BESS to determine the best possible combination to serve the load
   effectively and economically. In addition, the impact of load shifting
   on the sizes of distributed generators and BESS in terms of per-unit
   cost and GHG emissions is analyzed using the concept of controllable
   loads. This study could be assumed as a powerful roadmap for decision
   makers, analysts, and policy makers.},

   framework for solving the generation scheduling problem in IMGs by
   relaxing the time correlated constraints of the DOPE The relaxation is
   mathematically achieved by replacing the time-coupled constraints with
   their corresponding long term time averages. This will resolve the time
   coupling property of DOPF and results in a simpler solution approach.
   The relaxed DOPF problem can be solved in independent time periods while
   considering other constraints such as PEVs and security constraints of
   OPF as well as factories constraints. To examine the effectiveness of
   the proposed method, different simulation scenarios have been applied to
   an 18-bus IMG consisting of PEVs and 12 factories with electrical and
   thermal loads as well as combined heat and power systems.},

Abstract = {The battery swapping mode is a promising way for electric vehicles (EVs)
   to participate in power grid frequency regulation. However, the
   operation mechanism and the uncertainty management in the process still
   lack research. Aiming at this issue, this paper proposes a day-ahead
   bidding strategy for the battery swapping and charging system (BSCS)
   providing regulation reserve capacity in the ancillary service market.
   Firstly, a new BSCS-based regulation model is established. Then, an
   ambiguity set based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used to
   manage the uncertainty of regulation signals and battery swapping
   demands. Furthermore, a boundary expectation approach is proposed to
   turn the problem into robust optimization. Finally, after using the
   extreme scenario method (ESM) to generate extreme scenarios, a
   duality-free column-and-constraint generation (C\&CG) algorithm is
   employed to solve the problem. The case studies demonstrate that BSCS
   can provide economical and robust reserve capacity bidding plans in the
   day-ahead market with the proposed strategy. At the same time, the
   BSCS-based regulation service is simulated with the battery development
   trend in the future, and suggestions are given.},

Abstract = {With the development of smart grid, demand-side resources (DSR) will
   play an increasingly important role in the power balance of supply and

   some policy backgrounds, such as carbon emissions trading (CET), should

   construct a novel unit commitment (UC) model. This paper proposes a
   model that not only takes advantage of various resources on the demand
   side, such as electric vehicles, demand response, and distributed
   generation, but also reflects the effects of CET on generation schedule.
   Then, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is
   applied to solve the problem. In numerical studies, we analyze the
   impacts of DSR and CET on the results of UC, respectively. In addition,

Abstract = {The locations and sizes of plug-in electric vehicle fast-charging
   stations (PEVFCS) can affect traffic flow in the urban transportation

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although electric vehicles are considered a viable solution to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions, their uncoordinated charging could have
   adverse effects on power system operation. Nevertheless, the task of
   optimal electric vehicle charging scales unfavorably with the fleet size
   and the number of control periods, especially when distribution grid
   limitations are enforced. To this end, vehicle charging is first tackled
   using the recently revived Frank-Wolfe method. The novel decentralized
   charging protocol has minimal computational requirements from vehicle
   controllers, enjoys provable acceleration over existing alternatives,
   enhances the security of the pricing mechanism against data attacks, and
   protects user privacy. To comply with voltage limits, a
   network-constrained EV charging problem is subsequently formulated.
   Leveraging a linearized model for unbalanced distribution grids, the
   goal is to minimize the power supply cost while respecting critical
   voltage regulation and substation capacity limitations. Optimizing
   variables across grid nodes is accomplished by exchanging information
   only between neighboring buses via the alternating direction method of
   multipliers. Numerical tests corroborate the optimality and efficiency
   of the novel schemes.},

Abstract = {With the extensive integration of high-penetration renewable energy

   participating in the FR service is obtained under market mechanism. The

Abstract = {Vehicle-grid integration (VGI) is critical for the future of electric
   power systems, with decarbonization targets anticipating millions of
   electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. As EV adoption grows, charging
   demand-particularly during peak hours in cities-may place significant
   pressure on the electrical grid. Charging at high power, especially
   during the evening when most EVs are parked in residential areas, can
   lead to grid instability and increased costs. One promising solution is
   to leverage long-duration, low-power charging, which can align with
   typical user behavior and improve grid compatibility. This paper delves
   into how public slow charging stations (<7.4 kW) in metropolitan
   residential areas can alleviate grid pressures while fostering a host of
   additional benefits. We show that, with respect to a reference (22 kW
   infrastructure), such stations can increase EV user satisfaction by up
   to 20\%, decrease grid costs by 40\% owing to a peak load reduction of
   10 to 55\%, and provide six times the flexibility for energy markets.
   Cities can overcome the limitation of private garage scarcity with this
   charging approach, thus fostering the transition to EVs.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a planning model that can be used by an investor
   who would like to provide ancillary services (AS) to electricity
   markets. The proposed model helps the investor evaluate two potential
   options: aggregating distributed batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) or
   using a dedicated energy storage system (ESS). For EV aggregations in AS
   markets, the targeted EV fleet size, which is a function of energy
   tariff charged by the EV aggregator, is a key planning consideration. In
   the case of ESS, the physical size is the main planning consideration.
   Using the proposed model, the two options for maximizing the investor's
   long-term payoffs are analyzed and compared by assuming the same initial
   investment cost for both options. Accordingly, the investor's daily
   bidding strategy in AS markets is optimized for each case. The net
   present worth is used as the basis for comparing the two investment
   options, and sensitivity analyses are carried out to study the impact of
   planning and operation variables on the feasibility of the two options.

Abstract = {Increasing penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the power
   system makes a need to consider the impact of PEVs on the transmission
   expansion planning (TEP) studies especially for large-scale PEV parking
   lots. Modelling of PEVs (as vehicle to grid (V2G)) is highly dependent
   on the owner's behaviour. In this study, a systematic method based on
   multi-state Markov model is utilised to represent the uncertainty of
   V2G's presence. To investigate the impact of PEVs, a probabilistic TEP
   in the presence of V2Gs (P\_TEPV2G) is proposed. In the proposed TEP
   model, the objective function consists of the total line and risk costs
   (RCs). Moreover, the optimal place and capacity of PEV parking lots are
   considered as the decision variables. It is assumed that there is an
   electric vehicle fleet operator for the management of electric vehicles.
   Because P\_TEPV2G is a complex and non-linear optimisation problem, an
   improved cuckoo search algorithm (ICS) is utilised to effectively solve
   the problem. On the IEEE 24-bus system, simulation results show that the
   availability of the PEVs at the proper bus leads to decreasing RC and
   deferring construction of new transmission lines.},

Abstract = {In this paper an efficient algorithm for simultaneous scheduling of
   energy and primary reserve with the presence of smart electric vehicles
   in the system is discussed. It is proposed that the system operator uses
   the electric vehicles (EVs) as alternative resources of primary reserve
   in the power system. The proposed model deals with the effect of
   generation scheduling on the EV charging schedules and primary reserve
   capacities. In fact, the amount of primary reserve provided by EVs is
   highly related to the EV's charging schedules. Therefore, in this paper
   a smart charging algorithm is also proposed that is based on direct load
   control of EVs by the system operator. The proposed scheme would be
   applicable with the lowest intelligence level and will not impose extra
   investment cost to the EV owners. All the nonlinear constraints included
   in the primary reserve scheduling are linearized to be solvable by mixed
   integer linear programming method. A case study on IEEE RTS79 system
   with 30\% EV penetration is used to illustrate the feasibility and
   acceptable performance of the proposed method. The influence of EVs'
   participation on operation costs, load curve, and EV bills is discussed.},

Abstract = {Recognized as an efficient approach to reduce fossil fuel consumption
   and alleviate environment crisis, the adoption of electric vehicles
   (EVs) in urban transportation system is receiving more and more
   attention. EVs will tightly couple the operations of urban
   transportation network (UTN) and power distribution network (PDN),
   necessitating the interdependent traffic-power modeling to optimize the
   on-road EV charging decisions. In this article, the optimal charging
   pricing problem of public electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs)
   considering the interdependent operations of UTN and PDN is modeled from
   the view of the charging network operator (CNO), which is formulated as
   a bi-level optimization problem. In order to match the spatial size of
   UTN and power capacity of PDN, multiple PDNs are incorporated in the
   modeling to support EVCSs at different parts of UTN, permitting charging
   load migration across PDNs. Fixed point theory is used to analyze
   properties of the CNO's optimal charging pricing problem. An iterative
   method is designed to obtain the optimal charging pricing result, which
   solves the CNO's pricing subproblem and PDN market clearing subproblem
   in turn. Numerical case study results validate the effectiveness of
   proposed models and methods, and demonstrate the impacts of the CNO
   pricing on the operations of UTN and PDN.},

Abstract = {Widespread utilization of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) would incur
   more uncertainties, and thus challenge the traditional planning
   strategies for distribution systems. In this paper, a scenario-based
   comprehensive expansion planning (SCEP) approach for distribution
   systems is presented to cope with future uncertainties. This approach
   can not only take into account the initial investment and operation
   costs but also consider the expected adaptation cost to other future
   scenarios, and in this way the flexibility of an initial planning scheme
   can be achieved. Future scenarios are identified in line with three
   uncertainties, namely the conventional load levels, penetration levels
   of PEVs and whether or not with successful implementation of a
   coordinated charging strategy. The charging profile for dump charging
   mode has been determined straightforwardly, while that for coordinated
   charging mode is obtained by solving the proposed day-ahead dispatching
   model (DDM). Furthermore, a priority-based real time dispatching
   strategy (PRTDS) is proposed to obtain direct charging instructions for
   PEVs, and thus to demonstrate the rationality of utilizing the charging
   profile acquired from DDM in distribution system expansion planning
   (DSEP). Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is
   demonstrated by numerical studies.},

Abstract = {The interdependency of transportation and electric power networks is

   big M method, and a linear expression of power loss to transform the
   nonlinear planning problem into a mixed-integer quadratically
   constrained programming (MIQCP) formulation, which is solved by
   commercial solvers. The proposed MIQCP formulation is decomposed into
   two corresponding subproblems by Lagrangian relaxation to represent

Abstract = {The development of electric vehicles (EVs) as part of the
   electrification of the transportation sector plays a significant role in
   energy transition to a low-carbon and highly renewable society. The use
   of EVs has been promoted through the development of inclusive strategies
   for electromobility in the recent years. Apart from actions directed and
   funded by the European Union, national strategies have also been
   employed to support electromobility. Such a strategic plan has already
   been enacted by the Hellenic Ministry of Environment and Energy, funding
   municipalities to prepare siting and sizing plans for electric vehicle
   chargers. In this paper, the final study of this strategic plan for the
   municipality of Heraklion in Crete is used as a case study to
   investigate the effect of EV chargers on the operation of the Cretan
   power system. Their selected siting points are evaluated by performing a
   power flow analysis at the level of 150 kV. Thus, they are aggregated in
   each 20 kV/150 kV distribution substation of the electrical grid with
   the aim of investigating their effect on substation loading and
   transmission line losses. Generally, extensive fast charging should be
   avoided to minimize the risk of sudden stress of the existing cities'
   grids and control strategies should be implemented to mitigate the need
   for upscale substation equipment or even postpone reinforcements.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the increasing development of grid-connected microgrids
   predominantly powered by renewable energy sources, their negative impact
   on the distribution grid cannot be ignored. Whilst this burden is borne
   by the distribution system operator (DSO), microgrid-users can
   contribute in grid congestion management to maintain a stable grid
   connection by providing flexibility on the DSO's request. This paper
   uses Jacobi-alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize
   power exchange between a microgrid and the grid to assist in congestion
   management. The algorithm decomposes the optimization problem into
   sub-problems solved locally and in parallel using fitted Q-iteration.
   The local optimization plans the operation of heat pumps and batteries
   to provide the required flexibility. The performance of the proposed
   framework is evaluated using real-world data from thirty residential
   prosumers. Simulation results show that solving the sub-problems with
   fitted Q-iteration leads to feasible control policies within acceptable

Abstract = {Aiming at the randomness of current electric vehicle (EV) users'
   participation in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling, this paper
   establishes an electric vehicle indicators evaluation model and proposes
   an optimal scheduling strategy to achieve optimal EV cluster scheduling.
   By analyzing the influence of various information declared by electric
   vehicle users on the dispatching plan made by aggregators, and by taking
   the declared dispatching power, users' credit, battery loss and users'
   participation as evaluation indicators, the evaluation index model of
   electric vehicle cluster is established. The weight of each index is
   determined based on the optimal combination weight method of accelerated
   genetic algorithm. At the same time, this paper compares and analyzes
   various scenarios under different weights to obtain the scheduling order
   of each electric vehicle in the cluster. Combined with the requirements
   of power system scheduling plan, this paper further determines the
   schedulable ability of each aggregator in each period. The example
   simulation shows that the comprehensive weights adopted in this paper
   not only can exclude the fleets with poor credit, but can also eliminate
   the fleets with low declared power. The proposed strategy can reasonably
   and effectively dispatch electric vehicle cluster to participate in the
   scheduling plan by comprehensively considering the influence of multiple

Abstract = {As the final stage of power system restoration, the critical task of
   load restoration is to restore the remaining load as quickly as

   gradually increases. Therefore, based on the existing grid environment,
   this paper considers the sudden increase in load recovery caused by cold
   load pick-up and the auxiliary effect of electric vehicle discharge on
   load recovery during the load recovery process. From the perspective of
   economy, safety, and speed, this paper establishes a multi-objective

   entropy, and the number of recovered lines. The multi-objective
   evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition is used to optimize the

Abstract = {Demand response (DR) programs create incentives to effectively exploit

   proposes a novel multi-stage robust energy and reserve dispatch model
   with the DR program, where DDUs of deferrable loads and
   decision-independent uncertainties (DIUs) of curtailable loads are
   considered simultaneously. Then we develop an improved constraint

Abstract = {Different architectures for hybrid powertrains exist. Traditionally, to
   compare their efficiency, one energetic model is developed per
   architecture and is optimized. Today, this heuristic approach can be
   replaced by a systematic method that explores all the possibilities in a
   defined search space. This article presents hybrid electric vehicle
   (HEV) optimization and comparison using an automatic methodology for
   architecture generation. The components of the series-parallel hybrid
   architecture, with the exception of planetary gears, are chosen as
   starting components. All possible architectures are generated and then
   filtered to determine the most promising ones. The latter are
   automatically assessed and optimized using a general hybrid model. The
   process includes a genetic algorithm (GA) for design optimization and
   dynamic programming (DP) for control optimization. Given two different
   objectives to minimize, namely, battery size and fuel consumption in our
   considered case, the Pareto fronts of the most promising architectures
   are presented and compared to the Pareto fronts of reference
   series-parallel architectures. Several of the filtered architectures are
   found to be better than the references (their consumption is roughly 5
   \& percnt; lower), and a gain in powertrain sizing and cost is found.
   The best architecture is explored, and its operation is analyzed to
   determine the functionalities that lead to its energy efficiency.},

Journal = {ETRANSPORTATION},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Demand side management (DSM) is a great challenge for new power systems
   based on renewable energy. Vehicle -to -Building (V2B) and Energy
   Storage Systems (ESS) are two important and effective tools. However,
   existing studies lack the sizing method of bidirectional chargers and
   ESSs. This study has proposed a costeffective sizing method of V2B
   chargers and ESSs during the planning stage. By developing a linear
   model that clusters electric vehicle users based on mobility patterns
   and employing mixed integer linear programming for day -ahead control
   strategies, the method minimizes the dynamic payback period of initial

   the optimal configuration of 50\% V2B chargers and 1 ESS significantly
   reduces cumulative peak -hour load and peak power by 51.3\% and 42.4\%,

Abstract = {The sub-aggregation of electric vehicles provides significant potential
   to power systems in the form of ancillary services. This means with
   smart charging it is possible to shift loads from peak to off-peak
   hours. For the flexibility from privately owned electric vehicles to be
   offered to the electricity market, customer participation is crucial;
   however, the impacts of sub-aggregation on customers have not been
   studied thoroughly. In this paper, charging data covering over 80,000
   real-world charging sessions from various commercial charging sites are
   introduced and the charging characteristics are analyzed. Importantly, a
   method for finding an optimal pattern for load reduction with the least
   impact on customers is presented. We suggest an optimal schedule for
   load reduction from the customer viewpoint at different types of
   charging sites, including public car parks, offices, residential sites,
   and shopping centers. The findings indicate that residential and office
   charging sites offer the greatest potential for load reduction with the
   least impact on customers. The most flexibility is available during peak
   charging hours, which on average are at 08:00 at car parks, 07:30 at
   office sites, 19:00 at residential sites, and 10:00 at shopping centers.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article proposes a synergistic approach that traverses the battery
   optimal size simultaneously against the optimal power management based
   on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). A fuel cell hybrid electric
   vehicle (FC-HEV) with the FC/battery hybrid powertrain is used as the
   study case. The battery plays a key role in current transportation
   electrification, and the optimal sizing of the battery is critical for
   both system technical performances and economical revenues, especially
   in the hybrid design. The optimal battery design should coordinate the
   static sizing study against the dynamic power distribution for a given
   system, but few works provided the synergistic consideration of the two
   parts. In this study, the interaction happens in each sizing point with
   the optimal power sharing between the battery and the FC, aiming at
   minimizing the summation of hydrogen consumption, FC degradation, and
   battery degradation. Under the proposed framework, the power management
   is developed with deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, considering
   multiobjectives that minimize hydrogen consumption and suppress system
   degradation. In the case study, optimal sizing parameters with lowest
   cost are determined. Leveraged by the optimal size, the hybrid system
   economy with synergistic approach is improved by 16.0\%, compared with
   the conventional FC configuration.},

Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {230},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The integration of renewable energy (RE) and electric vehicles (EVs)
   into microgrids enhances energy sustainability, but their variability
   complicates capacity planning. Therefore, a capacity planning method is
   proposed from the perspective of reliability evaluation and economic
   analysis. Firstly, an EVs model with load characteristics is developed.
   Then, the reliability evaluation process and economic model are
   presented. Finally, the capacity planning schemes are compared and
   selected in the modified RBTS BUS6 F4 system. The results show that the
   probability indices will be optimized by increasing RE capacity with a
   certain energy storage system (ESS) configuration, but the system
   average interruption frequency index (SAIFI) shows non-monotonic change.
   Taking Microgrid A as an example, the peak of SAIFI can be reduced by
   63.17 \% when ESS configuration change from 1.0 MW \& sdot;h/0.1 MW to
   3.0 MW \& sdot;h/1.5 MW, which indicates that reasonable ESS
   configuration can effectively reduce the impact of SAIFI on microgrid.
   Comparing the reliability and economy of Microgrid B and Microgrid C,
   when the microgrid is connected at a lower load level, Microgrid C can
   reduce the total cost by 1,764,999 CNY while maintaining the same
   reliability as Microgrid B. The research results can provide reference
   for microgrid planning. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Large integration of electric vehicles (EVs) brings uncertainties and
   challenges for distribution networks. Reliability and allocation of
   charging systems (charging stations and piles) need strong support from
   the distribution network, whose expansion planning would be also greatly
   impacted by the incremental load from the charging system. To address
   this issue, a collaborative planning scheme of the EV charging system
   and distribution networks that combines economic and reliability
   benefits is proposed, which is formulated as a two-stage
   distributionally robust optimization model considering source-load
   uncertainties. First, a candidate EVCS planning scheme is obtained using
   queuing theory. Then, system reliability is quantified by adopting the
   average energy not supplied index and correlated integrated into the
   two-stage mixed-integer linear programming model. Finally, it is solved
   to perform distributionally robust expansion planning by the column and
   constraint generation algorithm. Effectiveness and scalability of the
   proposed planning method are illustrated by numerical case studies.
   Results indicate the planning scheme that considers economic and

Title = {A bi-level resilience-oriented islanding framework for an active

Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {218},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Due to the increase in natural disasters, islanding and reconfiguring
   plans are used to enhance the resiliency of distribution networks (DN).
   Due to the increase in Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) penetration, the
   power system's resilience can be increased by scheduling PEV charging
   and discharging in electrified Parking Lots (PLs); So this paper
   presents a bi-level optimization model that considers the electrical and
   transportation networks simultaneously. The Upper-Level (UL) problem
   specifies the optimal DN islanding plan to maximize the amount of load
   restored utilizing the optimal charge/discharge management of PEVs in
   PLs. The closest energized PL to the deenergized destination PLs and the
   number of PEVs in energized PLs are specified in the Lower-Level (LL)
   problem. The proposed bi-level framework is converted into a
   single-level model utilizing the Karush-KuhnTucker optimality
   constraints due to the linearity of the LL problem. The efficiency of
   the proposed framework is verified using GAMS software applying the
   IEEE-33 bus distribution system, and the 25-node traffic network.
   Analysis of the simulation results shows that the optimal islanding
   decision considering the PEV drivers' willingness to stop in energized
   PLs and optimal charge and discharge management of these PEVs enhances
   the resilience of the DN.},

   following three issues: 1) optimal sizing and scheduling of nanogrids

   volatile renewable energy sources ( RES); 2) surplus RES generation can
   be aggregated and stored in the BSS for supplying electric vehicles at

Abstract = {To determine the optimal size of an energy storage system (ESS) in a

   enhancement of EVs' resilience, and reduction of peak load have been
   considered in this article. Especially, the resilience aspect of the EVs
   is focused due to its significance for EVs during power outages. First,
   the stochastic load of the fast-charging station (FCS) and the
   resilience load of the EVs are estimated using probability distribution
   functions. This information is utilized to maintain the energy level in
   the ESS to ensure the resilience of EVs during power outages. Then, the
   annualized cost of the ESS is determined using the annual interest rate
   and lifetime of ESS components. Finally, the optimal ESS size is
   determined using the annualized ESS cost, penalty cost for buying power
   during peak hours, and penalty cost for resilience violations.
   Simulations along with sensitivity analysis of uncertainties (market
   price, arrival time of EVs, and the residual energy level of EVs),
   number of EVs in the FCS, and converter ratings are conducted.
   Simulation results have shown that increasing the penalty cost for peak

Abstract = {The expectation of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) charging and

   power system. As a smart load, EV requires an intelligently designed
   scheduling and pricing algorithm that takes into account the stochastic
   EVs user behavior, grid charging capacity, battery characteristics, and
   real-time electricity price variations. In this paper, a multi-objective
   comprehensive stand-alone solution is proposed considering the
   time-of-use (TOU) price to intelligently regulate EVs
   charging/discharging activities. The proposed alternative heuristic
   charging strategy optimally configures solution indices and provide a
   tradeoff between considered evaluation parameters, thus mitigating the
   effect of uncontrolled charging introduced by stochastic EV
   charge/discharge activities. The objective is to shift the peak hours
   load to nonpeak hours with reduction in average-to-peak ratio, charging
   cost minimization and maximize the availability of charging capacity for
   pledging the traveling plan determined by EV users. Different EVs

Abstract = {The emerging popularity of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) is creating

   process and infrastructure, etc. This paper provides a guide for
   simulating the accumulative load profile for EV charging on a national
   level. The importance of all the parameters and variables involved
   (deterministic or stochastic) is investigated. Detailed tables and

   the EV fleet are provided. A multivariate probabilistic model is
   developed considering the EV classes, weekly and seasonal driving
   patterns, charging strategies, battery capacities, consumption per EV,
   etc., leading to an accurate estimation of aggregated EV charging

Abstract = {An increased penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the
   transportation sector will raise electricity demand inevitably, while
   dramatically changing its temporal and spatial patterns. This will
   result in more reliability stress and security constraints on existing
   and planned electricity generation and transmission assets, at a time
   utilities are facing pressure to do more with less. This paper proposes
   to address grid limitations, which may constrain large-scale PEV
   integration in future grids, using a novel planning model for
   transmission and generation expansions under uncertainties, based on
   adaptive robust optimization via scenario-based ambiguity sets. The new
   model can achieve decarbonization of both the electricity and
   transportation sectors economically, while meeting the electric grid
   reliability requirements. It also incorporates PEV charging controls
   over the planning horizon aiming at facilitating the maximum PEV
   penetration in the used test cases, more economically and realistically,
   considering current technology trends. Successful applications of the
   proposed model on a 118 bus test system and the simplified Ontario's
   transmission grid demonstrate, in a satisfactory manner, its capability
   and effectiveness for planning deep decarbonization technology paths.},

Title = {Risk Averse Scheduling by a PEV Aggregator Under Uncertainty},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {882-891},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research on electric power systems has considered the impact of
   foreseeable plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) penetration on its
   regulation, planning, and operation. Indeed, detailed treatment of PEV
   charging is necessary for efficient allocation of resources. It is
   envisaged that a coordinator of charging schedules, i.e., a PEV
   aggregator, could exercise some form of load control according to
   electricity market prices and network charges. In this context, it is
   important to consider the effects of uncertainty of key input parameters
   to optimization algorithms for PEV charging schedules. However, the
   modeling of the PEV aggregator's exposure to profit volatility has
   received less attention in detail. Hence, this paper develops a
   methodology to maximize PEV aggregator profits taking decisions in
   day-ahead and balancing markets while considering risk aversion. Under
   uncertain market prices and fleet mobility, the proposed two-stage
   linear stochastic program finds optimal PEV charging schedules at the
   vehicle level. A case study highlights the effects of including the
   conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) term in the objective function and
   calculates two metrics referred to as the expected value of aggregation
   and flexibility.},

Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {189},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {One of the most important aspects of the development of Electric
   Vehicles (EVs) is the optimal sizing and allocation of charging
   stations. Due to the interactions between the electricity and
   transportation systems, the key features of these systems (such as
   traffic network characteristics, charging demands and power system
   constraints) should be taken into account for the optimal planning. This
   paper addressed the optimal sizing and allocation of the fast-charging
   stations in a distribution network. The traffic flow of EVs is modeled
   using the User Equilibrium-based Traffic Assignment Model (UETAM).
   Moreover, a stochastic framework is developed based on the Queuing
   Theory (QT) to model the load levels (EVs' charging demand). The
   objective function of the problem is to minimize the annual investment
   cost, as well as the energy losses that are optimized through
   chance-constrained programming. The probabilistic aspects of the
   proposed problem are modeled by using the point estimation method and
   Gram-Charlier expansion. Furthermore, the probabilistic dominance
   criteria are employed in order to compare the uncertain alternatives.
   Finally, the simulation results are provided for both the distribution
   and traffic systems to illustrate the performance of the proposed

Abstract = {In recent decades, fossil fuels have been the major source of energy but
   concerns about price fluctuations, security, and environmental issues.
   Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) should be connected to the power grid
   for battery charging. With a wide range of cars, the power system
   performance in the distribution network. The uncontrolled charging of
   the battery can cause issues such as overvoltage, overload, unbalanced
   load, instability, harmonics, and increased loss. Hence, efficient
   charging methodologies need to be developed for the power grid. The
   objective of this article is to maximize the total revenue of the
   charging stations and schedule the charging stations for PEV charging
   with reduced cost. First, the system model with its objectives such as
   demand, constraints, and fitness values are computed. Next, efficient
   charging path planning is proposed using the deep Q network, which is a
   reinforcement learning model. This can assist the PEV user in selecting
   the charging station and planning its path. Lastly, the particle
   sailfish optimization from our previous research work has been used to
   solve the charging station optimal solution. The simulation results

Abstract = {Hydrogen has been advocated as a promising energy carrier for railway
   systems, but its limited energy density may introduce mileage anxiety
   into the transportation system. Motivated by nonstop power exchange
   design, this article proposes a novel facility planning model under
   energy transfer conditions and natural endowments, such as photovoltaic
   resources in geographical locations, to optimize the overall system
   benefit. The supply, consumption, and replenishment mechanisms of
   multienergy forms (hydrogen energy, photovoltaic, electric energy) are
   designed on both vehicle and ground sides of the power exchange system.
   The optimal facility location and allocation of photovoltaic hydrogen
   plants, movable tank shifting devices, and train cars are
   collaboratively decided. A Lhasa-Xining railway case study is applied by
   conducting sensitivity analyses on significant parameters. Various
   insights hold the promise to promote policies and strategies for
   integrating transportation and power systems in a real-world
   application. It is demonstrated that energy cost reduction, solar power

Abstract = {Uncoordinated charging of large-scale electric vehicles can affect the
   safe and economic operation of distribution power system. As an
   intermediary between power grid and individual electric vehicle,
   electric vehicle aggregator can play an important role in the
   coordination and management of electric vehicle charging. In this paper,
   we develop a decentralized EV charging control strategy of the electric
   vehicle aggregator for scheduling the flexible charging demand of
   plug-in electric vehicles in residential distribution networks. First,
   the centralized charging control model of the electric vehicle
   aggregator aiming at the maximization of its revenue under the
   background of time of use price mechanism is established, meanwhile
   meeting individual charging requirements and satisfying distribution
   network constraints. Then a decentralized charging control strategy of
   the electric vehicle aggregator based on the augmented Lagrangian method
   and the alternating direction multiplier method is proposed. The
   electric vehicles can decide their charging plan locally with the
   decentralized strategy, which can eliminate the problem of high
   communication cost, low computing efficiency and privacy protection
   caused by the centralized charging control model in practical
   application. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated

Abstract = {The usage of electric vehicles is daily increasing. It is predicted that
   the penetration of electric vehicles in the electrical network will grow
   steadily during the next few years. This growth of penetration causes
   major challenges for power system users, especially the distribution

   hours, and secondly, increasing the cost of developing a network to
   provide load, along with the operation moved away from the optimum
   point, are the major challenges of the penetration of electric vehicles.
   In this research, a solution is proposed not only to resolve these
   challenges but also to make an opportunity to improve the network
   parameters. In this study, the charging and discharging strategy along
   with two price-based and voltage-based load management programs are
   proposed to manage the penetration of electric vehicles for economic and

Abstract = {The increasing sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in the market poses
   critical questions for the public on how to deal with millions of
   retired batteries (RBs). A number of studies have shown that second-life
   batteries (SLBs) from EVs usually have a considerable remaining capacity
   and hence still have additional utilization value. This article proposes
   a novel fuzzy inference system (FIS)-based planning framework for EV
   charging stations with wind, PV power, battery energy storage system and
   the utilization of SLBs (EVCS-WPE-SLBs system). In this framework, a
   narrowed and the most probable candidate node set for EVCS-WPE-SLBs
   system which makes the trade-off of several off-site factors from
   different fields that jointly determine the optimal planning results is
   obtained, including the installation and utilization requirements of
   SLBs, the transportation network features and power system properties.
   Numerical case studies are conducted on a coupled IEEE 33-bus
   distribution system and 25-node transportation system. According to the
   simulation results, the reasonable utilization of SLBs in the
   EVCS-WPE-SLBs system can reduce the total system cost while maintaining
   the normal operation of the system. Besides, a narrowed and most
   probable candidate node set not only reduces the search space and
   simplifies the optimization problem, but the results obtained are more
   practical according to the actual system conditions in real life.},

Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},

Volume = {199},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {In residential areas, the hours when commuters charge their electric
   vehicles (EVs) after work often coincide highly with the peak
   residential electricity consumption hours, which will create security
   risks to the power system and affect the normal operation of the power
   grid. In contrast to the inevitability and immutability of the use of
   household appliances, the duration and time period of charging electric
   vehicles can be changed. This paper addresses the aforementioned problem
   by time-of-use (TOU) electricity price, which can guide residents to
   stagger hours to charge, achieving the objective of peak load shifting.
   Taking residential areas as the research scope, considering the
   uncertainty of EV users' homecoming time, departure time and charging
   demand, the article proposes a bi-level planning model for pricing
   electric vehicle charging. The lower level is a minimization model of
   charging costs for individual users, which can acquire the charging load
   of all vehicles for multiple days. The upper level is a robust
   optimization model of TOU electricity price considering uncertain
   factors, which obtains the fast and slow charging prices. It has been
   demonstrated that the model increases grid stability by 43.46\%.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP)
   method through chance constrained mixed-integer programming (MIP)
   designed to alleviate the possible congestion in the future distribution
   network with high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs). In order to
   represent the stochastic characteristics of the EV driving patterns, a
   chance constrained optimization of the EV charging is proposed and
   formulated through MIP. With the chance constraints in the optimization
   formulations, it guarantees that the failure probability of the EV
   charging plan fulfilling the driving requirement is below the
   predetermined confidence parameter. The efficacy of the proposed
   approach was demonstrated by case studies using a 33-bus distribution
   system of the Bornholm power system and the Danish driving data. The
   case study results show that the DLMP method through chance constrained
   MIP can successfully alleviate the congestion in the distribution
   network due to the EV charging while keeping the failure probability of

Abstract = {A considerable number of classic and modern control applications in
   distribution systems are developed aiming at make the most of the
   existing infrastructure. Under this perspective, investments
   postponement in grid upgrade appears as a good expectable result. The
   advent of smart grids enhances this expectation since it promises
   ubiquitous system monitoring, secure and trustworthy communication
   technologies and advanced control schemes. These features will allow the
   implementation of innovative algorithms for better operation and
   management of system assets. New possibilities arise for DSM,
   microgeneration control, electric vehicle charging and intelligent
   operation of energy storage devices. The scientific literature has
   countless examples that illustrate the benefits of such tools. A
   frequent outcome of these studies highlights the advantage of
   investments deferral in network reinforcement.
   This paper analyzes the combined effects of these control actions with
   the investments required for network upgrade, namely in lines and
   transformers reinforcement. Contrary to other research papers, our
   results demonstrate that investments deferral could lead frequently to
   higher costs in a long-term perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   scheduling process there is crucial need for a reliable optimal
   algorithm. The proposed approach can be applied in energy management
   platforms of decarbonized eco-friendly power systems. Generation
   scheduling is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem: (a)
   minimize generation production cost and (b) minimize emission costs. The
   focal concern is to (a) handle the scheduling of renewable energy
   resources against their volatilities, (b) integrating PHEVs with
   uncertainties related to their state of charge, and (c) stochastic load
   behavior over a whole week. Two heuristic-based algorithms are used to
   solve the optimization problem, namely Water Cycle Algorithm and
   Gravitational Search Algorithm The proposed scheduling approach is
   implemented in MATLAB ? Platform, and is tested using two different
   microgrids sizes, 3 generator, and 10 generator unit systems integrating
   the effect of week days profile, renewable energy intermittency and
   different PHEV state of charges using the IEEE Reliability Test System
   (RTS) data. The results show promising performance of GSA over the WCA
   in the energy management studies integrating three different types of
   sources; thermal units, Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), and the

Abstract = {Due to the rising of both economic and environmental concerns in the
   energy sector, each subdivision of the community is investigating new
   solutions to overcome this critical issue. For this reason, electric
   vehicles (EVs) have gained more significance in the transportation
   sector owing to their efficient and clean operation chance. These
   improvements, however, bring new challenges such as installation costs,
   infrastructure renovation, and loading of the existing power system.
   Here, optimal sizing and siting of EV charging stations (CSs) are
   examined in a mixed-integer linear programming framework with the aim of
   minimizing the number of EVCSs in the distribution system (which in turn
   means to minimize CS-related investment while satisfying EV owners'
   needs) while satisfying constraints. The proposed optimization model
   considers EVCS types with different charging rate capabilities to
   provide opportunities for demand-side management. Moreover, the model
   takes the actual behaviour of the battery charging pattern into account
   by using real measured EV charging data together with the consideration
   of an actual distribution system belonging to a region in Turkey.
   Lastly, a bunch of case studies is conducted in order to validate the
   accuracy and effectiveness of the devised model.},

Abstract = {As the number of electric vehicles and PhotoVoltaic (PV) panels per
   household increases, the need for a coordination between these active
   components becomes more imminent. Home energy management systems (HEMS)
   have been proposed to increase efficiency, renewable energy capture and
   reduce costs for the owners. However, renewable energy is intermittent
   and time dependent. To increase the capture of this source, an
   integrated control with Electric Vehicle (EVs) is required to store
   excessive solar energy. Furthermore, coordination with the load profile
   enables storage for use at a later time or selling the excess energy to
   the grid. This requires the use of a Home Energy Management System
   (HEMS) that can coordinate all these components with the grid. Operation
   of these controllers need to be validated before actual deployment. In
   this paper, a standardized communication modeling based on IEC 61850 is
   developed for a HEMS controller. An integrated emulation platform using
   network simulator and IEC 61850 Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)
   emulator is set up and the operation of HEMS is demonstrated with proper
   message exchanges. Such validation is crucial to project's success

Abstract = {The rapid expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) brings forth a range of
   possibilities and obstacles for the electrical grid. EVs are a hopeful
   way to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil
   fuels, but the way they charge can put a lot of stress on the grid,
   which can cause problems for both grid operators and EV users. The
   uncontrolled approach to EV charging could result in the development of
   new peak loads. This paper formulates a problem for the minimisation of
   EV charging cost while reducing the load variance using a dynamic
   charging strategy. This dynamic charging strategy forecasts the charging
   price of EV for each time stamp based on the available energy
   generation. The proposed formulation has also considered the seasonal
   variation in load profile. The model is solved using different
   optimisation algorithm and different scenarios have been formulated to
   validate the effectiveness of the optimisation problem which has been
   formulated to achieve the objectives of minimised charging cost and load
   variance. The proposed strategy has improved the charging cost by 67\%
   from other strategies of EV charging while reduction in load variance
   comes out to be 69\%. This proposed formulation will help in the higher
   adoption of EV's and will subsequently lead to sustainable growth.},

Abstract = {Integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) with distributed

   Decision-Making under Spatiotemporal Reconfiguration},
Journal = {IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 4},
Abstract = {With the growing environmental awareness, electric vehicles (EVs), as
   flexible and mobile load resources, have gradually enhanced their
   optimization and regulation capabilities in power systems. However, the
   subjectivity and unpredictability of users' trip plans in special
   circumstances significantly impact the dispatching results of EV
   clusters. To address this issue, this paper establishes a real-time trip
   chain correction model that integrates power and traffic networks to
   simulate the distribution of EV charging loads under spatiotemporal
   reconfiguration. Furthermore, considering the dispatchable potential of
   EVs after trip completion, a user behavior decision-making method is
   proposed. This method utilizes fuzzy control to analyze EV charging
   demand and quantifies the degree of user responsiveness to the
   dispatching strategy. Then, based on the charging urgency index, a
   coordinated dispatching strategy is introduced to mitigate grid
   fluctuations, reduce peak loads, and lower user charging costs. Finally,
   experiments analyze the effects of spatiotemporal reconstruction and
   decision-making behavior on the EV dispatching process. Results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in reducing
   users' charging costs while achieving peak load reduction and valley
   filling in the power grid. (c) 2025 Institute of Electrical Engineers of

Abstract = {Proper selection of electric vehicle (EV) path will be helpful to
   improving the travel efficiency of EV users and alleviate their
   difficulties in charging during peak hours. In this context, a
   personalized fast-charging navigation strategy based on mutual effect of
   dynamic queuing is proposed. First, an effective charging navigation
   system is presented to enable the integration of EV information
   terminals, fast-charging stations (FCSs), intelligent transportation
   system, and information processing center (IPC). Next, by incorporating
   the real-time mutual effect of dynamic queuing as well as considering
   the priority reservation cost of the EV drivers who reserve charging
   priority before others, a dynamic reservation-waiting queue model is
   established. After that, on the basis of the above model, the coupling
   relations of the criteria that may affect the charging experience are
   investigated for the first time and the charging navigation plans in IPC
   are optimized for diverse EVs. Finally, the validity of the method is
   verified by conducting the simulation under the participation of 2250
   EVs in the urban areas of a city. Results show that the proposed
   charging strategy will increase charging satisfaction on average by more
   than 10.9\% in all analyzed cases. Additionally, the navigation can save

Abstract = {The major problems in the power system network of the South Asian
   Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region include the
   utilization of substantial fossil fuels, which leads to significant
   emissions of CO2. Moreover, due to the depletion of fossil fuels, it is
   very difficult to manage the demand requirement of the SAARC regions,
   which leads to significant power shortage issues. These problems would
   be resolved through the integration of the substantial amount of
   renewable energy resources (RERs) that are available in excess in the
   SAARC regions into the power system networks. This will provide a
   futuristic roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment in the
   SAARC region. In this regard, the SAARC region has devised a new plan to
   transform its smart grid infrastructure into the super smart grid (SSG),
   which would connect the SAARC countries using the high voltage
   transmission lines utilizing each country's substantial RERs. To
   accelerate this ecofriendly effort, the key objective of this review
   study is to evaluate the potential of the SAARC SSG for demand
   management and emissions reduction. This study provides a comprehensive
   overview of SSG technology, covering its technical background,
   management, power flow improvement techniques, power stability
   techniques, simulation models, and future steps for development in the
   SAARC region. First, the regional conflicts, energy deficiency, and
   potential of the SAARC region have been discussed. Second, a potential
   architecture of the SAARC SSG has been simulated. Third, a novel Markov
   chain modeling has been presented for demand management in the SAARC
   regions. The results and discussions section presents findings from
   simulations and models. The paper also discusses CO2 reduction
   techniques, including methods for capturing, storing, and utilizing
   carbon in biofuel. The study also discusses futuristic optimization
   techniques in SSG, including blockchain, federated learning,
   reinforcement learning, the metaverse, digital twin technology,
   artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The SSG challenges and
   limitations section summarizes the challenges and limitations faced by
   SSG. Finally, a roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment
   for the SAARC power grids has been identified to support the
   implementation of the futuristic SAARC SSG. The results exhibited that
   there is a good potential for successful demand management and emissions
   reduction through the SAARC SSG.},

Abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) are seen to have some negative impacts on

   reducing charging costs of EVs. In order to increase the network load
   factor some coefficients are introduced. Such coefficients, which depend
   on wind speed, solar irradiance and hourly peak demand ratio in the load
   characteristic of day-ahead, help aggregators to charge their EVs in
   off-peak hours. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is used for
   solving the optimization problem. The performance of the proposed method
   is evaluated for 69-bus and 94-bus microgrids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network for Charging
   Station Load Prediction},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {29000-29017},
Abstract = {The precision of electric vehicle (EV) charging station load forecasting
   is paramount for the efficient management of smart grids, fulfilling the
   charging demands of EV users and enhancing power system operations and
   planning. While existing forecasting methods have made strides, they
   often fall short in addressing the challenges of low spatial resolution
   and spatial heterogeneity. Low spatial resolution, characterized by
   sparse data distribution and a dearth of information between
   geographically diverse charging stations, coupled with spatial
   heterogeneity, which is evident in the fluctuating energy demand across
   different regions, requires a sophisticated approach. In this study, we
   introduce the Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network
   (MSSTGAN), a pioneering framework that adeptly navigates these
   complexities. MSSTGAN employs an encoder-decoder architecture
   underpinned by split-pyramid attention to resolve issues of low spatial
   resolution, enabling the model to process multi-scale data and capture
   temporal dynamics effectively. Moreover, it incorporates graph attention
   mechanisms to manage spatial heterogeneity in energy demand, ensuring a
   nuanced understanding of regional variations. Our framework's efficacy
   is underscored by its superior performance over existing baselines on
   four real-world EV charging station datasets, showcasing its prowess in
   tackling the intricacies of low spatial resolution and spatial
   heterogeneity.},

Abstract = {Isolated grids, with large-scale intermittent renewable energy sources
   (RESs), face more severe frequency stability issues. Fortunately,
   grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) present an opportunity to provide
   frequency services. In this paper, a two-stage frequency regulation
   strategy, in which EVs participate in the form of a virtual synchronous
   machine (VSM), is proposed. First, a frequency response (FR) model is
   established for both charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping
   stations (BSSs) using VSM control. On this basis, a two-stage strategy
   is proposed to consider both frequency regulation performance and system
   economy. Specifically, in the day-ahead stage (DAS), a multi-unit
   economic dispatch (ED) model is designed to formulate the operation
   plan; in the real-time stage (RTS), a consensus-based power allocation
   strategy is designed for multi-units, responsive to real-time market
   prices. Case studies involving real-world data of load, RES, and CS
   illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i)
   decreasing frequency deviation, (ii) providing extra rotational inertia,
   and (iii) reducing dispatch costs.},

Title = {Analysis of Optimal Integration of EVs and DGs Into CIGRE's MV Benchmark
   Model},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {95949-95969},
Abstract = {In today's transportation sector, the growing number of electric
   vehicles (EVs) is progressively replacing petroleum-fueled vehicles,
   which are also expected to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. The main
   problem with EVs is the requirement of charging energy, which is fed
   through distribution network, while simultaneously feeding already
   connected load. The EV's integration with the distribution network will
   overload the network due to EV's charging load, which will eventually
   trip the power system protection. In this context, it is necessary to
   minimize power losses, improve voltage profile with sustainable power
   supply network. Therefore, optimal placement of EVs is required in the
   distribution network. Conventionally, researchers have used DGs to
   minimize power losses and improve voltage profile. In this paper,
   authors analyzed the effect of EV's integration with simultaneous
   placement of distributed generations (DGs). The integration of EVs with
   higher penetration of DGs is cumbersome due to higher power losses and
   voltage variances that are outside allowable boundaries. The optimal
   placement of EVs into the distribution system with higher penetration of
   DGs is proposed in this paper using a battle royale optimization (BRO)
   algorithm. Since it is a new problem on CIGRE network which is not
   discussed before. Hence, the authors compared results with three most
   famous algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm
   optimization (PSO), and accelerated PSO (APSO). The optimization problem
   is developed as a multi-objective function while decreasing active and
   reactive power losses, and minimising maximum voltage deviation index.
   The studied distribution network is the CIGRE 14-bus medium voltage (MV)
   distribution network. Three case studies are taken in which EVs are
   integrated in two scenarios with optimally sized and located DGs systems
   in the CIGRE distribution network using MATLAB. Case-1 includes simple
   network with DGs integration. Case-2 includes EVs only in the simple
   network, and case-3 finally includes EVs and DGs for optimal placement
   with minimum losses. The placement of the EVs results in a decrease in
   power losses and voltage deviation indices. The bus voltages of case-2,
   on the other hand, stay unchanged when the EVs are integrated. Case 3
   with BRO showed the large reduction in power losses owing to the
   addition of EVs to the distribution network with DGs (from 19.98 kW, and
   19.89 kVar to 2.54 kW, and 3.35 kVar).},

Abstract = {In this study, the life cycle costs of railway projects involving hybrid
   diesel-electric vehicles are analysed. Specifically, the analysis
   focuses on the comparison of 3 lithium-ion battery technologies (NMC,
   LTO and LFP) and 8 energy management strategies (including rule-based
   and optimization-based strategies). In order to develop this analysis, a
   methodology that returns the life cycle cost of each proposed case is
   presented. The methodology includes the optimization of the diesel
   generator and lithium-ion battery sizing. A scenario based on a real
   railway line is introduced, and the obtained results are compared to a
   traditional diesel-electric railway vehicle to develop a
   techno-economical discussion. The best lithium-ion battery technologies
   are found to be LTO and NMC, and the most appropriated strategy a
   state-machine controller optimised by a genetic algorithm approach. The
   best case obtains a life cycle cost reduction of the 4.0\% and diesel
   savings of the 13.7\% compared to a traditional diesel-electric railway

   consideration of demand response of electric vehicles},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {228},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Grid-connected low-voltage direct current (LVDC) systems offer a
   promising solution for achieving low-carbon buildings. However, a new
   challenge arises in sizing grid-connected LVDC systems, which is to
   fully utilize distributed renewable energy, energy storage, and load
   demand response to minimize both the economy and carbon emissions. To
   address this gap, this paper studies the sizing of grid-connected LVDC
   systems, considering the grid-connected converter, photovoltaic (PV),
   battery, and demand response of electric vehicles (EVs). Firstly, two
   objective functions are proposed, including the economy and carbon
   emissions. Secondly, constraints for sizing and operation are presented,
   with particular consideration given to the discharging of EVs and the
   corresponding cost of cycle-life loss. Finally, a minimum fuzzy carbon
   emission method (MFCEM) is proposed to solve the model, which can
   adaptively and objectively transform the multi-objective into a single
   objective. According to the case study, the proposed model
   comprehensively considers the cost and carbon emissions of
   grid-connected LVDC systems, and its feasibility and validity are
   verified. Compared with the linear weighting method, MFCEM is a useful
   method for finding a point on the Pareto front that balances cost and
   carbon emissions.},

Abstract = {This paper will present the regenerative braking quantification, design

   electric vehicle (EV) in extreme conditions. The EV is driven by two
   30-kW permanent magnet synchronous motors. The HESS contains a Li-Ion

   dissipative resistor. The UC will be mainly involved in braking and

   of the elements takes into consideration the extreme braking conditions
   of the vehicle while respecting the Economic Commission for Europe

   regulate the various electrical variables of the overall system. A
   sequential logic controller is also being introduced. The role of the
   sequential logic controller is to activate the different existing

Abstract = {The use of stationary energy storage at the fast electric vehicle (EV)
   charging stations can buffer the energy between the electricity grid and
   EVs, thereby reducing the maximum required grid connection power and
   potentially mitigating the need for grid infrastructure upgrade. In this
   paper, a method is presented that sizes the stationary energy storage
   based on an acceptable average waiting time of drivers arriving at a
   fast-charging station. The novelty of this paper is the focus on the
   relationship between the size of stationary energy store and the user
   waiting time. This relationship is often ignored; however, it is
   critical to obtain the optimum capacity of stationary energy store. An
   example charging station location is chosen where there are currently
   eight chargers capable of 120-kW charging and a 500-kW grid connection.
   It is demonstrated that the method can be used at this location to
   design a charging station with stationary energy storage to support
   future 400-kW charging without upgrading the current grid connection
   infrastructure. With future charging, using a stationary energy storage
   with a capacity of 1000 kWh reduces the maximum grid power from 1800 to

Abstract = {Recently, renewable power generation and electric vehicles (EVs) have

   presents a grid-connected solar-wind hybrid system to supply the
   electrical load demand of a small shopping complex located in a

   incorporated in the system. Economic analysis is performed for the
   proposed setup to satisfy the charging demand of EVs as well as the
   electrical load demand of the shopping complex. The proposed system is
   designed by considering the cost of the purchased energy, which is sold
   to the utility grid, while the power exchange is ensured between the
   utility grid and other components of the system. The sizing of the
   component is performed to obtain the least levelized cost of electricity
   (LCOE) while minimizing the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) by
   using recent optimization techniques. The results demonstrate that the
   LCOE and LPSP for the proposed system are measured at 0.038 \$/kWh and
   0.19\% with a renewable fraction of 0.87, respectively. It is determined
   that a cost-effective and reliable system can be designed by the proper
   management of renewable power generation and load demands. The proposed
   system may be helpful in reducing the reliance on the over-burdened

Abstract = {Future planning of the energy supply and transportation should be taken
   into consideration simulta-neously. The cooperation of related
   stakeholders, especially institutions, distribution companies and new
   technology developers is of great importance in terms of foreseeing and
   preventing the problems to be encountered and of benefiting together. As
   it becomes more challenging to maintain the balance between energy
   supply and demand in electric power systems due to the stochasticity of
   both load demands and renewable power generation, Electric Vehicle (EV)
   batteries can play a critical role in supporting this balance for a

   on grid during the peak energy periods. The results obtained for two
   types of EVs with different characteristics show that the economic and

Abstract = {To mitigate the voltage violation and overloading caused by the
   integration of Distributed Generation (DG) and Electric Vehicle Charging
   (EVC) loads, a feasible solution is to convert some AC medium voltage
   distribution lines to DC ones and formulate an AC/DC hybrid distribution
   network, based on which flexible power shifting between lines can be
   achieved. However, the complementarity of power flows amongst AC/DC
   lines is hardly described and embedded in existing configuration
   optimization methods in which only the average loading or the variations
   of loading for a certain period is considered. Solution space will be
   geometrically increased if operation scenarios are fully simulated for
   configuration caused by the strong uncertainties of DGs and EVC loads.
   This paper proposes an analytic quantifiable method to describe the
   power complementarity between AC/DC lines. The Gaussian mixture model is
   used to depict the temporal correlation and uncertainties. The
   complementarity is calculated by the conditional probability of
   multi-dimensional joint probability density function of AC/DC hybrid
   lines. Accordingly, an optimal configuration method of hybrid AC/DC
   distribution network is proposed considering the complementarity of
   power flows on AC/DC lines, in which the size and location of Voltage
   Source Converters (VSCs) are optimized. Simulations studies are
   performed to verify the proposed method.},

Title = {Optimal Planning of Hybrid AC/DC Low-Voltage Distribution Networks

Abstract = {The increasing integration of distributed household photovoltaics (PVs)
   and electric vehicles (EVs) may further aggravate voltage violations and
   unbalance of low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs). DC distribution
   networks can increase the accommodation of PVs and EVs and mitigate
   mutilple power quality problems by the flexible power regulation
   capability of voltage source converters. This paper proposes schemes to
   establish hybrid AC/DC LVDNs considering the conversion of the existing
   three-phase four-wire low-voltage AC systems to DC operation. The
   characteristics and DC conversion constraints of typical LVDNs are
   analyzed. In addition, converter configurations for typical LVDNs are
   proposed based on the three-phase four-wire characteristics and
   quantitative analysis of various DC configurations. Moreover, an optimal
   planning method of hybrid AC/DC LVDNs is proposed, which is modeled as a
   bi-level programming model considering the annual investments and
   three-phase unbalance. Simulations are conducted to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed optimal planning method. Simulation
   results show that the proposed optimal planning method can increase the
   integration of PVs while simultaneously reducing issues related to
   voltage violation and unbalance.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Global electric vehicles (EVs) fleet is expanding at a rapid pace.
   Considering the uncertain driving pattern of EVs, they are dynamic
   consumers of electricity and their integration can give rise to
   operational problems and jeopardize the security of the power system.
   Under such circumstances, the implementation of demand-side response
   (DSR) programs is more likely to be an effective solution for reducing
   the risks of load curtailment or security problems. This study proposes
   a voltage stability constrained DSR-coordinated planning model for
   increasing the penetration level of EVs in a distribution system
   consisting of photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs) and responsive
   loads. The uncertainties of PV/WT generation, the driving pattern of
   EVs, and load demand are modeled by an improved form of information gap
   decision theory (IGDT), hereafter called weighted IGDT (WIGDT). Due to
   the fact that the proposed model is nonlinear and non-convex, a
   linearization technique is adopted and the proposed model is formulated
   as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), solved using the general
   algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software. The standard 33-bus
   distribution test system and a realworld smart distribution network,
   based in the Isle of Wight in the UK, are used to evaluate the
   performance of the model.},

Abstract = {Investigating optimal value of the power factor for the optimally
   allocated and sized solar parking lots of the plug-in electric vehicles
   (PEVs) based on minimum total cost of the problem over the given
   planning period is the aim of this study. Covering a parking lot with
   photovoltaic (PV) panels can keep the PEVs cool, charge their batteries
   for free, and generate extra energy and deliver it to the grid.
   Moreover, the inverter installed in the charging station of a parking
   lot is capable of generating or absorbing reactive power by changing the
   operating mode of the inverter without any degradation of the PEV's
   battery. Therefore, the PEVs and the solar parking lots can be applied
   as the auxiliary sources of active and reactive powers by the local
   distribution company (DISCO). In this study, in order to achieve
   realistic results, the economic aspects and technical factors of the
   system, and also the behavioural model of the PEVs fleet are taken into
   consideration in the planning problem. Moreover, the stochastic nature
   of the PEVs behaviour and power of the installed PV panels are modelled
   in the problem. Herein, the planning problem is solved applying quantum

Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {In an active network, as a virtual power plant (VPP), periodic
   maintenance of distributed generators (DGs) is critically vital for the
   reliable operation of the power system. To prevent unexpected failure of
   DGs and avoid deterioration of the grid's reliability, coordination of
   maintenance scheduling is indispensable. In this study, maintenance
   management of a VPP is proposed for scheduling the planned outage of
   DGs, in order to preserve their useful lifespan. In addition to
   conventional DGs and the upstream power grid, renewable generation
   including wind turbines and photovoltaic systems, energy storage
   systems, and curtailable loads are considered as components of the VPP.
   The proposed maintenance scheduling scheme provides different advantages
   in viewpoints of cost and reliability. Moreover, risk management is also
   investigated to lower the risk of maintenance scheduling due to the
   uncertainty in price in an energy market by adopting the conditional
   value at risk as a measure of risk. The overall cost is minimised
   considering the power loss in the grid as well as the security
   constraints such as DGs operational constraints, voltage magnitude, and
   transmission lines' power flow limit. The effectiveness of the proposed
   scheme is illustrated using numerical studies with short- and long-term

Title = {Intelligent RMPS Allocation for Microgrids Support During Scheduled

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {117946-117960},
Abstract = {New opportunities enabled by renewable mobile power stations (RMPSs), in
   association with microgrids (MGs) ability to operate islanded to the
   main grid, present a likely solution to ensure power system novel
   reliability requirements in face of the increasing number of severe
   disruptive events. In this perspective, this paper proposes a novel
   intelligent RMPS allocation method to support MGs during scheduled
   islanded operation. In this mode, the isolated operation of a MG is
   beforehand planned to mitigate the effects caused by possible
   predictable contingencies, e.g. weather-related events, as well as
   programmed maintenance. For this, first a novel energy management
   strategy (EMS) based on dynamic programming specifically designed for MG
   scheduled islanded operation is proposed. Next, a particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) method modified to ensure a continuous search space
   in the face of discrete load shedding policies is developed to determine
   the adequate allocation of RMPS. The proposed method is simulated
   considering different scenarios for a MG system considering local
   distributed generation capacity, electric vehicles penetration, load
   shedding based on priority groups, as well as technical and operational
   limits. The obtained results showcase the proposed approach ability to
   meaningfully improve MG service capacity during scheduled islanded

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study introduces an integrated model that examines the interactions
   between power systems, the potential impacts of cyberattacks, and the
   role of electric vehicles (EVs) in regulation-up markets. The model
   determines the optimal EV fleet size for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services

   ancillary services. It enables V2G aggregators to balance fleet
   availability with grid demands, ensuring efficient allocation of energy
   resources during crises. The study also explores monitoring the state of
   charge (SOC) to maintain sufficient battery levels for users' trips. The
   study quantifies the total cost using EVs for frequency regulation,
   accounting for electricity and battery degradation costs. In addition,
   optimizes power flow within the network, which is vital for power
   utilities to maintain system reliability under adverse conditions. A
   proactive network interdiction strategy is incorporated to mitigate
   cyberattacks on the power network. The combined impact of generator
   losses and infected nodes on critical infrastructure is also analyzed.
   The effectiveness of the model is benchmarked through four case studies.
   It successfully eliminated load shedding while tackling operational and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The proliferation of the electric vehicles field brings attention to
   fast-charging station planning. Recently, some studies found electric
   vehicles that receive fast-charging service may also bring much air
   pollution due to fossilfuel fired power generation. Hence, depending on
   the power generation mix, electric vehicles may have adverse
   environmental impacts. The current studies of fast-charging station
   planning only focus on power system planning and often ignore other
   parts of the transportation system such as internal combustion engine
   vehicles and gasoline stations. Moreover, most the current studies lack
   a comprehensive planning strategy for the fastcharging station that
   involves elements above simultaneously. In this context, an
   interdisciplinary study is implemented on the coordinated planning
   strategy of the fast-charging station in coupled transportation and
   power distribution systems. The proposed strategy with a multiple
   objective integer model can measure the impact of air pollutions from
   electric vehicles on air quality and human health in different areas.
   Considering the traffic flow assignment, the driving range logic
   constraints are used. The branch flow model is applied to power
   distribution systems. To measure the impacts of air pollutions on air
   quality and human health, the air pollution from the Road traffic model,
   the Gaussian Plum Model and the C-R function are adopted. Finally,
   numerical experiments are conducted to verify the proposed strategy and
   the mathematical model. The fast-charging station location and size can
   be determined by the mathematical model. The transition of gasoline
   station to fastcharging station is suggested according to the model as

Abstract = {This study models the coincidence factor (CF) of electric vehicle (EV)
   charging given driving and plug-in behaviors by combining data sources
   from travel surveys and recorded EV charging data. From these, we
   generate travel and plug-in behaviors by using a Monte Carlo approach to
   derive CFs. By varying the EV battery size, the rated charging power,
   and the plug-in behavior, their influence on the CF is examined. The key
   results show that the CF decreases to less than 25\% when considering
   more than 50 EVs with a charging level of 11 kW, with the CF strongly
   depending on the number of EVs considered. By contrast, the driving
   behavior and the battery size have a minor influence on the CF.
   Furthermore, when mixing the parameters, such as EV battery size and
   rated charging power, then, especially, the active power drawn by the
   feeder does not change linearly. Ultimately, the study aims to add to
   the state-of-the-art by solely and systematically focusing on the CF and
   its sensitivity to a number of key factors. For planning and design,
   distribution system operators may use this study as a part of their
   planning for the integration of electric vehicles in the electrical

Abstract = {In recent years, transportation electrification has emerged as a trend
   to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. The
   true success, however, of this trend depends on the successful
   integration of electric transportation modes into the infrastructure
   systems that support them. Left unmanaged, plug-in electric vehicles may
   suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads
   on the electrical grid. Online electric vehicles have emerged to
   remediate the need for stationary charging and its effects. While many
   works have sought to mitigate these effects with advanced control
   functionality, such as coordinated charging, vehicle-to-grid
   stabilization, and charging queue management, few works have assessed
   these impacts as a holistic transportation-electricity nexus. This paper
   develops a hybrid dynamic system model for transportation
   electrification. It also includes next generation traffic simulation
   concepts of multimodality and multiagency. Such a model can be used by
   electrified transportation fleet operators to not just assess but also
   improve their operations and control. The hybrid dynamic system model is
   composed of a marked Petri-net model superimposed on the continuous time
   kinematic and electrical state evolution. The model is demonstrated on
   an illustrative example of moderate size and functional heterogeneity.},

Abstract = {Electric power systems with a high penetration of photovoltaic
   generation and a relevant fleet of electric vehicles face significant
   stability challenges, particularly in mountainous areas where the
   variability of photovoltaic resources is pronounced. This study presents
   a novel methodology to strategically place electric vehicle aggregators
   along a feeder. This approach considers electrical variables and the
   dynamics of cloud movements within the study area. This innovative
   methodology reduces the substation's power load demand and significantly
   improves the end user's voltage levels. The improvements in voltage
   regulation and reduced demand on the substation provide clear benefits,
   including increased system resilience, better integration of renewable
   energy sources, and enhanced overall efficiency of the electric grid.
   These advantages are particularly critical in regions with high levels
   of photovoltaic generation and are important in promoting sustainable
   electric vehicle charging infrastructure. When analyzing different load
   scenarios for the IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder system, the
   consideration of distributed aggregators based on cloud movements
   decreased the power required at the substation by 21.25\%, and the
   voltage drop in loads was reduced from 6.9\% to 4.29\%. This research
   underscores the critical need to consider both the variability and

Abstract = {Restructuring of the electricity industry and the development of energy
   efficiency solutions are the two major developments of the recent power
   systems. Implementation strategies in the use of energy efficiency can
   be made by utilizing more energy-efficient equipment or increasing
   penetration rate of production of new sources of energy at the
   generating side. These new sources of energy can be renewable sources,
   especially wind resource and energy storage instruments such as
   grid-connected electric vehicles. The vehicles can be charged during the
   low load and discharged during peak load. In this study, wind resources
   and grid-connected electric vehicles are considered as an approach for
   energy efficiency strategies in generation expansion planning. But,
   because of high investment cost, great uncertainty of wind resources'
   productivity and uncertainty of their supportive policies no one will
   invest on them without proper supportive policies in a competitive
   environment. So support policies for wind resource are also considered.
   One of the fundamental problems of supportive policies is financial
   support in a competitive environment. Therefore, as an innovation of the
   paper, grid-connected electric vehicles is used to solve the problem. In
   the paper, the impact of these vehicles is considered in a way that they
   act integrated with wind resources and thus increases the capacity
   factor of wind resources. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Optimized allocation of microgrids' distributed generations and electric

Abstract = {The reliability-oriented optimized sizing and placement of electric
   vehicle (EV) charging stations (EVCSs) has received less attention. In
   addition, the literature review shows that a research gap exists
   regarding a clustering-based method to optimize the allocation of DGs
   and EVCSs, considering the system uncertainties. This article tries to
   fill such a knowledge gap by proposing a new clustering-based method to
   optimize the allocation of DGs and EVs simultaneously, considering the
   uncertainties of EV behaviours and stochastic behaviours of renewable
   DGs. Developing a new stochastic model for EVs using the clustering
   algorithm is one of the essential contributions. The uncertain
   parameters, e.g. EV charging loads based on EV owners' behaviours
   (arrival time, departure time, and driving distance) and renewable DGs,
   would be clustered. The proposed method could solve the execution time
   challenges of Monte Carlo simulation-based approaches to concern the
   stochastic behaviours of smart grids. The simultaneously
   reliability-oriented optimal allocation of EVCSs, DGs, and protection
   equipment, using the proposed clustering-based algorithm is another main
   contribution. The IEEE 33-bus test system is studied to examine the
   introduced method. Simulation results imply that a 1.45\% accuracy
   improvement could be obtained compared to available analytical ones,
   while its execution time is appropriate.
   The allocation of renewable/non-renewable distributed generations and
   electric vehicle charging stations are optimized. Considering system
   uncertainties by clustering algorithms is the main novelty of this
   research. image},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Number = {B},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the modern power system, the uncertainties such as renewable
   generation and electric vehicles are usually modelled as either interval
   or probabilistic variables for the power flow analysis. It is meaningful
   to study the mixed impacts of the interval and probabilistic variables
   on the power flow, but the existing methods considering the mixed
   impacts lack accuracy. This paper proposes a novel power flow analysis
   method considering both interval and probabilistic uncertainties, in
   which the probability box (P-box) model is established to investigate
   the power flow influenced by multi-type uncertainties. A
   probability-interval sample classification method combined with
   interpolation is proposed to achieve an accurate P-box representation of
   the power flow. Also, the correlation of uncertainties is fully
   considered where a novel extended optimizing-scenario method is proposed
   for obtaining the P-box model considering the multi-dimensional
   correlation of interval variables. Three test cases are carried out to
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The P-box represented
   results clearly reflect the fluctuation range and the corresponding
   probability of the power flow. The specific influences of the sample
   size, correlation, capacity of multi-type uncertainties on the power
   flow and the P-box model are also determined and summarized.},

Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2723-2733},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper presents a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation
   for combined generation, storage and demand response expansion planning.
   The proposed formulation captures flexibility dynamics in integrated
   energy systems in long horizons with large temporal resolution. The
   objective function considers costs related to: investment, operation,
   emission penalties, fixed and variable maintenance. The considered units
   are: generators, storage (batteries and hydro-pumped) and demand
   response units (desalination, power-to-X, electric vehicles and
   electrolysers). The operation is modelled as an hourly unit commitment
   including time-dependent startup costs and intertemporal constraints
   such as ramping limits and minimum up and down times. This flexibility
   enabling formulation boosts renewable integration and contributes
   towards decarbonisation of other energy sectors such as transport. A
   commercial solver is used to evaluate the formulation for large scale
   cases considering 20 years horizon and 12 full weeks per year imposing
   minimum renewable shares of 50 and 100\% in year 9 and 19, respectively.
   The formulation exceeds tractability limits of previous works, achieves
   lower over-installation and renewable curtailment by integrating
   flexibility in the generation expansion problem, and allows to size
   demand responsive units if desired.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the optimal distributed energy resources (DER)
   allocation and sizing into an LV distribution network (DN) considering
   demand response (DR) and high penetration of plug-in electric vehicles
   (PEV) in a two-stage stochastic programming framework. The model
   includes (i) economic variables related to the capital cost of the DERs
   capacity installed with their respective operational costs and (ii)
   operational technical constraints based on the AC power flow equations.
   The formulation estimates the distributed generation (DG) capacity in
   terms of apparent power, i.e., the capacity found by the model relates
   the active and reactive power injected from DG to the DN simultaneously.
   A linearization and a modified version of the genetic algorithm (GA)
   solve the mix-integer non-linear problem (MINLP), and the backward
   algorithm is applied to reduce the number of scenarios. The model is
   tested in the IEEE 69-bus system under 18 different scenarios of 24 h to
   measure the DERs capacity installed variability. Finally, the results
   showed that (i) the set of scenarios selected are decisive for the
   optimal capacity installed affecting the investment and the Grid
   dependence, (ii) the PEVs affect the total DERs capacity installed and
   the operation costs, and (iii) the reactive power provided by the DERs
   might supply the total reactive power demand. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {43},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and the growing adoption of
   renewable energy sources pose challenges to electricity grids, including
   unbalanced spatiotemporal power supply and demand, insufficient
   transmission and distribution capacities, and high power generation
   ramping needs. This study aims to better understand the potential of
   leveraging EVs' charging flexibility as energy storage to smooth daily
   power load profiles considering different solar and EV penetration
   levels. To achieve this goal, we propose a mathematical formulation of
   the charging flexibility set based on real daily trip-chain data and
   develop a convex optimization model to optimize the smoothness of the
   regional net load profile subject to the charging flexibility set. We
   implement the model using mobility, solar generation, and power load
   data in the service region of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for
   Planning (CMAP). Through sensitivity analyses, we quantify the potential
   impacts of EVs on the power systems at different levels of EV
   penetration, charging infrastructure availability, power load, and solar
   generation. The results demonstrate that EVs have the potential to
   smooth the overall power load if their charging/discharging scheduling
   can be properly coordinated. In particular, EVs can reduce the maximum
   ramping caused by uncoordinated charging by 65 \% through the use of
   managed charging/discharging capabilities. Additionally, providing
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities at the existing public charging
   stations can lead to a 29 \% ramp decrease compared with only allowing
   V2G at home.},

   investigates the impact of wind energy uncertainty on voltage stability

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Distributed energy resources (DERs) have gained particular attention in
   the last few years owing to their rapid deployment in power capacity
   installation and expansion into distribution systems. DERs mainly
   involve distributed generation and energy storage systems; however, some
   definitions also include electric vehicles, demand response strategies,
   and power electronic devices used for their coupling with power grids.
   DERs challenge the entire operating system owing to their heterogeneous
   energy generation from renewable energy sources, the probabilistic
   nature of electric vehicle charging, and end-user exponential
   integration of power electronic devices. Research on DER integration has
   been conducted in the academic and industrial sectors. This study
   proposes a schematic literature review of DERs, including its modelling,
   description of deterministic and probabilistic power flow methods, power
   grid topologies for studies, and impacts of DERs on power grid
   oper-ation. DERs are primarily modelled using probabilistic approaches.
   The most frequently optimized DER variables are sizing and location.
   Meanwhile, the most critical variables to analyse during their
   integration process to the power grid are voltage profile, frequency
   response, and charging of both lines and transformers, followed by less-
   proportional power quality indicators. Overall, DERs can improve the
   resilience of energy systems because they provide voltage and frequency
   support, reduce energy losses, enhance power quality indicators, and
   enhance energy recovery in extreme scenarios such as high-impact

Title = {Novel variable charging pricing strategy applied to the multi-objective
   planning of integrated fast and slow electric vehicle charging stations
   and distributed energy resources},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {241},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Electric vehicle charging stations are increasingly being deployed to
   accommodate the rising demand for electric vehicles. However, this
   additional load on the distribution system can lead to significant
   challenges, including increased power losses and undervolage issues.
   Therefore, this paper proposes the optimized planning of electric
   vehicle charging stations, along with the integration of distributed
   energy resources considering the power system operator's perspective.
   The approach focuses on minimizing the costs associated with public
   charging stations and distributed generators, as well as reducing power
   losses and voltage deviation of the system. Additionally, this study
   incorporates both fast and slow chargers to address user requirements,
   while promoting the use of slow charging to help reduce the peak load
   demand caused by the electric vehicle charging stations. A novel
   variable pricing strategy for slow charging is also proposed to decrease
   the operator's expenses while promoting this mode of charging. The
   proposed methodology is validated through the integration of a 33-bus
   distribution test system with a 25-node traffic system. The analysis was
   conducted using three multi- objective optimization methods:
   Multi-Objective Cuckoo Search, Multi-Objective Flower Pollination
   Algorithm, and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. From the
   results, it is possible to conclude that the proposed approach provides
   benefits not only to the system operator but also to EV users, given the
   reduction in their travel costs. Despite the increased charging demand,
   the optimization results show a reduction in voltage deviation by
   11.57\%-16.94\% and power losses by 19.71\%-24.20\% compared to the
   original system.},

Abstract = {As we transition toward a power grid that is increasingly based on
   renewable resources like solar and wind, the intelligent control of
   distributed energy resources (DERs) including photovoltaic (PV) arrays,
   controllable loads, energy storage, and plug-in electric vehicles (EVs)
   will be critical to realizing a power grid that can handle both the

   increasing system complexity. Realizing such a decentralized and dynamic
   infrastructure will require the ability to solve large scale problems in
   real-time with hundreds of thousands of DERs simultaneously online.
   Because of the scale of the optimization problem, we use an iterative
   distributed algorithm previously developed in our group to operate each
   DER independently and autonomously within this environment. The
   algorithm is deployed within a framework that allows the microgrid to
   dynamically adapt to changes in the operating environment. Specifically,
   we consider a commercial site equipped with on-site PV generation,
   partially curtailable load, EV charge stations and a battery electric
   storage unit. The site operates as a small microgrid that can
   participate in the wholesale market on the power grid. We report results
   for simulations using real-data that demonstrate the ability of the
   optimization framework to respond dynamically in real-time to external

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {11},
Pages = {72925-72941},
Abstract = {The fast adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has resulted in a growing
   concern for the planning and operation of the distribution power system.
   Thus, it is crucial to comprehensively assess the influence of EV
   charging load on the distribution system. To mitigate the operational
   risks and optimize control measures of the power network, a two-stage
   time series decomposition and BiLSTM deep learning architecture is
   proposed for accurately predicting EV charging load series. In the first
   stage, a Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) evaluation method is
   introduced for assessing the decomposition loss, and the Lion Swarm
   Optimization (LSO) is employed to determine the optimal combination of
   decomposition parameters, thereby reducing the empirical parameter
   randomness and minimizing the signal loss during the decomposition
   process. Then, Bidirectional Short and Long-term Memory Network model
   (BiLSTM) is established for forecasting each sub-sequence obtained
   through the decomposition process. In the second stage, a DeepBiLSTM
   model is built to realize the accurate prediction of residual series
   from the first stage. The performance of the proposed architecture was
   tested using real-world charging load data collected from EV stations
   located in Southern China. It demonstrates that our proposed forecasting
   method can outperform traditional algorithms in terms of MAPE and RMSE
   metrics for 1h-ahead, 2h-ahead, 4h-ahead, and 24h-ahead EV load

   Stations With Coordinated Spatiotemporal Charging Demand},

Abstract = {Proper planning of charging infrastructure can significantly facilitate
   the popularization of electric vehicles and alleviate users' mileage
   anxiety. Charging station siting and sizing are two key challenges in
   the planning with each of them being a complex optimization problem. In
   this paper, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to solve
   them together. First, considering that accurate charging demand
   estimation is crucial for planning, a traffic road network is
   established for this purpose. A Monte Carlo method is used to estimate
   the spatiotemporal distribution of charging demand in a region based on
   the probabilistic characteristics of user trips. Since uncoordinated
   charging not only increases the load but also leads to unstable
   operation of the local power system, a heuristic algorithm is proposed
   to coordinate charging scheduling. Then, based on the scheduled demand,
   this paper proposes a framework for the siting and sizing of charging
   stations to optimize the benefits for both operators and users by
   minimizing the construction, operation and maintenance costs, and the
   user's detour time. As the given problem is a complex multi-objective
   combinatorial optimization problem, it is easy to fall into local
   optimum if traditional evolutionary algorithms are employed. Therefore,
   a multi-objective dynamic binary particle swarm optimization method is
   designed to solve this problem effectively. Finally, experimental
   simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the other
   comparative algorithms in terms of solution quality. A case study is
   presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the
   proposed method in optimizing the location and capacity of charging
   stations.},

Title = {Optimal Location and Sizing of Electric Bus Battery Swapping Station in
   Microgrid Systems by Considering Revenue Maximization},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {41084-41095},
Abstract = {The radical increase in the popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) has in
   turn increased the number of associated problems. Long waiting times at
   charging stations are a major barrier to the widespread adoption of EVs.
   Therefore, battery swapping stations (BSSs) are an efficient solution
   that considers short waiting times and healthy recharging cycles for
   battery systems. Moreover, swapping stations have emerged as a great
   opportunity not only for EVs, but also for power systems, with
   regulation services that can be provided to the grid particularly for
   small networks, such as microgrid (MG) systems. In this study, the
   optimum location and size that maximize the revenue of a swap station in
   an MG system are investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this study
   is first to solve the placing and sizing problem in the MG from the
   perspective of a BSS. The results indicate that bus 23 is the BSS's
   optimal location and is crucial for maximizing revenue and addressing
   issues like the provision of ancillary services in microgrid system.
   Finally, the swap demand profile of the station serving electric bus
   public transportation system was obtained using an analytical model
   based on public transportation data collected in Berlin, Germany.},

Abstract = {With the share of electric vehicles (EVs) in the transportation sector
   rising, solutions for their power system and energy market integration
   are of increasing importance. In this context, aggregation entities are
   helpful for addressing the integration process of EV fleets. In this
   article, a novel methodology for day-ahead charging control of EV fleets
   is proposed. This includes the prediction of required energy used for
   charging purposes based on synthetic data and functionalities for
   optimized energy procurement in the day-ahead energy market to determine
   the aggregated charging schedule of the fleet. The aggregated charging
   schedule provides the basis for the proposed charging control algorithm
   for individual EVs. This algorithm allows for charging flexibility
   according to the user's driving preferences while considering data
   privacy. To avoid data privacy conflicts, the scheduling of the
   individual charging is decoupled from the upcoming individual driving
   schedules of the users themselves. This means that the user is not asked
   to plan and submit expected driving profiles. Instead, realization is by
   a user-oriented disaggregation that uses the aggregated charging
   schedule as an input to coordinate the individual charging processes
   itself. The resulting integrative market solution allows to fulfill the
   contract positions in energy market participation. The simulation
   results verify the optimality of the proposed methodology for day-ahead
   operation and its applicability for aggregation entities that serve as
   an intermediate between the vehicle owners and electrical utilities or
   the energy market.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel stochastic planning model for AC-DC hybrid
   distribution systems (DSs). Taking into account the possibility of each
   line/bus being AC or DC, the model finds the optimal AC-DC hybrid
   configuration of buses and lines in the DS. It incorporates
   consideration of the stochastic behavior of load demands and
   renewable-based distributed generators (DGs). The stochastic variations
   are addressed using a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. The objective of
   the planning model is the minimization of DS installation and operation
   costs. The optimal planning solution is obtained by dividing the hybrid
   planning problem into two nested optimization problems: 1) the main
   problem is formulated using a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the
   optimal AC-DC configuration and 2) the subproblem is used for
   determining the optimal power flow solution for each configuration
   generated by the GA. The proposed model has been employed for finding
   the optimal configuration for a suggested case study that included
   photovoltaic panels, wind-based DG, and electric vehicle charging
   stations. The same case study was also solved using a traditional AC
   planning technique in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   proposed model and the associated cost-savings. The results demonstrate
   the advantages offered by the proposed model. The proposed framework
   represents an effective technique that can be used by DS operators to
   identify the optimal AC-DC network configuration of future DSs.},

Abstract = {Considering the importance of the energy management strategy for hybrid
   electric vehicles, this paper is aiming at addressing the energy
   optimization control issue using reinforcement learning algorithms.
   Firstly, this paper establishes a hybrid electric vehicle power system
   model. Secondly, a hierarchical energy optimization control architecture
   based on networked information is designed, and a traffic signal timing
   model is used for vehicle target speed range planning in the upper
   system. More specifically, the optimal vehicle speed is optimized by a
   model predictive control algorithm. Thirdly, a mathematical model of
   vehicle speed variation in connected and unconnected states is
   established to analyze the effect of vehicle speed planning on fuel
   economy. Finally, three learning-based energy optimization control
   strategies, namely Q-learning, deep Q network (DQN), and deep
   deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, are designed under the
   hierarchical energy optimization control architecture. It is shown that
   the Q-learning algorithm is able to optimize energy control; however,
   the agent will meet the ``dimension disaster{''} once it faces a
   high-dimensional state space issue. Then, a DQN control strategy is
   introduced to address the problem. Due to the limitation of the discrete
   output of DQN, the DDPG algorithm is put forward to achieve continuous
   action control. In the simulation, the superiority of the DDPG algorithm
   over Q-learning and DQN algorithms in hybrid electric vehicles is
   illustrated in terms of its robustness and faster convergence for better
   energy management purposes.},

Abstract = {Secondary and primary substations of networks with electric vehicle (EV)
   chargers and photovoltaics (PVs) experience net loads characterized by
   uncertainty. Accurate characterization of EV, PV and net load energy
   profiles is necessary to plan new installations and to develop
   forecasting methodologies. This paper provides a novel contribution to
   the energy profile characterization of EVs and PVs, exploiting
   clustering techniques in a hierarchical framework to eventually
   characterize the overall net load profiles. In the proposal, the lower
   levels of the hierarchy identify clusters of EV load and PV generation
   profiles at individual installations, alternatively using one clustering
   technique among DBSCAN, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), K-means
   algorithm (KMA), and spectral clustering (SC). The intermediate levels
   of the hierarchy reconstruct the overall EV load and PV generation
   profiles through a proposed frequentist combination of the lower-level
   profiles. The upper level of the hierarchy characterizes the overall net
   load through a novel approach based on the quantile convolution of the
   intermediate-level EV and PV profiles. Real EV load and PV generation
   data are used to evaluate the performance of the presented hierarchical
   methodology, with relative fitting improvements between 1\% and 8\%
   (compared to a two-level hierarchical benchmark) and between 16\% and
   29\% (compared to a direct, non-hierarchical benchmark).},

Abstract = {In recent past, the number of electric vehicles (EVs) have increased
   significantly due to their various advantages to environment. With the
   proper charging and discharging of EVs with vehicle-to-grid (V2G),
   electrical system can get controllable storage/generations and at the

   dispatch strategy to determine, when and at what rate EV battery should
   charge/discharge in order to maximize profits to EV owners and
   responding to power system's requirements while considering the effect
   of renewable DG power availability. This objective depends on many
   criteria like buying and selling price of energy, battery state of
   charge (SoC), Renewable DG power availability, and load leveling. To
   solve these, a new multi-criteria decision analysis method,
   Probabilistic Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (p-ELECTRE), is
   developed. The proposed optimal dispatch strategy is applied to 100 and
   200 EV fleets with random travel plan. Further, the effect of these
   fleets with optimal dispatch strategy is tested on IEEE 33 bus
   distribution system with added DGs. Furthermore, optimal power dispatch
   of DGs in EV-rich distribution system is obtained by BAT optimization
   algorithm (BOA). The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and

Abstract = {This article presents a coordinated planning strategy for renewable
   energy sources (RESs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in unbalanced
   microgrids. The approach aims to mitigate voltage unbalance, reduce
   power losses, alleviate feeder congestion, and maximize the hosting

   employing smart inverter control for photovoltaic (PV) and ESS
   inverters, the strategy enhances the integration of additional RESs
   while minimizing power exchange between operational zones and the
   utility grid (UG). To achieve such an ambitious goal, smart inverter
   control functions are employed, including combined mode, volt-var (VV),
   volt-watt (VW) for Photovoltaic (PV) inverters, and VW for ESS
   inverters. The IEEE 123-bus test system, divided into six operational
   zones, is used as a case study, incorporating plug-in electric vehicle
   (PEV) demand and wind-based distributed generation (DG). A metaheuristic
   algorithm is developed for optimal DG and ESS deployment using MATLAB
   and OpenDSS. The results demonstrate significant improvements, including
   a 16\% reduction in feeder congestion, a 150\% increase in PV

Abstract = {The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) is an inevitable trend to
   realize transportation electrification. However, the increasing charging
   demand of EVs also brings challenges to future smart grids. To cope with
   the EV diffusion, this paper presents an adaptive fast charging station
   (FCS) strategy that considers the integrated network planning and
   quality of service (QoS) guarantee. First, based on the EV diffusion
   model and the proposed EV-integrated traffic assignment model, the
   charging demands at different regions and stages are forecasted. Based
   on the predicted spatial and temporal EV charging demand, a multistage
   stochastic distribution expansion planning model is presented, where the
   distribution network assets and FCSs are jointly considered. To
   guarantee the quality of the fast-charging services under EV diffusion,
   a QoS assessment is conducted based on the average waiting time and the
   average number of dissatisfied leaves. Finally, the proposed planning
   model allows several alternatives at both the distribution and
   transmission levels. The cost of electricity network expansion planning
   is considered as the adaptive cost arisen from the EV diffusion and the
   increase of the other electrical loads. We aim to find a planning
   strategy that can adapt to different penetration levels of EVs. The
   proposed framework and methodology are verified on the IEEE 24-bus power
   system encompassing 6 IEEE 33-bus distribution networks. It is found out
   that the proposed strategy shows superiority in both QoS and total

Abstract = {This paper proposes a centralized energy management system for low
   voltage (LV) distribution networks. The main contribution of this model
   is to manage the energy serving at the local energy communities in the
   presence of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Unlocking the
   demand response potential by the EVSE at the distribution network with
   the contribution of the active residential prosumers has been
   investigated in this study under different operational planning
   scenarios. The developed model is based on the multi-temporal optimal
   power flow (MTOPF) concept while the unbalanced nature of LV networks
   has been addressed using unbalanced power flow equations. The aggregator
   can effectively manage the optimal charging of electric vehicles (EVs)
   by home and public chargers available at the distribution network.
   Simulation results on a modified unbalanced LV network illustrate that
   the optimal operation of EVSE minimizes the electricity costs of
   end-users. The simulation results show that the operating costs and
   systems losses reduce by 9.22\% and 43.45\%, respectively. These results
   have been obtained considering the switching actions and 100\% PV power

Abstract = {Designing a hybrid powertrain remains a complex task. It is an intricate

   that tries to answer a part of this need. Starting from a set of chosen
   components, the methodology automatically generates all the possible
   graphs of architectures using constraint-programming techniques. A
   tailored representation is developed to picture the graphs. They are
   then transformed into other types of representation (tables describing
   the connections and the powertrain modes). Based on these
   representations, the architectures are automatically filtered and the
   most promising ones are selected. They are automatically assessed and
   optimized using a specifically developed general hybrid model that
   calculates the performance and fuel consumption of all the generated
   architectures. This model is inserted inside a bi-level optimization
   process: a Genetic Algorithm is used on the sizing and components level,

Abstract = {Electrified transportation technology has matured in different parts of
   the globe. However, this technology is in an advent stage in the Indian
   market. Due to this fact, a lot more challenges are being encountered in
   the development of electrified transportation in India; with the

   In this study, the techno-economic analysis of different solar-based
   charging schemes that are available in the existing environment and
   present a modest, economical and reliable method of charging an electric
   vehicle (EV) )(e.g. e-rickshaw) through a solar panel that ultimately
   enhances the driving range and overall reliability of the system has
   been done. To validate the performance, the prototype of
   vehicle-integrated photovoltaic (PV) charging system has been developed
   and test results are demonstrated. Economic analysis is done based on
   the yearly average solar irradiance profile in Aligarh, India. Further,
   this work presents a comparative analysis of CO2 emission for 100km
   driving range from the EVs charge by different charging schemes and

Abstract = {The spatiotemporal distribution of pollutants plays a significant role
   on their impact on ecosystems and human health. This article presents a
   strategy for calculating spatiotemporal operational emissions (OEs) of
   road transportation and the electric grid to quantify the impact of
   transportation electrification. Emissions from internal combustion
   engine vehicles and offset emissions from electric vehicles (EVs) are
   considered using actual transportation networks and travel data. The
   spatiotemporal charging demand for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EVs
   is estimated in a behaviorally informed way and mapped to electrical
   buses within the power grid and an ac optimal power flow with unit
   commitment is solved. The methodology is demonstrated with ten scenarios
   simulated on a grid with 7000 electrical buses geographically sited in
   Texas, created with actual generator data for the 2020 grid, and a
   future case, including anticipated generator updates by 2030. Results
   show overall transportation emission reductions in daily OEs of up to
   20\%-30\% for all pollutants studied, outweighing the increase in
   emissions from the electric grid. Considering emissions on an hourly
   basis, up to approximately 1000\% reduction in CO emissions is observed.},

Abstract = {Demand response programs are currently being proposed as a solution to
   deal with issues related to peak demand and to improve the operation of
   the electric power system. In the demand response paradigm, electric
   utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a
   compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity
   consumption. In this paper, a dynamic energy management framework, based
   on highly resolved energy consumption models, is used to simulate
   automated residential demand response. The models estimate the
   residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies
   consumer energy use behavior, thus providing an accurate estimation of
   the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all
   of the controllable appliances, including plug-in electric vehicles, is
   found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures. Recently,
   time-varying electricity rate plans have been proposed by electric
   utilities as an incentive to their customers with the objective of
   re-shaping the aggregate demand. Large-scale simulations are performed
   to analyze and quantitatively assess the impact of demand response
   programs using different electricity price structures. Results show that
   simple time-varying electricity price structures, coupled with
   large-scale adoption of automated energy management systems, might
   create pronounced rebound peaks in the aggregate residential demand. To
   cope with the rebound peaks created by the synchronization of the
   individual residential demands, innovative electricity price
   structures-called Multi-TOU and Multi-CPP-are proposed.},

Volume = {10},

Pages = {2499-2510},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {A new bilevel optimization framework is developed for the optimal
   deployment of wireless charging lanes (WCLs) in coupled transportation
   and power distribution networks (PDNs), with explicit incorporation of:
   1) the impact of deployment decisions on the traffic flow and charging
   demand of electric vehicles (EVs) and 2) the total charging power limit
   of WCL infrastructure. At the upper level, a distribution company
   decides the optimal deployment of WCL, subject to PDN constraints. With
   the upper-level WCL deployment decisions, in the lower level, each EV
   makes optimal routing and charging decisions to minimize the sum of its
   travel and charging costs. The proposed bilevel model is reformulated to
   a single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPECs)
   by replacing the lower-level problem with its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
   optimality conditions. A simplified special ordered set Type 1
   (SOS1)-based method is developed to linearize the complementary
   conditions, avoiding the selection of a proper big constant (as in the
   big- M method). Numerical simulations on a Hong Kong transportation
   network (TN) and the IEEE 118-node test system demonstrate that the
   proposed bilevel framework reduces the vehicle owner cost by 8\% and
   5.3\%, compared with the single-level and multiobjective planning
   frameworks. Ignorance of the WCL total charging power limit can lead to
   46\%-107\% deviation from the optimal deployed WCL length when the
   wireless charging EV adoption rate ranges from 15\% to 30\%.},

Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are getting increased attention due to their
   potential as reliable sources of transportation. In addition, EVs can be
   employed as a temporary energy storage system (ESS) in electrical power
   systems using the grid-to-vehicle (G2V), charging phase, and
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G), discharging phase, technologies. Renewable energy
   resources (RERs) are a clean and sustainable form of energy but are
   often intermittent in nature. Integrating ESS with RERs can mitigate the
   unpredictable fluctuations of the electrical power generated from RERs,
   but the investment cost of installing ESS is often high. In this
   article, we investigate the financial benefit obtained from using EVs as
   a temporary ESS in a microgrid (MG) integrated with a Photovoltaic (PV)
   plant. The problem formulation considers the capital cost of the EV
   charging stations (EVCSs), feed-in tariff (FIT), and incentives given to
   the EVs' owners. A planning algorithm is developed to find the required
   number of EVCSs needed to maximize the profit of the suggested system.
   The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using the
   Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) MG. Four different
   final state of charge (SC) of EV scenarios are considered. Results show
   that the suggested system can be economically and technically feasible.
   Employing EVs, in G2V and V2G schemes, decreases the MG dependency on
   the grid and yields annual profit as well.},

Abstract = {Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) that combine lithium-ion batteries
   and supercapacitors are considered as an attractive solution to overcome
   the drawbacks of battery-only energy storage systems, such as high cost,
   low power density, and short cycle life, which hinder the popularity of
   electric vehicles. A properly sized HESS and an implementable real-time
   power management system are of great importance to achieve satisfactory
   driving mileage and battery cycle life. However, dimensioning and power
   management problems are quite complicated and challenging in practice.
   To address these challenges, this article proposes a bilevel
   multiobjective design and control framework with the nondominated
   sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II and fuzzy logic control (FLC) as key
   components, to obtain an optimal sized HESS and the corresponding
   optimal real-time power management system based on FLC simultaneously.
   In particular, a vectorized fuzzy inference system is devised, which
   allows large-scale fuzzy logic controllers to run in parallel, thereby
   improving optimization efficiency. Pareto optimal results of different
   HESSs incorporating both optimal design and control parameters are
   obtained efficiently thanks to the vectorization. An example solution
   chosen from the Pareto front shows that the proposed method can achieve
   a competitive number of covered laps while improving the battery cycle

Abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) technology with a vehicle to grid (V2G) property
   is used in power systems to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, reduce
   peak load of the distribution system, provide ancillary service, etc. In
   addition, demand response (DR) programs as an effective strategy can
   provide an opportunity for consumers to play a significant role in the
   planning and operation of a smart distribution company (SDISCO) by
   reducing or shifting their demand, especially during the on-peak period.
   In this paper, the optimal operation of a SDISCO is evaluated, including
   renewable energy resources (RERs) along with EV parking lots (PLs). RER
   and PL uncertainties and a suitable charging/discharging schedule of EVs
   are also considered. Furthermore, price-based DR programs and
   incentive-based DR programs are used for operational scheduling. To
   achieve this aim, a techno-economic formulation is developed in which
   the SDISCO acts as the owner of RERs and PLs. Moreover, DR programs are
   prioritized by using the technique for order preference by similarity to
   ideal solution method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried
   out to investigate different factors that affect the operational
   scheduling of the SDISCO. The proposed model is tested on the IEEE
   15-bus distribution system over a 24-h period, and the results prove the
   effectiveness of the model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The battery swapping mode of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to play
   an essential role in transportation and power systems. Plenty of
   batteries are managed by the battery swapping and charging stations
   (BSCSs) as the core assets. Proper inventory scale and
   charging/discharging control of batteries are essential to the planning
   and operation of BSCSs. This paper addresses two critical aspects of
   BSCS batteries: the optimal amount of inventory batteries and the
   tradeoff between the initial number of depleted and fully-charged
   batteries at the beginning of each scheduling horizon. Aiming at these,
   the time coupling between initial inventory, charging/discharging
   strategy, and swapping time sequence is analyzed. Afterward, it
   establishes the initial inventory based charging/ discharging (IIC)
   model. The uncertain swapping demand is fully considered by utilizing a
   data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach with an
   improved K-means clustering algorithm. A duality-free
   column-and-constraint generation (C\&CG) algorithm solves the problem
   iteratively. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the IIC
   model and show that the obtained optimization results achieve the
   balance of economy and robustness. Moreover, the impact of battery
   technology development on inventory batteries is analyzed, and

Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {For plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), using a hybrid energy
   storage system (HESS) instead of a single battery system can prolong the
   battery life and reduce the vehicle cost. To develop a PHEV with HESS,
   it is a key link to obtain the optimal size of the power supply and
   energy system that can meet the load requirements of a driving cycle.
   Since little effort has been dedicated to simultaneously performing the
   component sizing of PHEV and HESS, this paper proposes an approach based
   on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to simultaneously
   determine the sizes of the engine, motor, battery and supercapacitor
   (SC) in a PHEV with HESS. The drivetrain cost is minimized in a
   different all-electric range (AER)-and depends on the battery type-while
   ensuring the driving performance requirements. In addition, the effects
   of the power system and drive cycle on the component sizes were analyzed
   and compared. The simulation results show that the cost of the PHEV
   drivetrain with the Ni-MH battery/SC HESS is reduced by up to 12.21\%
   when compared to the drivetrain with the Li-ion battery/SC HESS. The
   drivetrain cost is reduced by 8.79\% when compared to analysis-based
   optimization. The type of power supply system and drive cycle can
   significantly affect the optimization results.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The rapid uptake of electric vehicles presents both opportunities and
   challenges for modern power systems. As charging demand increases,
   intelligent and data-driven approaches are essential to predict and
   manage future grid impacts. This paper presents a probabilistic and
   data-driven approach for generating realistic electric vehicle charging
   profiles, which can be integrated into probabilistic load flow
   simulations to assess their effect on grid capacity. In contrast to many
   existing studies that focus on low-voltage grids, this work targets the
   sub-transmission grid, analyzing the impact of aggregated charging
   demand. The approach is applied to a Swedish sub-transmission grid using
   a combination of real-world data: travel statistics, demographic data,
   charger usage rates, and two empirical home charging datasets, one
   representing uncoordinated charging, and another incorporating smart
   charging technologies. The methodology generates synthetic but realistic
   charging demand profiles, which are coupled to a full-scale grid model
   to evaluate the system under 100 \% fleet electrification. Results show
   that substantial congestion may emerge in the primary substation
   transformers, which may, to some extent, be mitigated by adopting
   planned or intelligent charging strategies. By combining real-world data
   with a detailed grid model and a probabilistic modeling approach, the
   study lays a foundation for analyzing grid impacts under high EV
   penetration and supports the development of flexibility services to
   inform more proactive grid planning.},

   as possible. The objective function is subjected to the
   network-constrained unit commitment model, up and down reserve
   requirements and the proposed VPP constraints. This method is taking
   into account the uncertainty in system and VPP loads, day-ahead market
   energy and reserve price and WF power generation. This strategy is
   applied as hybrid stochastic-robust scheduling to the VPP at the
   electrical power transmission level, where the scenario-based stochastic
   programming models the uncertainty of day-ahead market prices, and the
   bounded uncertainty-based robust optimization has been adopted to model
   the uncertainties related to the load and WF power. Scheme has been
   tested on IEEE systems. According to the obtained results, the proposed
   coordination of VPPs in the mentioned markets demonstrates capability of
   suggested strategy.
   Energy management of a virtual power plant (VPP) that consists of wind
   farm, energy storage systems and a demand response program is discussed
   in the present study. The introduced strategy is realized at the
   electrical power transmission level and takes into account the
   collaboration between VPPs in day-ahead energy and reserve markets.image},

Abstract = {The idea of renewable resource integration influences the demand-supply
   balance significantly. The effort taken to diminish the deviation in
   demand-supply balance is greatly influenced by demand response (DR)
   strategy. In this analysis, the concept of DR is incorporated via the
   approach of load management. The optimal scheduling of the load
   considering the available energy helps to avoid unessential load
   shedding. The DR strategy of load shifting is suggested at different
   levels in accordance with the nature of load and real-time price. The
   profit of the utility is enhanced by providing the customer the
   flexibility to schedule their load. The curtailment of load can be
   avoided by increased customer participation in the suggested DR
   programs. The operating system is designed to be both efficient and
   effective by utilizing the real-time tariff profile of electricity to
   plan the generation of renewable energy, energy storage systems that
   include electric vehicles, and the utilization of grid power. The
   scalability and generalization of the proposed DR approach make it
   suitable for large-scale power systems that integrate renewable energy
   sources. The validation of the proposed method using reliability
   analysis ensures the effectiveness of the formulated DR. The proposed
   method is tested under two different scenarios and topologies on the
   IEEE-33 bus system and the results accomplished are promising.},

Abstract = {Conventional transmission expansion planning (TEP) has evolved with the
   increasing influence of distributed generations (DGs) and electric
   vehicles (EVs). This increases uncertainty in power systems. On the
   other hand, reactive power plays a key role in voltage stability, so
   modeling reactive power planning in TEP is very important. The amount of
   reactive power is a determining factor regarding the stability of the
   network voltage and in case of shortage, occurrence of some events may
   endanger the voltage stability. This research aims at proposing a hybrid
   TEP and reactive power planning for the first time. Furthermore, the
   impact of wind, PV power plants, and EVs, as the common sources of
   uncertainties, are included. The ultimate goal of HTEP-RPP is to find
   the transmission line candidates that meet the reactive power
   requirements. The simulation case studies on IEEE 24- and 118- buses
   confirm that the TEP based on DCPF may lead to some unreliable operating
   conditions due to violating the voltage constraints. In this case, the
   HTEP-RPP results, by applying the imperialist competitive algorithm
   (ICA), are more comprehensive and effective than the results obtained by
   gravitational search algorithm (GSA), for the studied problem or even
   the popular TEP solutions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, joint energy procurement and demand response is studied
   from the perspective of the operator of a power system. The operator
   procures energy from both renewable energy sources (RESs) and the spot
   market. We observe the fact that the RESs may incur considerable
   infrastructure cost. This cost is taken into account and the optimal
   planning of renewables is examined by controlling the investment in RES
   infrastructures. Due to the uncertainty of renewables, the operator can
   also purchase energy directly from the spot market to compensate for the
   possible deficit incurred by the realization of the random renewable
   energy. By setting appropriate prices, the operator sells the collected
   energy to heterogeneous end users with different demand response
   characteristics. We model the decision making process of the operator as
   a two-stage optimization problem. The optimal decisions on the renewable
   deployment, energy purchase from the spot market, and pricing schemes
   are derived. Several solution structures are observed and a
   computationally efficient algorithm, requiring only closed-form
   calculation and simple bisection search, is proposed to compute the
   optimal decisions. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to
   verify the optimality of the proposed algorithm and the solution
   structures observed theoretically. In particular, the impact of
   renewable penetration and the importance of its optimal design are
   highlighted.},

Abstract = {Based on the large-scale penetration of electric vehicles (EV) into the
   building cluster, a multi-objective optimal strategy considering the
   coordinated dispatch of EV is proposed, for improving the safe and
   economical operation problems of distribution network. The system power
   loss and node voltage excursion can be effectively reduced, by taking
   measures of time-of-use (TOU) price mechanism bonded with the reactive
   compensation of energy storage devices. Firstly, the coordinate
   charging/discharging load model for EV has been established, to obtain a
   narrowed gap between load peak and valley. Next, a multi-objective
   optimization model of the distribution grid is also defined, and the
   active power loss and node voltage fluctuation are chosen to be the
   objective function. For improving the efficiency of optimization
   process, an advanced genetic algorithm associated with elite
   preservation policy is used. Finally, reactive compensation capacity
   supplied by capacitor banks is dynamically determined according to the
   varying building loads. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on the
   IEEE 33-node test case, and the simulation results show that the power
   supply pressure can be obviously relieved by introducing the coordinated
   charging/discharging behavior of EV; in the meantime, via reasonable
   planning of the compensation capacitor, the remarkably lower active
   power loss and voltage excursion can be realized, ensuring the safe and
   economical operation of the distribution system.},

Abstract = {Rechargeable grid-scale batteries are suitable and mature technology for
   energy storage in active distribution networks. Battery energy storage
   (BES) units have many advantages and are used for several purposes in
   electric systems and distribution grids. They are used not only for peak
   shaving and voltage regulation, but also for reliability enhancement and
   dispatching the renewable-based distributed generation (DG) sources.
   However, BES technologies are still expensive and need to be employed
   optimally to prevent excess investment cost. Optimal planning of BES is
   a complex approach that determines the type, location, capacity and
   power rating of energy storage units. The optimization should handle the
   uncertain conditions and it requires to develop the appropriate models

   planning methodologies are presented. Firstly the optimization problem
   is formulated considering different economic perspectives. Then the
   approaches and strategies for solving the combinatorial problem are
   described. In this way, both the probabilistic and possibilistic methods

Pages = {1-9},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {In this study, a heuristics-based optimisation methodology for a
   day-ahead unit commitment (UC) model in microgrids is proposed. The
   model aims to schedule the power among the different microgrid units
   while minimising the operating costs together with the CO(2)emissions
   produced. A storage device is added where the charge and discharge
   schedule is calculated according to both objectives. In addition, as a
   part of the demand side participation strategy, a charging schedule was
   determined for the electric vehicles (EV) in order to increase the
   system security and further reduce the costs and emissions. A congestion
   management approach is also introduced, which eliminates congestions by
   effective unit scheduling according to congestion signals provided by
   the distribution system operators. The complete day-ahead time horizon
   is divided in 96 time steps (each with a 15 min time span), which makes
   the UC problem more complicated. The studied system includes renewable
   energy resources, a storage unit, two microturbines, a fuel cell and
   EVs. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is robust and is
   able to reduce the microgrid operating costs and emissions by optimal
   scheduling of the microgrid units, and is able to take into account
   local congestion problems.},

Abstract = {To achieve net-zero emissions in aviation industry with defined CO2
   mitigation objectives in ``Flightpath 2050 \& DPRIME;, electric
   propulsion system becomes an attractive technology. Many electric
   aircraft (EA) prototypes with a fully electrically powered propulsion
   system for short-haul commuting air transport have been designed in
   recent years. Planning and designing the ground power systems and
   associated electric aircraft charging facilities are also essential for
   realising aviation electrification. In this work, a bi-objective
   infrastructure planning framework for airport microgrid to accommodate
   parking lot electric vehicles (EVs) and EA is developed, and the impact
   of V2G on the airport microgrid is assessed. The dispatching problem of
   the airport microgrid is formulated as a heuristic optimisation problem,
   and the NSGA-II algorithm is adopted to find the Pareto Fronts and
   optimal solutions. There are two different scheduling strategies for
   charging EA: plug-in charge and battery swap. The economic and
   technological assessments for both strategies are conducted and
   compared. The results show that adopting V2G strategy can improve the
   airport microgrid economic performance. In general, the EA plug-in
   charge strategy performs better than the EA battery strategy in terms of
   microgrid resilience, while the EA battery swap strategy can reduce the

Volume = {11},
Pages = {16250-16270},
Abstract = {The new era of the energy sector has already begun, and therefore, new
   challenges need to be tackled. A major challenge that residential
   distribution grids are going to encounter with the integration of
   photovoltaic (PV) panels and electric vehicles (EVs) is the
   unsynchronized new demand and the time-limited production of distributed
   generation, in combination with space limitations. Therefore, the
   necessity of energy storage systems (ESSs) is more than evident. ESSs
   have excessive manufacturing costs, implying that the purchase cost for
   residential users can be prohibitive. In the present work, a distributed
   optimal small-scale PV energy system sizing strategy is proposed, by
   considering the individual energy needs of each residence and their EVs.
   The strategy is formulated based on the demand of the households and
   EVs' charging. By enabling the fuzzy cognitive maps theory, a graph is
   designed, aiming to establish the correlation among the individual
   energy parameters and the characteristics of the renewable energy
   sources (RES). The optimization results reveal that the adopted hybrid
   approach can reduce the energy cost significantly, up to almost 40\%,
   while enabling distribution system operators (DSOs) to incorporate
   additional loads, without the need for network expansion. Finally, based
   on the extracted results, a short discussion about the concept of EVs'
   charging by residential RES is presented.},

Abstract = {The modern power distribution system is connected to many loads,
   affecting the power system reliability and causing more power loss. One
   of the new loads is the battery charging station for electric vehicles

   results show that the installation of 0.3167 MVar capacitors for Plug-in

   comparison, the installation of 0.2893 MVar capacitors for the
   Pantograph electric bus systems reduces the power loss by 0.5459 MWh.
   The installation of 0.2922 MVar capacitors for the Battery swapping
   systems reduces the power loss of 0.5517 MWh. The installation of shunt

Pages = {133668-133680},
Abstract = {This paper presents an optimal operation algorithm for a grid-connected
   microgrid that incorporates renewable energy sources (RESs), plug-in
   electric vehicle (PEV) charging/discharging stations, and local loads.
   The aim of this work is to not only propose a microgrid operating
   algorithm but also implement it within the microgrid energy management
   system. The primary objective of the proposed algorithm is to reduce the
   overall operational cost of the microgrid while minimizing the PEV
   charging bills simultaneously. To this end, we propose an adaptive PEV
   power charging/discharging and power exchange (grid exporting/importing)
   scheduling strategy that accounts for the uncertainty of RES power
   generation, loads, and electric pricing. To address the dynamic arrival
   of PEVs, we propose an online optimization scheme using an adaptive
   rolling horizon framework. The size of the rolling window is adjusted in
   each time step to adapt to the dynamic nature of the PEV charging
   period. Additionally, we propose the design of a dynamic pricing model
   for PEV charging and discharging to achieve power system balance within
   the microgrid, thereby optimizing operating costs and minimizing PEV
   charging bills further. Through simulations, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed strategies, which are expected to benefit
   both the microgrid operators and PEV owners.},

Abstract = {Electrical energy production from renewable energy sources and
   electrification of consumer energy demand are developments in the
   ongoing energy transition. These developments urge the demand for
   flexibility in low voltage distribution networks, on the one hand caused
   by the intermittency of renewable energy sources, and on the other hand
   by the high power demand of battery electric vehicles and heat pumps.
   One of the foremost ways to create flexibility is by using energy
   storage systems. This paper proposes a method to first optimize the
   siting, power and capacity rating, technology, and operation of energy
   storage systems based on the technical and economic value. Secondly the
   method can be used to make cost-and time-based network planning
   decisions between network upgrades and network upgrade deferral by
   energy storage systems. To demonstrate the proposed method, study cases
   are analyzed of five low voltage distribution networks with different
   penetrations of photovoltaics, heat pumps and battery electric vehicles.
   The optimal energy storage systems in the study cases are: flow
   batteries sited at over 50\% of the cable length with a high capacity
   rating per euro. With the current state of energy storage system
   development, network upgrade deferral is up to 61\% cheaper than network
   upgrades in the study cases. The energy storage systems can offer
   additional value by reducing the peak loading of the medium voltage grid
   which is not taken into account in this research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Optimal Layout Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
   Considering Road-Electricity Coupling Effects},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With the advancement of dual-carbon goals and the construction of new
   types of power systems, the proportion of electric vehicle charging
   stations (EVCSs) in the coupling system of power distribution and
   transportation networks is gradually increasing. However, the surge in
   charging demand not only causes voltage fluctuations and a decline in
   power quality but also leads to tension in the power grid load in some
   areas. The complexity of urban road networks further increases the
   challenge of charging station planning. Although laying out charging
   stations in areas with high traffic flow can better meet traffic
   demands, it may also damage power quality due to excessive grid load. In
   response to this problem, this paper proposes an optimized layout plan
   for electric vehicle charging stations considering the coupling effects
   of roads and electricity. By using section power flow to extract dynamic
   data from the power distribution network and comparing the original
   daily load curves of the power grid and electric vehicles, this paper
   plans reasonable capacity and charging/discharging schemes for EVCSs. It
   considers the impact of the charging and discharging characteristics of
   EVCSs on the power grid while satisfying the peak-shaving and
   valley-filling regulation benefits. Combined with the traffic road
   network, the optimization objectives include optimizing the voltage
   deviation, transmission line margin, network loss, traffic flow, and
   service range of charging stations. The Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO)
   algorithm is used for solving, and the optimal layout plan for electric
   vehicle charging stations is obtained. Finally, through road-electricity
   coupling network simulation verification, the proposed optimal planning
   scheme effectively expands the charging service range of electric
   vehicles, with a coverage rate of 83.33\%, alleviating users' charging
   anxiety and minimizing the impact on the power grid, verifying the
   effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme.},

Abstract = {With the development of smart grid, energy consumption on residence will
   play an important role in the electricity market, while the Home Energy
   Management System (HEMS) has huge potential to help energy conservation.
   In this study, a practical HEMS model with renewable energy, storage
   devices and plug-in electric vehicles, considering the battery
   sustainability and the full utilisation of the renewable energy, is
   first established. Then, according to the combinations of the genetic
   algorithm (GA) and the multi-constrained integer programming method, an
   improved GA is proposed, which goal is to minimise the electricity
   purchase and maximise the renewable energy utilisation. Finally, it is
   demonstrated by an example that the proposed method is significant in
   cost saving and reducing energy wastes. To verify the performances of
   the proposed algorithm, the numerical results indicate that the proposed
   algorithm has high computational efficiency and good robustness. In
   addition, it can avoid the disadvantages easy to trap at a local optimal
   point, and are insensitive to initial solutions. The effect of the
   storage device on system property and the sensitivity of cost savings
   versus demand response, size of the battery, and the electricity price

Title = {Adaptive Distributionally Robust Planning for Renewable-Powered Fast
   Charging Stations Under Decision-Dependent EV Diffusion Uncertainty},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Pages = {5853-5870},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {When deploying fast charging stations (FCSs) to support long-distance
   trips of electric vehicles (EVs), there exist indirect network effects:
   while the gradual diffusion of EVs directly influences the timing and
   capacities of FCS allocation, the decisions for FCS allocations, in
   turn, impact the drivers' willingness to adopt EVs. This interplay, if
   neglected, can result in uncovered EVs and security issues and even
   hinder the effective diffusion of EVs. In this paper, we explicitly
   incorporate this interdependence by quantifying EV adoption rates as
   decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) using decision-dependent
   ambiguity sets (DDASs). Then, a two-stage decision-dependent
   distributionally robust FCS planning (D3R-FCSP) model is developed for
   adaptively deploying FCSs with on-site sources and expanding the coupled
   distribution network. A multi-period capacitated arc cover-path cover
   (MCACPC) model is incorporated to capture the EVs' recharging patterns
   to ensure the feasibility of FCS locations and capacities. To resolve
   the nonlinearity and nonconvexity, the D3R-FCSP model is equivalently
   reformulated into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming by
   exploiting its strong duality and applying the McCormick envelope.
   Finally, case studies highlight the superior out-of-sample performances
   of our model in terms of security and cost-efficiency. Furthermore, the
   byproduct of accelerated EV adoption through an implicit positive
   feedback loop is highlighted.},

   System Using a Controlled Current Source Cascade Architecture},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {150898-150913},
Abstract = {The energy sources in a Hybrid Energy Storage System are coupled by a
   DC-DC converter. Nevertheless, this device's mass is irrelevant when
   evaluating the performance of such a system in terms of density, so it
   must be reduced to achieve maximum performance. This can be achieved
   with the solution presented in this paper: a coupling architecture based
   on a controlled current source, in which the DC-DC converter's processed
   power depends on the voltage difference between the two sources. If this
   difference is zero, so is the power processed by the converter.
   Minimizing this power leads to a reduction of the converter's mass and
   volume, increasing system performance. In this paper, the controlled
   current source cascade architecture combines two lithium-ion batteries
   to supply a limited-range electric vehicle. Its operation is addressed
   and validated by simulation and experimental results. For the
   experimental validation, the batteries and the load were emulated by
   power supplies, with a 2 kg, 3.3 kW evaluation board serving as DC-DC
   converter. The findings reveal that the examined architecture enables a
   substantial reduction in the converter's sizing power, up to a factor of
   14 compared to a conventional solution commonly seen in the literature.},

Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are on the path to becoming a solution to the
   emissions released by the internal combustion engine vehicles that are
   on the road. EV charging management integration requires a smart grid
   platform that allows for communication and control between the
   aggregator, consumer and grid. This study presents an operational
   strategy for PV-assisted charging stations (PVCSs) that allows the EV to
   be charged primarily by PV energy, followed by the EV station's battery
   storage (BS) and the grid. Multi-Aggregator collaborative scheduling is
   considered that includes a monetary penalty on the aggregator for any
   unscheduled EVs. The impact of the PVCS is compared to the case with no
   PV/BS is included. A variation in the PV profile is included in the
   evaluation to assess its impact on total profits. Profit results are
   compared in cases of minimum, average and maximum PV energy output. The
   results indicate that the inclusion of penalties due to unscheduled EVs
   resulted in lowered profits. Further, the profits experienced an
   increase as the number of EVs scheduled through PV/BS increased,
   implying that a lesser percentage of EVs are scheduled by the grid when
   a greater amount of PV and battery energy are available.},

   Considering Carbon Footprint of Construction},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {161180-161193},
Abstract = {The growing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in urban areas aims to
   reduce fuel costs and Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from conventional
   transportation. To support this transition, the expansion of Electric
   Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) has become essential to meet the
   increasing charging demand. However, although EV usage can reduce CO2
   emissions in the transportation sector, existing planning approaches
   often overlook the CO(2 )emissions generated by the construction of
   EVCSs. This omission may undermine the environmental benefits of EV
   adoption, as the cost of mitigating construction-related emissions could
   offset the savings from reduced transportation emissions. To address
   this issue, this study proposes a novel EVCS expansion framework that
   integrates construction-related CO(2 )emission cost into the overall
   optimization model. The proposed approach jointly considers the costs
   incurred by Charging Station Owners (CSOs), EV users, and the
   environmental impact from EVCS construction. A realistic urban road
   network and EV charging behavior are modeled in detail, and Binary
   Differential Evolution (BDE) is employed to determine the optimal sizing
   and locations of EVCSs. The results demonstrate that incorporating
   construction-related CO(2 )emission costs leads to a total cost
   reduction of 2.06\% compared to conventional methods that do not
   consider such CO(2 )emissions. These findings emphasize the importance
   of incorporating environmental externalities, such as
   construction-related CO(2 )emissions, into infrastructure planning to
   reduce long-term costs, mitigate potential carbon tax impacts, and
   support cost-effective and sustainable EVCS deployment.},

   Models: Slovenian use case},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
   electric vehicles (EVs), and heat pumps (HPs) presents significant
   challenges for low-voltage (LV) distribution networks, requiring
   advanced planning methodologies to ensure grid reliability and
   cost-effectiveness. However, existing studies primarily focus on
   individual network simulations, which are computationally intensive and
   lack scalability. Moreover, most research relies on synthetic network
   models rather than real-world distribution system operator (DSO) data,
   limiting practical applicability. This study addresses these gaps by
   developing a Reference Network Model (RNM) tailored to the Slovenian LV
   distribution system. The first objective is to establish reference
   radial network models based on real DSO data, enabling simulation
   generalization across the entire distribution network. Using k-medoids
   clustering, LV networks are categorized into representative groups,
   facilitating efficient analysis without exhaustive individual network
   simulations. The second objective is to develop a generalization
   methodology that extrapolates simulation results from reference networks
   to the entire LV distribution system. Unlike conventional RNM
   applications, this approach integrates real-world Slovenian DSO data and
   incorporates scenario-based reinforcement planning to address the
   evolving impact of DERs, EVs, and HPs. A key result is cost-benefit
   analysis, which evaluates investment requirements and operational
   savings, offering insights for policymakers and DSOs to optimize network
   planning. Simulation results indicate that most required reinforcements
   will focus on LV line upgrades, particularly in regions with long
   feeders and high demand growth. The findings demonstrate that the
   proposed methodology significantly reduces computational burdens while
   maintaining high accuracy in predicting network reinforcement needs,
   making it a scalable and practical tool for long-term distribution
   system planning.},

Title = {A Demand Factor Analysis for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the factors influencing the power consumption of
   electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and develops a methodology
   for determining the design electrical loads of EV charging stations
   (EVCSs). A comprehensive review of existing research on demand factor
   (DF) calculations for EVCSs is presented, highlighting discrepancies in
   current approaches and identifying key influencing factors. To address
   these gaps, a simulation model was developed in Python 3.11.9,
   generating minute-by-minute power consumption profiles based on EVCS
   parameters, EV fleet characteristics, and charging behavior patterns. In
   contrast with state-of-the-art methods that often provide limited
   reference values or scenario-specific analyses, this study quantifies
   the influence of key factors and demonstrates that the average number of
   daily charging sessions, EVCS power rating, and the number of charging
   ports are the most significant determinants of DF. For instance,
   increasing the number of sessions from 0.5 to 4 per day raises DF by 2.4
   times, while higher EVCS power ratings reduce DF by 32-56\%. This study
   proposes a practical generalized algorithm for calculating DF
   homogeneous and heterogeneous EVCS groups. The proposed model
   demonstrates superior accuracy (MAPE = 6.01\%, R2 = 0.987) compared with
   existing SOTA approaches, which, when applied to our dataset, yielded
   significantly higher errors (MAPE of 50.36-67.72\%). The derived
   expressions enable efficient planning of distribution networks,
   minimizing overestimation of design loads and associated infrastructure
   costs. This work contributes to the field by quantifying the impact of
   behavioral and technical factors on EVCS power consumption, offering a
   robust tool for grid planners and policymakers to optimize EV charging
   infrastructure deployment.},

Title = {Planning Flexibility With Non-Deferrable Loads Considering Distribution
   Grid Limitations},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {25140-25147},
Abstract = {Non-deferrable loads equipped with distributed energy resources, such as
   solar photovoltaic generation and energy storage, can offer a wide range
   of benefits to the power system, including load leveling, hedging
   against forecast uncertainty, and ancillary services. This paper
   presents a techno-economic approach to optimally equip a flexible energy
   resource, namely a battery energy storage system (BESS), with
   non-deferrable loads for capacity enhancement of a distribution grid.
   The proposed approach is generic in applicability, and includes two
   different optimization mathematical models. The first model quantifies
   the needed flexibility with non-deferrable loads, based on a
   consideration of distribution grid limitations, while the second model
   determines the optimal flexibility amount associated with non-deferrable
   loads considering investor profitability. Thereafter, a distribution
   operations model is developed to evaluate the impact of non-deferrable
   loads, equipped with an optimal size of BESS, on the distribution system
   loading capacity. An example of non-deferrable loads considered in this
   paper is that of the rapid charging loads of plug-in electric vehicles
   (PEVs) that cannot be controlled or shifted due to the short stay of
   PEVs at a charging facility. Hence, a probabilistic model for PEV rapid
   charging loads is first developed. Case studies and simulation findings,
   considering a 32-bus distribution system, demonstrate that the proposed
   approach helps reduces the impact of non-deferrable loads on a
   distribution system and enhances the system power margin, which defers
   the need for system upgrades.},

Title = {Optimal Placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in a
   Distribution Network With Randomly Distributed Rooftop Photovoltaic
   Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {132397-132411},
Abstract = {The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) in today's transport
   sector is gradually leading to the phasing out of petroleum-based
   vehicles. However, the rapid deployment of EVs largely depends on the
   coordinated and fast expansion of EV charging stations (EVCSs). The
   integration of EVCSs in the modern distribution network characterized by
   increased penetration of randomly distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems
   is challenging as they can lead to excessive power losses and voltage
   deviations beyond acceptable limits. In this paper, a hybrid bacterial
   foraging optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization
   (BFOA-PSO) technique is proposed for the optimal placement of EVCSs into
   the distribution network with high penetration of randomly distributed
   rooftop PV systems. The optimization problem is formulated as a
   multi-objective problem minimizing active and reactive power losses,
   average voltage deviation index, and maximizing voltage stability index.
   The IEEE 69 node distribution network is used as the case network. The
   simulation is done using MATLAB to integrate the EVCSs in five cases of
   randomly sized and placed PV systems in the distribution network. For
   all five cases, a minimal increase in power losses is recorded with
   minor changes in the voltage deviation and stability indices due to the
   placement of the EVCSs. But for the voltages of nodes 29 to 48, the
   other node voltages remain unchanged upon placement of the EVCSs. The
   largest increase in power losses due to the EVCSs being brought into the
   network with PVs was noticed in case 3 (from 142.27kW, and 62.90kVar to
   147.65kW, and 72.48kVar).},

Title = {Driving Simulator for Electric Vehicles Using the Markov Chain Monte
   Carlo Method and Evaluation of the Demand Response Effect in Residential
   Houses},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {47654-47663},
Abstract = {It is essential to secure flexible resources in power systems to
   increase the proportion of variable renewable energy generation systems.
   One flexible resource is demand response (DR) of the batteries of
   electric vehicles (EVs). In this study, we propose an electric vehicle
   driving simulator using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and
   an EV demand response evaluation model. The former is a highly versatile
   EV driving simulator that can produce a random driving pattern based on
   actual EV fleet data, taking into account various features. The latter
   is a residential DR evaluation model that minimizes a household
   electricity bill based on the simulated fleet data and enables realistic
   DR operation using three processes: forecasting, planning, and
   operation. The contribution of this paper is to enable evaluation of
   realistic EV battery value in various housing and EV utilization
   combinations. We found that the EV battery control provides an economic
   benefit of US\$62 (5\% of the night-charging case cost) with only charge
   control and US\$370 (31\%) with charge and discharge control, as the
   average expected value based on our assumption of evaluation. Because
   40-kWh EV batteries have a sufficiently large capacity to store surplus
   power from a rooftop PV, they can be operated by determining the
   operation schedule based on a fixed-fee structure without forecasting or
   planning.},

Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {Electrification of the transportation sector through electric vehicles
   (EVs) is promoted by environmentalists and government agencies in order
   to encourage sustainable growth. EVs as a random load may take a toll on
   the stability and reliability of the power system. However, they can
   also help to improve the grid performance if operated in coordination
   with the load profile. In this paper, the impact of EV fleet integration
   in the unbalanced distribution network has been observed. A
   probabilistic EV model for charging and discharging of EVs is proposed,
   in which both the arrival and departure time of EVs is modelled as a
   normal distribution and the distance travelled is modelled as a
   lognormal distribution taking into account the spatial temporal features
   of EV charging. The charging-discharging schedule of EVs is optimized
   using Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the aim of obtaining a flattened load
   profile. The developed algorithm was tested on IEEE 13-bus unbalanced
   test distribution network, and the results show that the optimized EV
   integration has resulted in flattening the load profile (gap between
   maximum and minimum demand reduced to similar to 18 kW), improvement in
   the voltage profile and reduction in the network unbalance as depicted
   by the decrease in the maximum neutral current drawn (similar to 28\%).
   The proposed model can be implemented for practical distribution system
   planning and can be an effective tool in balancing the unbalanced
   network in the era of rapidly increasing EVs in the real-time
   distribution system.},

   systems with coordinated electric vehicle fleets},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {225},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The widespread adaptation of electric vehicles will extend their impact
   from power systems to natural gas and heating networks since these
   energy systems are delicately interconnected. This study investigates
   uncoordinated and coordinated charging control strategies of electric
   vehicle fleets (EVFs) in network -constrained multi-energy systems
   (NMES). A mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model is
   presented to capture the nonlinearities in EVFs battery degradation
   cost, power flow equations of the electric distribution system (EDS) and
   natural gas network (NGN). To deal with uncertain renewable energy
   production, a Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization
   (DRO) framework is applied. Moreover, the behavioral uncertainties in
   EVFs' traveled distance and arrival/departure times are also taken into
   account. The model is implemented on two different NMES sizes (one small
   and one large benchmark systems) to assess the models functionality and
   scalability in real-world applications. The outcomes illustrate how
   smart and uncoordinated EVF charging strategies can impact each of these
   networks, while the proposed DRO model leads a conservative estimation
   over the probability distribution functions of renewable energy
   production. Most notably, using the smart charging strategy led to
   50.55\% reduction in the operational costs of the small test system and
   27.83\% for the large test system. Furthermore, despite the lowered risk
   and heightened reliability, the application with DRO model showed
   23.67\% and 5.88\% higher cost for the small and large systems,
   respectively.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {161},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper introduces a comprehensive and resilient multi-energy system
   (MES) designed for independent planning and real-time implementation. A
   robust daily coordinated planning model is proposed, incorporating
   adjustable optimization with fundamental operational and uncertainty
   constraints. The model integrates various energy sources and systems,
   including photovoltaics, wind turbines, combined heat and power (CHP)
   units, energy storage system (ESS), electric vehicle (EV), electric
   boilers, and power-to-gas (P2G) facilities, to manage electricity,
   natural gas, and heat demands. The objective is to minimize MES
   operational costs while meeting electricity and heat requirements,
   considering renewable energy uncertainties. It includes the development
   of a two-stage flexible robust optimization model that accounts for
   energy equilibrium, capacity constraints, and demand response
   mechanisms. The model incorporates price-based demand response with both
   switchable and interruptible loads, enhancing system controllability and
   flexibility. Additionally, a scenario generation and reduction technique
   based on the Kantorovich distance is employed to effectively manage
   forecast errors and uncertainties. A novel modified Slime Mold Algorithm
   (SMA) is utilized to solve the optimization problem, demonstrating
   superior convergence and computational efficiency compared to
   traditional meta-heuristics. The slime mold algorithm is further
   enhanced with chaos theory, using a sine map to introduce dynamic
   exploration capabilities. The findings indicate that the proposed
   multi-energy system model effectively balances electricity, natural gas,
   and heat loads while accommodating renewable energy fluctuations. The
   enhanced slime mold algorithm provides optimal solutions swiftly,
   ensuring reliable and cost-effective multi-energy system operation.},

Abstract = {To explore the potential of all-round and multiangle voltage and
   reactive power control to reduce losses in a new power system with a
   high proportion of distributed resources connected to a distribution
   network, this study proposes a Volt/VAR optimization method for
   distribution networks using a nondominated sorting dung beetle optimizer
   (NSDBO) and model predictive control (MPC). According to the
   characteristics of the various adjustable resources in the network, they
   are divided into day-ahead and intraday optimizations. The optimization
   process in the day-ahead stage uses the NSDBO to create a discrete
   equipment scheduling plan. The optimization process in the intraday
   stage combines the discrete equipment scheduling plan with the MPC to
   create the scheduling plan for photovoltaics, energy storage, and
   vehicle charging stations. Two-stage optimization scheduling is achieved
   with the lowest discrete equipment regulation cost and minimization of
   network loss and node voltage deviation penalty cost as the optimization
   goal. The feasibility of this method for coordinating various resources
   in the network, processing discrete and continuous variables, and coping
   with the volatility and uncertainty of high-proportion distributed

   Impact on Grid: A Review},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 9},
Abstract = {The growth of EV penetration brings numerous benefits in economic and
   environmental aspects, but it also presents deployment opportunities and
   challenges of EV charging stations. The EV owners benefit from lower
   fuel and operating expenses compared to ICE vehicles because of higher
   efficiency of electric motors reaching it as high as 60-70\%. The
   electric vehicles are intermittent load to the grid since the number of
   users charging the electric vehicle at different charging station at
   different time. Moreover, the increasing EV penetration leads to the
   increase in load requirement on charging stations and will place a
   heavier load on the grid, necessitating the exploration of alternative
   resources. So, it significantly effects on power quality of the
   distribution grid. This charging requirement needs to be effectively
   managed to ensure uninterrupted energy supply for charging EVs
   batteries. By employing a basic charging plan, the estimated system cost
   per vehicle per year in Denmark is \$263. Implementation of smart
   charging, the system cost decreases to \$36 per vehicle per year,
   resulting in substantial savings of \$227 per vehicle per year.
   Controlled charging methods also effectively reduce system costs by 50\%
   and decrease peak demand. An EV fleet has the potential for cost savings
   in the power system, amounting to \$200-\$300 per year per vehicle. The
   aim of the review is to address the impact on power quality of the
   distribution grid and study the nature of EV unbalanced loads in order
   to minimize impact on grid efficiently by managing the resources.},

Abstract = {The need for reserve provision in power systems is growing progressively
   due to the increase in wind power penetration level. This paper aimed to
   present a model from the ISO point of view for using demand-side
   resources as flexible resources that are aggregated as a demand-side
   provider (DSP). The DSP consists of demand response aggregator as grid
   backup and energy storage systems plus plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)
   parking lot aggregators as fast reserve. In this regard, a two-stage
   stochastic programming model has been presented for energy and reserve
   determination in the unit commitment problem in the form of mixed
   integer linear programming (MILP). In this study, the incentive-based
   model of the capacity market program has been employed to achieve a
   certain level of demand-side response. Meanwhile, the Weibull
   probability distribution function and truncated Gaussian distribution
   have been applied to generate wind speed scenarios and model the
   uncertainties of PEVs' behavior, respectively. The results obtained in
   this study demonstrate that the simultaneous scheduling of energy
   sources and demand-side aggregators for energy supply as well as reserve
   has led to the reduction of wind energy uncertainty and improved system
   operational conditions. Also, increase in the number of PEVs present in
   the parking lot, in addition to reducing the operation costs, leads to
   increased grid reserve level as well as considerable reduction of wind

Abstract = {Under the envisioned smart grid paradigm, there is an increasing demand
   for a fast, accurate, and efficient power flow solution for distribution
   system operation and control. Various solution techniques have been
   proposed, each with its own unique formulation, solution methodology,
   advantages, and drawbacks. Motivated by challenges associated with the
   integration of renewable distributed energy resources and electric
   vehicles into distribution systems and further by the speed and
   convergence limitations of existing tools, this paper presents a novel
   graph-based power flow solution for smart grid's real-time operation and
   control, named Flow-AugmentationPF algorithm. The proposed method
   formulates a power flow problem as a network-flow problem and solves it
   by using a maximum-flow algorithm, inspired by the push-relabel max-flow
   technique. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested and
   validated using several benchmark networks of different sizes,
   topologies, and parameters and compared against the most commonly used
   solution techniques and commercial software packages, namely PSS/E and
   PSCAD. The proposed formulation is simple, accurate, fast, yet
   computationally efficient, as it is based on matrix-vector
   multiplication, and is also scalable, considering the formulation works
   as a graph-based method, which, inherently, allows for parallel
   computation for added computational speed.

Abstract = {In order to maximize utilitarianism and fairness in allocating energy to
   electric vehicles (EVs) during outages, this study proposes an
   optimization method based on modified division rules. The idea of
   essential energy demand is introduced in this paper to maximize the
   number of EVs that are served during power contingencies. For EVs
   carrying out the time-critical task(s), the essential energy demand is
   defined as the amount of energy required by EVs to accomplish their
   upcoming task(s). For EVs carrying out delay-tolerant tasks, it is
   defined as the amount of energy required by EVs to travel to a nearby
   healthy charging station. To this end, an EV ranking mechanism is
   devised considering the full and essential energy demands along with the
   urgency of EVs. Subsequently, EVs with higher ranks are prioritized
   during energy allocation. The performance of the proposed method is
   compared with four existing division rules, i.e., proportional,
   constrained equal awards, constrained equal losses, and sequential
   priority rules. A utilitarianism index is proposed to analyze the
   performance of these methods and fairness is evaluated using existing
   indices, such as Jain's fairness index and cost of fairness index. The
   proposed method has outperformed existing division rules in both
   utilitarianism and fairness for the essential energy demand. Finally, a
   sensitivity analysis of uncertain parameters such as EV fleet size,
   available/required energy, and weight factors is carried out to analyze
   the performance of the proposed method under various conditions.},

Abstract = {The high penetration of distributed energy resources raises new
   challenges in microgrid operation due to their stochastic and
   intermittent characteristics. This exacerbates the difficulty of
   congestion management of microgrids in comparison with conventional
   power systems. In addition to intermittent generation of renewable
   resources, some other factors such as load forecasting errors and forced
   outage of generating units can lead to real-time congestion (RTC) in a
   microgrid. To implement real-time congestion management (RTCM), some
   approaches can be employed by the microgrid central controller (MGCC)
   including network reconfiguration using remote control switches,
   generation and up-grid power rescheduling and load shedding. In this
   paper, a two-stage programming model is proposed to find the optimal
   solution of RCTM under different temperature conditions. Therefore,
   following an unexpected condition and the occurrence of congestion, at
   the first stage, MGCC implements reconfiguration as the lowest-cost
   approach to mitigate RTC. Soccer league algorithm is employed in first
   stage to find the optimal network topology. Subsequently, based on the
   obtained results from the first stage, a programming model is applied at
   the second stage to completely eliminate the RTC. The proposed model
   minimizes a weighted objective function which includes the generation
   and up-grid rescheduling cost, load shedding cost and congestion
   clearing time. To improve the operational planning in unexpected
   conditions, the allowable congestion clearing time is determined based
   on multi-level thermal rate due to temperature conditions. The numerical
   results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the optimal operation of Energy hub (EH) based upon both
   demand and renewable energy resources (RESs) uncertainties is
   investigated. Here, an innovative scenario-based energy hub energy
   management system (EH-EMS) is proposed for simultaneous cost and
   emission reduction considering the abovementioned uncertainties.
   Moreover, a multi objective hybrid heuristic algorithm, the so-called
   hBES-MOGWO, is introduced for solving the proposed EH-EMS, which is a
   combination of bald eagle search (BES) and multi objective gray wolf
   optimization (MOGWO) algorithms. The proposed EH consists of
   photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), boiler, heat storage (HS),combined
   heat and power (CHP) and multi-carrier energy storage technology such as
   power to gas (PtG) technology, electric vehicles and heat storages.
   Flexible loads are also taken into account for reducing cost and
   emission by participation in demand response programs (DRPs). The
   optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   hBES-MOGWO algorithm. The simulation results illustrated that the total
   cost of EH-EMS can be effectively reduced by installing energy storage
   systems and implementing DRPs. The results emphasize that considering
   uncertainties can lead to increase the operating costs and emission,
   while flexible loads participation in DRPs and PtG can reduce the
   aforementioned ones.
   In this manuscript, an innovative 24 h scenario-based energy hub energy
   management system is proposed for cost and emission reduction in case of
   uncertainties. Also, a multi objective hybrid heuristic algorithm called
   hBES-MOGWO is introduced for solving energy hub energy management system

Title = {Enhancing Smart Microgrid Resilience and Virtual Power Plant
   Profitability Through Hybrid IGWO-PSO Optimization With a Three-Phase
   Bidding Strategy},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {80796-80820},
Abstract = {The increasing energy demand and rising fossil fuel prices are
   accelerating the transition to renewable energy, supported by government
   initiatives due to their environmental and economic advantages. However,
   challenges such as limited capacity and stability constraints hinder the
   widespread adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs). Virtual
   Power Plants (VPPs) enhance market participation by aggregating DERs,
   while electric vehicles (EVs) contribute to environmental sustainability
   by reducing emissions. Additionally, integrating distribution static
   compensators (DSTATCOMs) within VPPs improves microgrid stability and
   reactive power support. This study proposes a two-stage optimization
   approach to enhance network resilience and VPP profitability in a radial
   distribution network (RDN). The first stage focuses on minimizing
   resilience-related costs and energy not supplied (ENS) during natural
   disasters, while the second stage optimizes VPP profit using a
   three-phase bidding strategy, which includes the day-ahead market,
   real-time market, and overall market. A hybrid improved grey wolf
   optimization-particle swarm optimization (IGWO-PSO) algorithm is
   developed to solve this complex optimization problem. To demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach, IGWO-PSO is compared with other
   hybrid optimization algorithms. Validation on a modified IEEE 33-bus RDN
   confirms that the proposed model enhances VPP placement and sizing,
   leading to improved economic, operational, and resilience metrics.
   Furthermore, the model accounts for uncertainties in load demand,
   renewable generation, energy prices, and equipment availability,
   ensuring a robust and adaptable energy management strategy.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a practical optimal planning of solar photovoltaic
   (SPV) and battery storage system (BSS) for electric vehicle (EV) owner
   households with time of use (TOU) electricity pricing. The main aim of
   the optimisation problem is to minimize the Cost of Electricity (COE)
   while satisfying the design constraints over 20-year project lifespan.
   Novel rule-based home energy management systems are created to
   investigate the optimal sizing of two system configurations: (1) SPV-EV,
   and (2) SPV-BSS-EV. The arrival and departure times of the EV's
   availability, as well as its initial state-of-charge are incorporated
   into the energy management system via stochastic functions. Sensitivity
   analyses of the feed in tariff, grid constraint, electricity demand, and
   available rooftop area are provided to investigate the variations of
   cost of electricity and capacities of SPV and BSS. From the study
   results, practical guidelines for grid-connected households, based on
   TOU energy pricing, are provided to select the optimal capacity of SPV
   and BSS to accommodate the existing EV. The optimisation method is
   general and applicable to any household owning EV; however, in this
   study realistic data of solar insolation and temperature as well as
   household electricity demand and electricity prices are implemented for
   South Australia. Uncertainty analysis is investigated based on 10-year
   real and stochastic data to prove the optimal results. It is found that
   the optimal configuration for a typical SA household utilising TOU
   pricing with an EV requires a 10-kW SPV with a 10-kWh capacity of BSS.},

Abstract = {Bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) charging enables stored energy to
   reduce peak loads for vehicle to buildings (V2Bs) and the vehicle to
   grid (V2G). However, building owners investing in V2B infrastructure
   while generating revenue from V2G services face challenges in planning
   and coordinating with EV owners due to uncertainties in their schedules
   and profit-sharing expectations. Additionally, misaligned building and
   grid peak times can create conflicts between V2B and V2G goals, which
   may negatively impact the building electricity bill. Unlike previous
   studies that used a contract-free approach for aggregating V2B and V2G,
   resulting in inconsistent participation, this article proposes a novel
   planning and contracting framework that enables building owner to
   determine the optimal contract parameters with EV owners. These
   parameters include minimum participation time in DR events, minimum
   arrival state of charge (SoC), and permitted emergency departure hours.
   The framework supports V2B aggregation with on-site distributed energy
   resources (DERs) for DR and V2G services, ensuring transparency and
   fairness through shared profits and performance-based penalties, while
   compensating building electricity bills due to V2G activities. The
   framework is composed of a tri-stage optimization process that uses
   Monte Carlo simulations to generate EV owner profit assessments, select
   optimal EV candidates based on charger availability, estimate contract
   parameters with profit/penalty sharing, and assign contracts between
   power system operators (PSOs), building owners, and EV owners under
   multiple virtual scenarios. Simulation results validate the contract
   parameter assessment and its performance via a 3-day case study with
   real-world datasets that demonstrates net revenue generation of \$ 209
   for each EV owner and \$ 950 for building owners during DR events with a
   return on investment (ROI) of 134.5\% and 130.7\% for the EVs and
   Building owners, respectively.},

Abstract = {The increased number of nonlinear loads in the distribution system has
   caused a significant impact on its power quality in the form of higher
   harmonic distortion. The fast charging station (FCS) is an example of a
   powerful nonlinear load that is currently being widely promoted with the
   aim of supporting the continuous usage of electric vehicles (EV). The
   most common and cheapest method to minimize harmonic impact is through
   the use of a passive filter. This paper presents an optimal sizing and
   placement of a passive filter design based on the numbers of FCS
   installed in the distribution system. The MATLAB/m-file platform is used
   to model the power system harmonic flow, passive filter, and FCS. The
   control strategy used to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD)
   due to the large number of FCS is presented based on the selection of
   optimal location and the size of passive filters that will provide
   minimum THD and apparent power losses to the overall distribution
   system. A Modified Lightning Search Algorithm (MLSA) technique is
   applied with the aim of identifying the optimal solution. The
   Pareto-Fuzzy technique is used to obtain a better solution among
   nondominated solutions. From the result, the optimal placements and
   sizes of passive filter will be able to reduce the maximum THD and also
   the total losses in the distribution system, which is equipped with 17
   FCS units. This study is useful as a guide for grid owners to control
   the impact of large-scale FCS deployment in the distribution system. (C)

Abstract = {This study presents a mathematical model of lithium-ion (Li-ion)
   batteries in the energy management (EM) problem of a microgrid (MG). In
   this study, the authors develop a detailed model of Li-ion batteries
   that considers the degradation cost associated with operation,
   controllable and uncontrollable charging ramps, other limits, and the
   operating characteristics provided by the manufactures. The Li-ion
   battery degradation cost is analysed using different approaches and is
   compared with modelling without this cost, using a quadratic degradation
   cost, and using a piecewise degradation cost. Furthermore, this cost is
   analysed using a linear cost that takes the life expectancy based on the
   number of cycles of the battery into account. To analyse the proposed
   method and other modelling approaches, the authors examine the battery
   model in an EM problem in an MG. This MG, which can be connected to the
   main grid, also uses wind and photovoltaic as generation resources, in
   addition to a backup generator. The EM problem is modelled as a
   deterministic mixed-integer linear (or quadratic) problem; the results
   of eleven different cases are used in the analysis of the proposed
   Li-ion battery model for a 24 h planning horizon.},

Abstract = {The shift towards a decentralized paradigm in power systems in response
   to decarbonization and deregulation efforts necessitates stronger
   coordination between transmission and distribution operators for
   cost-effective operation and planning. However, long-term uncertainties
   in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for
   decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the
   transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently,
   as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated
   integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in
   practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming
   framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution

   Infrastructure investments are co-optimized with non-network
   alternatives with diverse techno-economic characteristics to support
   flexible planning. To manage the increased computational complexities, a
   machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is
   implemented. The case studies firstly highlight the strategic and
   economic advantages of the proposed multi-stage formulation, and then
   demonstrate the significant role and value of smart investment options
   in managing uncertainty. Lastly, the application of the proposed model

   considering lost opportunity cost and energy saving},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {140},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper, a practical approach is presented to long-term expansion
   planning of electric vehicle (EV) parking lots which aims to maximize
   the parking lot operator's profit. The optimal number, location,
   capacity, and time for construction or expansion of EV parking lots have
   also been determined. Moreover, a method based on drivers' travel
   patterns is proposed to estimate the number of EVs referring to each
   area, in which the unscented transformation method (UTM) is used to
   calculate the annual growth rate of EVs. An innovative and real-time
   method for optimal charge and discharge scheduling of EVs is also
   provided, which can calculate the parking lots' demand at different
   times. The most important advantages of this method are its independence
   from iterative-based optimization algorithms and from modeling some
   input parameters such as the initial state of charge (SOC) and the
   arrival time of EVs into the parking lot as uncertain parameters. Also,
   a Lagrange interpolation-based method is proposed to minimize the energy
   consumption required for EVs to reach a parking lot. In addition, in
   order to prevent the reduction of parking lot operator's profit in case
   of non-fulfillment of the obligations of the EV owners, an approach
   based on paying the lost opportunity cost (LOC) is presented. Real
   -world data has been used for numerical studies. The results show that
   based on travel patterns and estimating the number of EVs available in
   each municipal district and using the proposed real-time scheduling
   method, parking lot's demand can be calculated as the main prerequisite
   for parking lots expansion planning. Also, the proposed method for
   parking selection compared to two other methods will save energy by
   26.6\% and 8.33\%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approach
   increases the total parking lot operator's profit by 4.23\%.},

Abstract = {The need for a more flexible usage of power is increasing due to the
   electrification of new sectors in society combined with larger amounts

   Among other cities, Uppsala in Sweden is undergoing an accelerated
   transition of its vehicle fleet from fossil combustion engines to
   electrical vehicles. To meet the requirements of the transforming
   mobility infrastructure, Uppsala municipality has, in collaboration with
   Uppsala University, built a full-scale commercial electrical vehicle
   parking garage equipped with a battery storage and photovoltaic system.
   This paper presents the current hardware topology of the parking garage,
   a neural network for day-ahead predictions of the parking garage's load
   profile, and a simulation model in MATLAB using rule-based peak shaving
   control. The created neural network was trained on data from 2021 and
   its performance was evaluated using data from 2022. The performance of
   the rule-based peak shaving control was evaluated using the predicted
   load demand and photovoltaic data collected for the parking garage. The
   aim of this paper is to test a prediction model and peak shaving
   strategy that could be implemented in practice on-site at the parking
   garage. The created neural network has a linear regression index of
   0.61, which proved to yield a satisfying result when used in the
   rule-based peak shaving control with the parking garage's 60 kW/137 kWh
   battery system. The peak shaving model was able to reduce the highest

Abstract = {A practical optimal sizing model is developed for grid-connected rooftop

   Two system configurations, (1) PV-EV and (2) PV-BES-EV, are investigated

   of the customers. Several sensitivity analyses are adopted based on
   variations in the grid constrains, retail price and feed in tariff.
   Uncertainty analysis is provided based on the variations of insolation,

   second stage involves creating an advanced spatial-temporal EV dispatch
   model to maximize the number of available EVs for discharging, thereby
   improving the MPDN recovery after a rare event. The proposed framework
   also includes an information system to further enhance MPDN resilience
   by effectively organizing data exchange among intelligent transportation
   system and smart charging system, and EV users. In addition, a novel
   bidirectional geographic graph is proposed to optimize travel plans,
   covering a large penetration of EVs and considering variations in
   traffic conditions. The effectiveness is assessed on a modified IEEE
   123-node test feeder with real-world transportation and charging
   infrastructure. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in
   MPDN resilience with smart restoration strategies. The validation and
   sensitivity analyses evidence a significant superiority of the proposed
   framework.
   In the realm of cyber-physical-social systems, existing research lacks a
   comprehensive framework to optimize coordination strategies for electric
   vehicles (EVs) and enhance the resilience of modern power distribution
   networks (MPDNs). To address this gap, a two-stage EV coordination
   framework is proposed: The first stage focuses on proactive EV
   prepositioning to improve the MPDN survivability immediately after a
   rare event, while the second stage involves advanced spatial-temporal EV
   dispatching to maximize the EV availability for discharge and enhance
   the MPDN recovery. The framework incorporates an information system for
   dynamic data exchange, utilizes a novel geographic graph for optimizing
   EV routes, and demonstrates significant improvements in MPDN resilience
   through real-world evaluations on a modified IEEE 123 node test
   feeder.image},

Title = {Electric Vehicle Charging Load Forecasting Method Based on Improved Long
   Short-Term Memory Model with Particle Swarm Optimization},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {With the rapid global proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), their
   integration as a significant load component within power systems
   increasingly influences the stable operation and planning of electrical
   grids. However, the high uncertainty and randomness inherent in EV
   users' charging behaviors render accurate load forecasting a challenging
   task. In this context, the present study proposes a Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO)-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
   forecasting model. By combining the global search capability of the PSO
   algorithm with the advantages of LSTM networks in time-series modeling,
   a PSO-LSTM hybrid framework optimized for seasonal variations is
   developed. The results confirm that the PSO-LSTM model effectively
   captures seasonal load variations, providing a high-precision, adaptive
   solution for dynamic grid scheduling and charging infrastructure
   planning. This model supports the optimization of power resource
   allocation and the enhancement of energy storage efficiency.
   Specifically, during winter, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is 3.896, a
   reduction of 6.57\% compared to the LSTM model and 10.13\% compared to
   the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. During the winter-spring
   transition, the MAE is 3.806, which is 6.03\% lower than that of the
   LSTM model and 12.81\% lower than that of the GRU model. In the spring,
   the MAE is 3.910, showing a 2.71\% improvement over the LSTM model and a
   7.32\% reduction compared to the GRU model.},

Abstract = {Hybrid Energy Storage System has been widely applied in aerospace,
   electric vehicle, and microgrid applications. The advantages are that
   they include complimentary technologies with both high power and energy
   capabilities. HESS have the potential to be useful to the bulk power
   systems, for example to increase the value of energy produced by
   variable generation resource through enabling participation in ancillary
   service markets. Actualizing the benefits of HESSs requires optimizing
   the combined ramping capability of aggregated HESS resources. To provide
   quality ancillary service, source of HESSs locating at multiple sites of
   variable generation resource must be optimally sized and cohesively
   controlled. Optimizing aggregated resources can be formulated as an
   optimization problem. Successfully solving this problem not only
   requires using effective solution methods but also depends on accurately
   and rapidly setting the necessary parameters in the problem formula.
   This article proposes a novel framework with double-layer structure to
   solve the optimization problem of aggregating ramping capability.
   Program developed on the upper layer focuses on solving the optimization
   of aggregating ramping capability among multiple HESSs and is compatible
   with most existing optimization algorithms. Program on lower layer of
   the framework targets at optimizing the local control of a single HESS
   based on a thorough analytics of HESS operation strategy presented in
   this article. Result of local optimization is also provided to upper
   layer program for updating the parameters in formula of optimization
   problem. Real time hardware-in-the-loop test is conducted to verify the
   performance of the optimization framework developed. The work presented
   is expected to provide guidance for implementing this framework in
   practical operation.},

Title = {An Evolutionary Game Theory-Based Optimal Scheduling Strategy for
   Multiagent Distribution Network Operation Considering Voltage Management},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {50227-50241},
Abstract = {Distribution system operators (DSOs) have difficulty in scheduling
   distributed energy resources owing to the increasing power demand and
   penetration of renewable energy. The goal of this study is to determine
   the charging/discharging of PV energy-integrated energy storage system
   (PV-ESS), EV charging price, and demand response (DR) incentive values
   considering voltage management. To achieve the optimal energy operation
   for a distribution network, this study proposes an evolutionary game
   theory (EGT)-based new scheduling strategy, considering voltage
   management for a multi-agent system (MAS). The EGT, which is a
   decision-making strategy, is used by agents to cooperate and derive the
   best scheduling with their own behavior pattern functions to minimize
   the system operating cost. Photovoltaic-energy storage systems, electric
   vehicles charging power, and loads can perform charging/discharging
   scheduling, electric vehicle charging planning, and demand response
   participation, respectively. Under DSO supervision, a reward that
   stabilizes the voltage profile of the power distribution system is also
   implemented during the cooperation process. The proposed energy
   scheduling strategy combines an EGT-based decision-making with particle
   swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the optimization problem and determine
   the payoff function through self-evolutionary improvement. The
   effectiveness of the EGT-PSO has been analyzed for an IEEE 33-bus
   distribution system, and the results demonstrate that the proposed
   scheduling strategy not only achieves the most economical decision among
   agents but also manages the voltage profile.},

Title = {Holistic approach for microgrid planning for e-mobility infrastructure
   under consideration of long-term uncertainty},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Integrating renewable energy sources in sectors such as electricity,
   heat, and transportation has to be planned economically,
   technologically, and emission-efficient to address global environmental
   issues. Microgrids appear to be the solution for large-scale renewable
   energy integration in these sectors. The microgrid components must be
   optimally planned and operated to prevent high costs, technical issues,
   and emissions. Existing approaches for optimal microgrid planning and
   operation in the literature do not include a solution for e-mobility
   infrastructure development. Consequently, the authors provide a compact
   new methodology that considers the placement and the stochastic
   evolution of e-mobility infrastructure. In this new methodology, a
   retropolation approach to forecast the rise in the number of electric
   vehicles, a monte-carlo simulation for electric vehicle (EV) charging
   behaviors, a method for the definition of electric vehicle charging
   station (EVCS) numbers based on occupancy time, and public EVCS
   placement based on monte-carlo simulation have been developed. A
   deterministic optimization strategy for the planning and operation of
   microgrids is created using the abovementioned methodologies, which
   additionally consider technical power system issues. As the future
   development of e-mobility infrastructure has high associated
   uncertainties, a new stochastic method referred to as the information
   gap decision method (IGDM) is proposed. This method provides a
   risk-averse strategy for microgrid planning and operation by including
   long-term uncertainty related to e-mobility. Finally, the deterministic
   and stochastic methodologies are combined in a novel holistic approach
   for microgrid design and operation in terms of cost, emission, and
   robustness.The proposed method has been tested in a new settlement area
   in Magdeburg, Germany, under three different EV development scenarios
   (negative, trend, and positive). EVs are expected to reach 31 percent of
   the total number of cars in the investigated settlement area. Due to
   this, three public electric vehicle charging stations will be required
   in the 2031 trend scenario. Thus, the investigated settlement area
   requires a total cost of 127,029 =C. In association with possible
   uncertainties, the cost of the microgrid must be raised by 80 percent to
   gain complete robustness against long-term risks in the development of
   EVCS.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Location Determination of Electric Vehicles Parking Lot With

   Optimizer},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {55408-55427},
Abstract = {In this manuscript proposes a hybrid approach for locating and sizing
   Electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) optimally and managing the
   vehicle charging process. The proposed hybrid approach is to work in
   conjunction with Mexican Axolotl optimization (MAO) and Wild Horse
   Optimizer (WHO) hence it is named as MAOWHO approach. The major purposes
   of the proposed approach are to site and size of the electric vehicle
   parking lot (EVPL) and to improve the benefit of EVPL for the
   participation of the reserve market. In addition, power loss and voltage
   fluctuations occur due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy
   sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EV) demand load, which is reduced
   by the proposed approach. To optimally determine the size of the parking
   lot, the MAOWHO approach is adopted. The integration of the EV and PV
   systems, especially in parking lots, enhances the reliability and
   flexibility of the electrical system at critical moments. Multiple
   objective optimization problems are calculated to achieve objective
   variables to reduce power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and
   supply costs, and EV costs. The location and capacity of the RES and EV
   charging stations in this optimization problem are objective variables.
   The MAOWHO approach enhances Solar Powered Electric Vehicle Parking Lot
   (EVSPL) participation in various energy and ancillary service markets
   that includes the effects of capacity payments. Besides, the
   implementation of MAOWHO approach is done by the MATLAB/Simulink
   platform and the performance of the MAOWHO approach is compared to the
   existing approaches. From the simulation outcome, it concludes that the
   proposed approach based performance provides a profit of 880
   eurocompared to other approaches like SMO, CGO, SBLA.},

Title = {Reliability-constrained transmission expansion planning based on
   simultaneous forecasting method of loads and renewable generations},
Journal = {ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {107},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1141-1161},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Due to increased energy consumption in upcoming years, the power system
   needs to be expanded to meet suitable technical conditions. The primary
   requirement is to gain accurate information about consumption growth in
   the planning horizon, which can be obtained via forecast studies. Since
   renewable sources can grow beside the demand, the accurate prediction
   should consider simultaneous changes in supply and demand in the future.
   In this paper, a reliability-constrained transmission expansion planning
   (RCTEP) is proposed. It simultaneously is based on the load forecasting
   and renewable sources production, named the net power demand forecasting
   technique (NPDFT). NPDFT consists of a time series-based logistic
   method, which forecasts loads at planning years. RES generation
   forecasting forecasts the following year's generation by an estimated
   coefficient. RCTEP minimizes the summation of the planning, operation,
   and reliability cost so that it is limited to the AC optimal power flow
   equations, planning constraints, and reliability limitations for N - 1
   contingency. Then, the stochastic programming based on the Monte Carlo
   Simulation and the simultaneous backward approach models the
   uncertainties of the load, RES power, and availability of network
   equipment. This problem is solved by the hybrid algorithm of grey wolf
   optimization and training and learning optimization algorithm to achieve
   the securable optimal solution with a low standard deviation. Generally,
   this paper contributes to predicting the net power demand, simultaneous
   modeling of operation, reliability, and economic indices, besides using
   hybrid algorithms to solve the defined problem. Finally, this strategy
   is implemented on the 3-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus transmission networks
   in MATLAB software. The numerical results confirm the capabilities of
   the proposed method in improving network operation and reliability
   indices. Higher reliability can be found for the network by defining a
   desirable penalty price. Also, operation indices, such as voltage
   profile and power loss, increase more than 10\% under these conditions.},

Title = {Optimal Allocation of Fast Charging Stations on Real Power Transmission
   Network with Penetration of Renewable Energy Plant},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Because of their stochastic nature, the high penetration of electric
   vehicles (EVs) places demands on the power system that may strain
   network reliability. Along with increasing network voltage deviations,
   this can also lower the quality of the power provided. By placing EV
   fast charging stations (FCSs) in strategic grid locations, this issue
   can be resolved. Thus, this work suggests a new methodology
   incorporating an effective and straightforward Red-Tailed Hawk Algorithm
   (RTH) to identify the optimal locations and capacities for FCSs in a
   real Aljouf Transmission Network located in northern Saudi Arabia. Using
   a fitness function, this work's objective is to minimize voltage
   violations over a 24 h period. The merits of the suggested RTH are its
   high convergence rate and ability to eschew local solutions. The results
   obtained via the suggested RTH are contrasted with those of other
   approaches such as the use of a Kepler optimization algorithm (KOA),
   gold rush optimizer (GRO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and spider wasp
   optimizer (SWO). Annual substation demand, solar irradiance, and
   photovoltaic (PV) temperature datasets are utilized in this study to
   describe the demand as well as the generation profiles in the proposed
   real network. A principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce
   the complexity of each dataset and to prepare them for the k-means
   algorithm. Then, k-means clustering is used to partition each dataset
   into k distinct clusters evaluated using internal and external validity
   indices. The values of these indices are weighted to select the best
   number of clusters. Moreover, a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is applied
   to probabilistically determine the daily profile of each data set.
   According to the obtained results, the proposed RTH outperformed the
   others, achieving the lowest fitness value of 0.134346 pu, while the GRO
   came in second place with a voltage deviation of 0.135646 pu.
   Conversely, the KOA was the worst method, achieving a fitness value of
   0.148358 pu. The outcomes attained validate the suggested approach's
   competency in integrating FCSs into a real transmission grid by
   selecting their best locations and sizes.},

   Large-Building Microgrids},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present an optimization planning method for enhancing
   power quality in integrated energy systems in large-building microgrids
   by adjusting the sizing and deployment of hybrid energy storage systems.
   These integrated energy systems incorporate wind and solar power,
   natural gas supply, and interactions with electric vehicles and the main
   power grid. In the optimization planning method developed, the
   objectives of cost-effective and low-carbon operation, the lifecycle
   cost of hybrid energy storage, power quality improvements, and renewable
   energy utilization are targeted and coordinated by using utility fusion
   theory. Our planning method addresses multiple energy forms-cooling,
   heating, electricity, natural gas, and renewable energies-which are
   integrated through a combined cooling, heating, and power system and a
   natural gas turbine. The hybrid energy storage system incorporates
   batteries and compressed-air energy storage systems to handle fast and
   slow variations in power demand, respectively. A sensitivity matrix
   between the output power of the energy sources and the voltage is
   modeled by using the power flow method in DistFlow, reflecting the
   improvements in power quality and the respective constraints. The method
   proposed is validated by simulating various typical scenarios on the
   modified IEEE 13-node distribution network topology. The novelty of this
   paper lies in its focus on the application of integrated energy systems
   within large buildings and its approach to hybrid energy storage system
   planning in multiple dimensions, including making co-location and
   capacity sizing decisions. Other innovative aspects include the
   coordination of hybrid energy storage combinations, simultaneous siting
   and sizing decisions, lifecycle cost calculations, and optimization for
   power quality enhancement. As part of these design considerations,
   microgrid-related technologies are integrated with cutting-edge nearly
   zero-energy building designs, representing a pioneering attempt within
   this field. Our results indicate that this multi-objective,
   multi-dimensional, utility fusion-based optimization method for hybrid
   energy storage significantly enhances the economic efficiency and
   quality of the operation of integrated energy systems in large-building
   microgrids in building-level energy distribution planning.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of EVs and their mobilization with great
   acceptance in society forced the power system to expand because of the
   increase in demand for power during EV charging and its uncertain
   charging nature. The integration of solar energy has increased to meet
   this increased demand. Hence, due to the inappropriate integration of
   Solar-based Distributed Generations, the system gets unbalanced with
   increased losses, voltage profile imbalance, poor fault tolerance
   capability, and reliability issues. Also, it is impossible to fulfill
   the increased reactive power demand of the Distribution Network by these
   DGs. Therefore, in this work, to address these issues, the appropriate
   planning of hybrid Solar-DG Integrated DSTATCOM in a reconfigured DN
   with Exponential Load Model (Exp(LM)), including EV Charging Station
   load impacts, is presented considering the Sustainable Development
   Goals: Techno-Enviro-Economic challenges. The presented work's
   effectiveness is established on a modernized practical 33-bus DN using
   APSO, GWO-PSO, TLBO, and HBA by optimizing the TEE parameters. The
   considered techno parameters of the DN are Active Power Loss, Reactive
   Power Loss, Voltage Deviation, Level of Line Fault Current, and Service
   Reliability, which makes up the Multiple-Objective Fitness Problem.
   Similarly, the economic and enviro performance parameters are the Cost
   for Slack Bus Generation, Cost for Fixed Capital Recovery, Cost for
   Energy Lost, Cost for Energy Not Supplied, Total Cost, Cost for Solar-DG
   Integrated DSTATCOM, Saving Cost, Pay Back Period, and Environmental
   Particle Emission. By addressing the TEE challenges, the three key
   emerging SDGs have been addressed which are SDG 7, SDG 12, and SDG 15.
   Hence, the planning of SID in a reconfigured DN with Exp(LM),
   considering EVCS load impacts by addressing the SDG concerns in a
   multi-objective environment, is the presented work's unique contribution
   and novelty.},

Title = {Security-Constrained generation and transmission expansion planning
   based on optimal bidding in the energy and reserve markets},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The increasing growth of power system demand causes different challenges
   for the network operation and security situation. Therefore, this paper
   presents security-constrained generation and transmission expansion
   planning (SCGTEP) according to a strategic bidding model in the energy
   and reserve markets. This method includes a bi-level optimization
   problem, where its upper level refers to the transmission company
   (TransCo) and generation company (GenCo) economic model. This level
   minimizes the difference between TransCos and GenCos costs and revenues
   in the energy and reserve markets subjected to allowed investment budget
   for transmission lines and generation units. Moreover, the lower level
   problem considers the energy and reserve market-clearing model based on
   AC security-constrained optimal power flow. In other words, this problem
   minimizes the summation of network operation and security costs limited
   to the linearized AC optimal power flow equations, reserve formulation
   of generation units, load shedding model due to N - 1 contingency, and
   linearized voltage stability constraints. In the next step, the
   single-level SCGTEP is achieved using the KarushKuhn-Tucker, and it is
   solved by the Benders decomposition approach to obtain an optimal
   solution at a low calculation time. This strategy includes the
   uncertainties of load, renewable generation power, and the availability
   of the network equipment, hence, scenario-based stochastic programming
   is used in this paper to model uncertain parameters. The proposed SCGTEP
   is tested on the 6-bus and 118-bus IEEE networks in the GAMS software.
   According to the obtained numerical results, the proposed strategy can
   be simultaneously improved operation and security indices about 34.5\%
   and 100\%, respectively, compared to the power flow analysis based on
   the optimal location of generation units and transmission lines. Also,
   GenCos and TransCos can clear their investment cost after 5 years with
   participation in the electricity market.},

Abstract = {In low-voltage power distribution systems with high penetration of
   photovoltaics (PVs) generation and electric vehicles (EVs), the
   over-voltage problem arises at times because of large PV generation, and
   under-voltage problem also arises sometimes because of simultaneous
   charging of massive EVs. Over- and under-voltage problems lead to more
   difficulties in achieving voltage regulation. Demand response (DR) is
   expected to be promising and cost-effective in promoting smart grids,
   and hence, the utilisation of flexible resources (FRs) through DR can be
   helpful for distribution system voltage regulation. This study
   introduces a hierarchical control structure of a community energy
   management system (CEMS) and multiple sub-CEMSs to apply an FR-based
   two-stage voltage regulation technique. In the first stage, i.e. the
   day-ahead scheduling stage, each sub-CEMS optimises the FRs' schedules
   for minimising customers' electricity cost and network voltage violation
   times. In the second stage, i.e. the real-time operation stage, the
   voltage sensitivity-based FRs' shifting method is proposed to eliminate
   network voltage violations caused by errors of estimated day-ahead data.
   The proposed models and methods are verified based on a realistic
   distribution system in Japan, where voltage violations, customer
   electricity cost and a number of on-load tap changer tap operations are
   proved to be reduced.},

Title = {Implementation of a Decision-Making Approach for a Hydrogen-Based
   Multi-Energy System Considering EVs and FCEVs Availability},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {114705-114721},
Abstract = {Innovative green vehicle concepts have become increasingly prevailing in
   consumer purchasing habits as technology evolves. The global transition
   towards sustainable transportation indicates an increase in
   new-generation vehicles, including both fuel-cell electric vehicles
   (FCEVs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that will take on roads in
   the future. This change requires new-generation stations to support
   electrification. This study introduced a prominent multi-energy system
   concept with a hydrogen refueling station. The proposed multi-energy
   system (MES) consists of green hydrogen production, a hydrogen refueling
   station for FCEVs, hydrogen injection into natural gas (NG), and a
   charging station for PEVs. An on-site renewable system projected at the
   station and a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer (PEM) to produce
   hydrogen for two significant consumers support MES. In addition, the MES
   offers the ability to conduct two-way trade with the grid if renewable
   energy systems are insufficient. This study develops a comprehensive
   multi-energy system with an economically optimized energy management
   model using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. The
   determinative datasets of vehicles are generated in a Python environment
   using Gauss distribution. The fleet of FCEVs and PEVs are currently
   available on the market. The study includes fleets of the most common
   models from well-known brands. The results indicate that profits
   increase when the storage capacity of the hydrogen tank is higher and
   natural gas injections are limitless. Optimization results for all cases
   tend to choose higher-priced natural gas injections over hydrogen
   refueling because of the difference in costs of refueling and injection
   expenses. The analyses reveal the highest hydrogen sales to the natural
   gas (NG) grid by consuming 2214.31 kg, generating a revenue of \$ 6966,
   and in contrast, the lowest hydrogen sales to the natural gas grid at
   1045.38 kg, resulting in a revenue of \$ 3286. Regarding electricity,
   the highest sales represent revenue of \$ 7701 and \$ 2375 for
   distribution system consumption and electric vehicles (EV),
   respectively. Conversely, Cases 1 and 2 have achieved sales to EV of \$
   2286 and \$ 2349, respectively, but do not have any sales to
   distribution system consumption regarding the constraints. Overall, the
   optimization results show that the solution is optimal for a
   multi-energy system operator to achieve higher profits and that all
   end-user parties are satisfied.},

Title = {EV Hybrid Battery With Integrated Multilevel Neutral-Point-Clamped
   Interfacing and Lossless Intermodule State-of-Charge Balancing},
Journal = {IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {130-144},
Abstract = {The battery is at the heart of the electric vehicle and determines many
   of its key performance features. Therefore, an optimized design of the
   battery is critical. On the one hand, the design of batteries based on a
   single battery cell leads in many cases to oversized batteries in terms
   of energy or power, due to the diversity of requirements of the
   different electric vehicles. On the other hand, the use of a custom cell
   for each vehicle, optimized for its particular requirements, is not
   economically viable. Instead, hybrid batteries, combining only two
   battery cell chemistries, with distinct particular strengths, such as
   high specific energy or high specific power, offer an opportunity to
   cover a wide range of vehicle battery specifications while avoiding
   oversizing and dispersion in the cells to be employed. This work
   introduces a novel hybrid battery configuration, where the interfacing
   between the two sets of cells is accomplished through a bidirectional
   multilevel neutral-point-clamped dc-dc converter. The novel topology is
   presented, and a suitable power converter modulation and control
   strategy is developed. The feasibility and benefits of such
   configuration are demonstrated and illustrated. Particularly, the
   proposed battery system allows the balancing of the State-of-Charge
   (SoC) of the battery modules within both the sets of battery banks,
   which is achieved without introducing additional power losses. The SoC
   balancing is simply accomplished through the regulation of the power to
   be extracted/delivered from/to each battery module by the power
   converter during regular battery discharging and charging operations.
   The converter features enough regulation margin to correct substantial
   SoC imbalances. Overall, the proposed approach enables a modular and
   scalable design of the energy storage system for a wide range of
   electric vehicles, from only two different standard battery modules and
   a standard power semiconductor device, while optimizing the battery size
   for any given battery power and energy specification. Simulation and
   experimental results are provided in the case of a three-level internal
   battery interfacing to verify the good performance of the proposed novel
   hybrid battery configuration, modulation, and control.},

Abstract = {The variability of renewable energy within microgrids (MGs) necessitates
   the smoothing of power fluctuations through the effective scheduling of
   internal power equipment. Otherwise, significant power variations on the
   tie-line connecting the MG to the main power grid could occur. This
   study introduces an innovative scheduling strategy that utilizes a
   data-driven approach, employing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm
   to achieve this smoothing effect. The strategy prioritizes the
   scheduling of MG's internal power devices, taking into account the
   stochastic charging patterns of electric vehicles. The scheduling
   optimization model is initially described as a Markov decision process
   with the goal of minimizing power fluctuations on the interconnection
   lines and operational costs of the MG. Subsequently, after preprocessing
   the historical operational data of the MG, an enhanced scheduling
   strategy is developed through a neural network learning process.
   Finally, the results from four scheduling scenarios demonstrate the
   significant impact of the proposed strategy. Comparisons of reward
   curves before and after data preprocessing underscore its importance. In
   contrast to optimization results from deep deterministic policy
   gradient, soft actor-critic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms,
   the superiority of the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with
   the addition of a priority experience replay mechanism is highlighted.
   This study proposes a novel scheduling strategy utilizing a data-driven
   approach to smooth power fluctuations, specifically employing a deep
   reinforcement learning algorithm. The strategy involves scheduling MG's
   internal power devices using a priority-level approach while considering
   the random charging patterns of private electric vehicles. The
   scheduling optimization models are first formulated as a Markov decision
   process, with the objective of minimizing tie-line power fluctuation and
   MG operation costs. image},

Abstract = {Economic operation and reliable supply-demand balance are problems of
   paramount importance in power grids with a massive share of intermittent
   renewable energy sources (RESs) of great interest. This paper sought an
   optimal coordinated generation scheduling for day-ahead power system
   operation considering RESs and energy storage units. Renewable power
   generation, particularly, wind and photovoltaic are uncontrollable,
   whereas can be predicted using forecasting models. Within the proposed
   framework, a hyperparameter-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM)
   regression model is employed to forecast the day-ahead weather from the
   historical time-series weather data. Eventually, an empirical formula is
   used to estimate the power conversion from the day-ahead weather
   forecasts for a selected PV module and wind turbine. The objective of
   the scheduling framework is to keep a delicate supply-demand balance at
   the lowest possible cost of generation while maintaining the prevailing
   generation and system constraints. A variance measure uncertainty
   handling-based grey wolf optimizer (GWO) technique is used to find the
   optimal day-ahead generation schedules and dispatches under RESs
   forecast uncertainty. The proposed generation scheduling framework is
   examined on the IEEE 6 and 30-bus systems. In the studied scenarios, the
   coordinated operation of generators can decrease the total day-ahead
   operating cost for the modified IEEE 6-bus system by 2.57\% compared to
   supplying electricity generation with conventional generators alone.
   Likewise, the total operating cost from the coordinated operation of all
   generation portfolios was reduced by 6.93\% from the operating cost of
   generation during base case simulation (supply only from dispatchable
   thermal units) on the modified IEEE 30-bus system. Moreover, the case
   studies show that coordinated generation scheduling can mitigate the
   RESs power variability problem, provide secure supply-demand operation,
   and minimize the operating cost of electricity generation.},

Abstract = {Uncertainty in power system analysis is increasing, mainly due to
   decentralized generation and the related spatial distribution of power
   plants, as well as the inherent volatility of renewable energy sources.
   In Austria, this development is reflected in a high number of
   photovoltaic grid connection applications in recent years. On the
   consumption side, there are changes in grid loads due to the increasing
   electrification of society, which is reflected, for example, in a rising
   number of electric vehicles. These aspects of uncertainty in generation
   and consumption must be considered in the planning process of
   distribution grids. A proper way to include uncertainty in the hosting
   capacity analysis of power grids are probabilistic load flow calculation
   methods. This paper provides an introductory overview of probabilistic
   load flow analysis, available calculation methods, required input
   parameters and the interpretation of results. This paper focuses on
   photovoltaics, so a correlation analysis of historical power generation
   measurements of spatially distributed photovoltaic power plants in
   Austria is presented. Furthermore, an insight into the development of
   Austrian photovoltaic grid connection applications from recent years is
   given.

Title = {Operational scheduling of a smart distribution system considering

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {159-178},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, a new bi-level framework is presented for operational
   scheduling of a smart distribution company (SDISCO) with electric
   vehicle (EV) parking lot (PL) and renewable energy sources (RES), i.e.,
   wind and photovoltaic (PV) units. In the proposed bi-level model,
   maximization of the profit of SDISCO is obtained in the upper-level
   (leader) problem by minimizing the cost of power purchased from the
   wholesale market due to the EV PL unique capability, i.e., PL-to-grid.
   The lower-level (follower) problem aims to maximize the profit of the PL
   owner. This model is converted to a non-linear single-level problem by
   using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Fortuny-Amat and McCarl
   method is used for linearization based on auxiliary binary variables and
   sufficiently large constants. Moreover, uncertainties such as duration
   of the presence of EVs in PL, the initial state of the charge (SOC) of
   EVs and output power generation of wind and PV units are simultaneously
   considered through a set of scenarios. The SDISCO's profit is
   investigated in four modes: (1) without RES and with the controlled
   charging of EVs; (2) without RES and with smart charging/discharging of
   EVs; (3) with RES and with the controlled charging of EVs; (4) with RES
   and with smart charging/discharging of EVs. In all these modes, a
   price-based demand response (DR) program is considered, as well as
   incentive-based DR, and combined price-based DR and incentive-based DR.
   The presented model is tested on the IEEE 15-bus distribution system
   over a 24-h period. The results show that SDISCO gains more profit by
   using a suitable charging/discharging schedule and employing a critical
   peak pricing (CPP) program. Furthermore, by comparing this bi-level
   model with the centralized model, the effectiveness of the bi-level
   model is demonstrated. Also, sensitivity analyses on the number of EVs,
   size of RES and the percentage of customer participation in the DR
   program are evaluated on the optimal operation of the SDISCO.},

Title = {Neuro-Fuzzy and Networks-Based Data Driven Model for Multi-Charging
   Scenarios of Plug-in-Electric Vehicles},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {87150-87165},
Abstract = {In recent times, significant progress has been achieved in the domain of
   intelligent and eco-friendly transportation. Electric mobility emerges
   as a viable and effective solution, offering cost-efficient means of
   transportation. However, the rise in fuel expenses, climate change, and
   unregulated charging of electric vehicles (EVs) have necessitated a
   transformative shift in the operation of smart grids. The exponential
   rise in EV charging requirements has the potential to adversely affect
   power grids, resulting in peak demand, grid overload, energy hub
   emissions, and possible infrastructure overburden. This study presents a
   predictive cost model that utilizes a hybrid search and rescue (SAR) and
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), denoted as the SAR-ANFIS
   approach. The model is designed to effectively model complex dynamic
   energy emission dispatch scenarios that are integrated with transient
   charging loads. These scenarios include peak, off-peak, electric power
   research institute (EPRI), and stochastic scenarios. The proposed
   methodology aims to minimize the cost of charging scenarios while
   providing policymakers with a tool to create financial budgets for
   forthcoming electric vehicle loads. This is achieved through the use of
   a fuzzy model that has the ability to predict costs. The ANFIS exhibits
   robust predictive capabilities owing to its aptitude for acquiring and
   representing intricate non-linear associations between input and output
   variables. The incorporation of ANFIS into a SAR algorithm results in
   improved predictive capacity through the optimization of the learning
   process, enhancement of model accuracy, and facilitation of efficient
   parameter tuning. The integration of ANFIS and SAR algorithms enhances
   predictive accuracy and robustness by leveraging the former's adaptive
   and learning capabilities and the latter's global search and
   optimization capabilities. The model considers various charging
   strategies and dispatch constraints within an energy hub. The attainment
   of the 24-hour pricing scheme is achieved by solving a minimum-cost
   optimization problem, which serves as the initial training data for the
   development of the proposed model using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy
   approach. The proposed approach effectively coordinates the various
   charging behaviours of electric vehicles, including those identified by
   the EPRI, as well as stochastic, peak, and off-peak charging, at the
   system level. The proposed methodology offers several advantages,
   including the facilitation of coordination among various charging
   scenarios for EVs and the creation of a cost prediction model that can
   assist policymakers in devising budgetary plans for future EV loads. One
   of the benefits of this technology is its capacity for autonomy, which
   enables vehicle owners to charge their electric vehicles in a
   cost-effective manner, regardless of the specific scenario they find
   themselves in. Furthermore, the suggested plan has the potential to
   mitigate the release of greenhouse gases from the power generation
   sector, thereby facilitating the establishment of a viable charging
   network that is environmentally sustainable. The present study examines
   the efficacy of the SAR-ANFIS approach and model on a standardized test
   system across a range of load profiles.},

Title = {Evaluation of EV penetration level limit in distribution system applying
   charging and scheduling strategies},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Traveling by electric vehicles (EVs) instead of conventional fuel cars
   is strongly supported by a lot of governments for the sustainable
   development of urban transportation. However, EVs increase the load in
   the distribution system which impacts the voltage stability in the
   distribution network. In this paper, a method for evaluation the largest
   EV number to be accommodated in the distribution system is proposed.
   First of all, a Monte Carlo charging model for electric vehicles is
   established. Then the EV charging schedule is determined with the TOU
   electricity price and the dispatch method to suppress the maximum peak
   load is presented. Ultimately, Considering the temporal and spatial
   features of EV charging, the maximum vehicle access capacity of the
   distribution network is calculated by the continuous power flow method.
   The developed method was tested in the PG\&E 69-bus distribution system,
   and the results show that the EV penetration level evaluation method
   proposed is an efficient tool for the distribution system planning, as
   well as the voltage stability analysis with the fast increasing EVs in
   the distribution system. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The transition from conventional fossil-fuel vehicles to electric
   vehicles (EVs) is critical for mitigating environmental pollution. The
   placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) significantly
   impacts the utility operator and electrical network. Inappropriately
   placed EVCS lead to challenges such as increased load, unbalanced
   generation, power losses, and reduced voltage stability. Incorporating
   distributed generation (DG) helps mitigate these issues by maximizing EV
   usage. This study focuses on optimizing EVCS and DG placement in radial
   distribution networks. The methodology employs a backward and forward
   sweep method for load flow analysis and utilizes the particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine optimal EVCS and DG locations
   and sizes. This approach, validated on the IEEE-33 bus system,
   outperforms existing methods. Results indicate a 2.5 times greater power
   loss reduction compared to simulated annealing (SA), 1.6 times better
   than artificial bee colony, and parity with genetic algorithm (GA).
   Overall, the PSO algorithm demonstrates superior optimization
   effectiveness and computational efficiency, showcasing 1-2.5 times
   better performance than other methodologies. Employing this approach
   yields significantly improved results, making it a promising technique
   for optimizing EVCS and DG placement in distribution networks.
   Electric vehicles (EVs) are incorporated into the transport sector to
   reduce the harmful effects of fossil fuel vehicles. Here, the optimal
   placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and distributed
   energy sources (DGs) on the radial distribution network is performed
   using the particle swarm optimization method. For the load flow
   analysis, the backward and forward sweep method is used.image},

Title = {Distribution expansion planning in the presence of plug-in electric
   vehicle: A bilevel optimization approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {121},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Popularization of plug-in electric vehicles has changed the traditional
   strategies for distribution expansion planning problem. Therefore,
   considering the high penetration of electric vehicles, it is necessary
   to propose new models and strategies for this problem. The present study
   proposes a new multi-stage model to expand the distribution network
   based on the bilevel optimization taking the plug-in electric vehicles
   into account. In the upper level, whose objective function is the total
   annualized investment cost plus annual expected production and
   maintenance cost, the investment and utilization decision variables are
   identified. In comparison, in the lower problem, whose objective
   function is the cost of purchased energy from the main grid, the daily
   optimal scheduling is determined. By using primal-dual formulation, this
   bilevel optimization is recast as a mixed-integer linear programming
   problem, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. A 24-node
   distribution network is used to show the efficiency, tractability, and
   economic advantages of the proposed methodology. The results indicate
   that the DEP with the smart charging strategy will lead to less
   investment cost compared with the case in which the dumb charging
   strategy is utilized. In addition, the results show that the optimal
   solution of the proposed bilevel model is superior to the optimal
   solution of the model in which the smart charging problem is solved in a
   separate optimization problem.},

Title = {Dynamic Charging Optimization Algorithm for Electric Vehicles to
   Mitigate Grid Power Peaks},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) presents both
   opportunities and challenges for the electrical grid. While EVs offer a
   promising avenue for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on
   fossil fuels, their uncoordinated charging behavior can strain grid
   infrastructure, thus creating new challenges for grid operators and EV
   owners equally. The uncoordinated nature of electric vehicle charging
   may lead to the emergence of new peak loads. Grid operators typically
   plan for peak demand periods and deploy resources accordingly to ensure
   grid stability. Uncoordinated EV charging can introduce unpredictability
   and variability into peak load patterns, making it more challenging for
   operators to manage peak loads effectively. This paper examines the
   implications of uncoordinated EV charging on the electric grid to
   address this challenge and proposes a novel dynamic optimization
   algorithm tailored to manage EV charging schedules efficiently,
   mitigating grid power peaks while ensuring user satisfaction and vehicle
   charging requirements. The proposed ``Proof of Need{''} (PoN) charging
   algorithm aims to schedule the charging of EVs based on collected data
   such as the state of charge (SoC) of the EV's battery, the charger
   power, the number of connected vehicles per household, the end-user's
   preferences, and the local distribution substation's capacity. The PoN
   algorithm calculates a priority index for each EV and coordinates the
   charging of all connected EVs at all times in a way that does not exceed
   the maximum allocated power capacity. The algorithm was tested under
   different scenarios, and the results offer a comparison of the charging
   power demand between an uncoordinated EV charging baseline scenario and
   the proposed coordinated charging model, proving the efficiency of our
   proposed algorithm, thus reducing the charging demand by 40.8\% with no
   impact on the overall total charging time.},

Abstract = {In the future, electric vehicles (EVs) are anticipated to dominate the
   urban transportation sector. To lessen the operational risk of existing
   distribution networks due to massive deployment of EVs, optimal planning
   and operation are vital as EVs elevate new charging demand. This article
   conducts a comprehensive study on the feasibility of integrating EVs
   into the existing distribution system, considering both slow and fast
   charging schemes. The problem is formulated as an objective function
   that minimizes the total price of charging incurred by the charging
   stations and the peak-to-average ratio. To diminish the negative impact
   of EVs on the node voltage in the distribution system, EVs are also
   modeled as a reactive power compensating device. Simulations are
   conducted on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and an in-depth study
   is presented on the maximum feasible EV penetration to the existing
   system without augmentation. The problem is solved using a novel
   metaheuristic optimization called the water cycle algorithm. The
   proposed charging/discharging strategy works well and results in the
   housing of higher penetration of EVs in the distribution network along
   with a reduction in the charging price. Moreover, with the proposed

Abstract = {In this paper, the effect of plug-in electric vehicles is studied on the
   smart distribution system with a standard IEEE 30-bus network. At first,
   harmonic power flow analysis is performed by Newton-Raphson method and
   by considering distorted substation voltage. Afterward, proper sizes of
   capacitors is selected by cuckoo optimization algorithm to reduce the
   power losses and cost and by imposing acceptable limit for total
   harmonic distortion and RMS voltages. It is proposed that the impact of
   generated current harmonics by electric vehicle battery chargers should
   be factored into overall load control strategies of smart appliances.
   This study is generalized to the different hours of a day by using daily
   load curve, and then optimum time for charging of electric vehicles
   batteries in the parking lots are determined by cuckoo optimization
   algorithm. The results show that injecting harmonic currents of plug-in
   electric vehicles causes a drop in the voltage profile and increases
   power loss. Moreover, charging the vehicle batteries has more impact on
   increasing the power losses rather than the harmonic currents effect.
   Also, the findings showed that the current harmonics has a great
   influence on increasing of THD. Finally, optimum working times of all
   parking lots was obtained for the utilization cost reduction.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, significant efforts have been devoted to
   developing intelligent and sustainable transportation to address
   pollution problems and fuel shortages. Transportation agencies in
   various countries, along with several standardization organizations,
   have proposed different types of energy sources (such as hydrogen,
   biodiesel, electric, and hybrid technologies) as alternatives to fossil
   fuel to achieve a more ecofriendly and sustainable environment. However,
   to achieve this goal, there are significant challenges that still need
   to be addressed. We present a survey on sustainable transportation
   systems that aim to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. We
   describe the architectural components of a future sustainable means of
   transportation, and we review current solutions, projects, and
   standardization efforts related to green transportation with particular
   focus on electric vehicles. We also highlight the main issues that still
   need to be addressed to achieve a green transportation management

Abstract = {The issue of simultaneous planning of electric vehicles and distributed
   generation resources has received more attention from energy researchers
   in recent years. Scattered renewable sources do not have a certain
   amount of production and, according to research, follow possible
   mathematical functions. Renewable energy sources are modeled on wind and
   solar production, both of which are moderately generated per hour. In
   this study, using, the optimal allocation problem of the electric
   vehicles parking lots and the optimal operation scheduling of the
   electric vehicles in a smart distribution network are studied as a novel
   optimization problem. In the proposed problem, the different factors
   including the technical and the economic issues are considered for
   achieving a realistic solution. In terms of technical issues, minimizing
   network losses, and minimizing voltage drop in feeders, as well as
   supplying all network demand are considered. Also, the total cost of the
   charging and discharge at the electric vehicles parking lots, and the
   total cost paid for purchasing power from upstream network are given as
   economic issues in the proposed problem. Moreover, the price-based DRP
   is considered due to the implementation of the demand side management
   program. To obtain the optimal solution, a hybrid metaheuristic
   algorithms (HMA) has been used. The proposed problem is simulated on the
   standard IEEE 69-bus. It is solved by the proposed HMA and is compared
   with another heuristic method. The obtained results confirm the accuracy
   and efficiency of the proposed problem. The obtained results show
   increased to an acceptable level, the voltage profile was improved and
   network losses were reduced. Finally, the results curves and tables show

   Strategy Considering the Safe Operation of Distribution Network},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Against the background of carbon neutrality, the power dispatching
   operation mode has undergone great changes. It not only gradually
   realizes the coordinated control of source-grid-load-storage, but also
   strives to realize the multi-level coordination of the transmission
   network, distribution network and microgrid. Disorderly charging and
   discharging of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) will have a great
   negative impact on the distribution network, but aggregating EVs and
   guiding them to charge and discharge in an orderly manner will play a
   positive role in delaying investment in the distribution network.
   Therefore, it is urgent to adopt an effective scheduling control
   strategy for electric vehicle charging and discharging. First, a variety
   of indexes were set to analyze the influence of EVs access on
   distribution network and the correlation between the indexes. Then, by
   defining the EVs penetration rate and the load simultaneous rate, the
   charging load planning of EVs was calculated. Based on the simultaneous
   load rate, the regional electricity load plan was calculated, and a
   configuration model of distribution capacity suitable for charging loads
   in different regions was constructed. Finally, an optimal dispatch model
   for electric vehicles considering the safety of distribution network was
   proposed and the distribution transformer capacity allocation model was
   used as the optimization target constraint. Compared with most optimized
   dispatch models used to maximize aggregator revenues and reduce
   peak-to-valley differences and load fluctuations in distribution
   networks, this model could effectively reduce unnecessary investment
   while meeting regional distribution transformer needs and maintaining
   distribution network security. Taking the improved IEEE 34-bus systems
   as an example, the simulation analysis was carried out and the
   investment demand of distribution network under the condition of
   disordered and orderly charge and discharge was compared. The results
   show that the proposed optimal scheduling method can effectively reduce
   the load fluctuation of distribution network, keep the voltage offset
   within the allowable voltage deviation range, and can effectively delay
   the investment of distribution network.},

Abstract = {The increasing penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) should
   lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
   Nevertheless, the development of PEVs is limited by the lack of charging

   bi-level model for the optimal allocation of fast charging stations
   (FCSs) and distribution network expansion planning (DNEP). First, a

   is proposed at the lower level to optimize the allocation of FCSs on the
   transportation network. Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) is utilized to
   estimate daily charging load requirements. Then, we propose an economic
   model for DNEP at the upper level, and the chance constrained method is
   employed to relax power flow constraints to address the uncertainties of
   loads. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the proposed

   Assignment},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {34160-34176},
Abstract = {This paper addresses a critical challenge that utility providers face as
   commercial electric vehicle (EV) fleets rapidly expand. Specifically, it
   focuses on optimizing charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty
   electric vehicles while managing constrained grid capacity. Businesses'
   increasing adoption of mid-size to heavy EV fleets has created a
   significant surge in electricity demand, often exceeding the local
   grid's ability to support charging at vehicles' base locations. Supply
   chain constraints that hinder timely infrastructure upgrades exacerbate
   this mismatch between demand and capacity. We present an optimization
   model for EV fleet charging location assignment that tackles this issue.
   Our approach considers multiple commercial fleet operators, each with a
   set of base locations for their vehicles. The model accounts for limited
   charging capacity at these bases and proposes strategically placing
   charging hubs in areas with excess grid capacity. We incorporate a
   flexible incentive framework into our model to encourage the use of
   these hubs and other non-base charging locations. The primary objective
   of this study is to optimize the allocation of charging resources for
   commercial EV fleets and to maintain grid stability in the face of
   rapidly growing demand. Our model integrates fleet operational
   constraints, grid limitations, and incentive structures to provide a
   comprehensive solution that benefits fleet operators and utility
   providers. To validate our approach, we perform a series of
   computational experiments based on realistic data from the city of San
   Antonio, TX, a major urban center in Texas. These simulations
   demonstrate the model's effectiveness in managing peak demand,
   optimizing resource utilization, and providing actionable insights for
   infrastructure planning.},

Abstract = {The establishment of an electric vehicle charging station (EVCS)
   infrastructure plays a vital role in fostering the sustainable expansion
   of the electric vehicle sector. The unplanned placement of EVCS raises
   various technical and economic issues in the distribution network, and
   it can lead to increased energy losses in the distribution system.
   Installing EVCSs and DGs at strategically chosen positions is essential
   to minimize the impact of EV load on the distribution network. To
   address these issues, this work has proposed a whale optimization
   technique (WOT) for optimizing the placement and sizing of EVCS and DG.
   This novel approach of formulating the multi-objective problem of
   allocating electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, along with DGs and
   capacitors simultaneously improves the voltage stability, minimizes
   active and reactive power losses in the radial distribution system, and
   requires execution time. A forward-backward power flow method has been
   carried out for load flow calculations. The efficacy of the proposed
   approach has been applied on the standard IEEE-33 and 69-bus test
   systems and the obtained results have been compared with the other
   latest optimization techniques. The simulation results validate the
   performance and effectiveness of the Whale Optimization Technique, and
   it has been analyzed that the optimized sizes and allocation of EVCSs,
   DGs, and capacitors lead to an extensive reduction in power losses of
   81.33\% and 80\% in the case of active power and 78.46\% and 80.26\% in

   predict the day-ahead charging demand of electric vehicles (EVs)
   considering key factors including the initial and final state-of-charge

   accurate forecast of EVs charging demand enables the proposed model to
   optimally determine the location of common prime urban parking lots
   (PLs) including residential, offices, food centers, shopping malls, and
   public parks. By incorporating both macro- and micro-level parameters,
   the agents used in this framework provide significant benefits to all

   distribution network operators. Furthermore, the path tracing algorithm
   is employed to find the nearest PL for the EVs and the probabilistic
   method is applied to evaluate the uncertainties of driving patterns of
   EV drivers and the weather conditions. The simulation has been carried
   out in an agent-based modeling (ABM) software called NETLOGO with the
   traffic and weather data of the city of Newcastle Upon Tyne, while the
   IEEE 33 bus system is mapped on the traffic map of the city. The
   findings reveal that the total charging demand of EVs is significantly
   higher on a sunny weekday than on a rainy weekday during peak hours,
   with an increase of over 150 kW. Furthermore, on weekdays higher load
   demand could be seen during the nighttime as opposed to weekends where
   the load demand usually increases during the daytime.},

Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) play a major role in the evolution towards
   sustainable transportation. The integration of information and
   communication technology (ICT) into the electric vehicle (EV) charging
   process has witnessed rapid progress. Wireless communication between EVs
   has become commercially viable, supporting vehicle-to-sensor,
   vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-internet regimes. However, EVs still
   have limited market penetration due to charging process constraints such
   as charging time and the availability of charging points. This paper
   considers an asymmetrical nine-phase smart integrated on-board charging
   (OBC) system with a reduced cost, size and weight. All the propulsion
   components are utilized in the charging process. Both zero machine
   average torque production and unity power factor operation at the grid
   side can simultaneously be obtained during the charging process.
   Additionally, no hardware reconfiguration is required to allow the
   transition between propulsion and charging modes for this system
   topology. Furthermore, the proposed integrated on-board charger is
   completely monitored, and the charging rate is controlled through a
   smartphone application via internet of things (IoT) technology, thus
   optimizing the user experience. A 1.5 kW prototype is implemented to
   validate the proposed system by rewinding a three-phase induction motor
   (IM).},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Regardless of whether level 1, level 2, or dc fast charging, several
   methods are under development or available as an aftermarket option for
   Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). While confining the charging behavior
   of EVs to low-load periods is difficult, it leads to significant and
   uncertain load peaks and valleys in the utility power network.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for an electric vehicle
   charger. The proposed charging method involves power supervisory
   characteristics on the basis of the paradigm of a constant-current and a
   constant-voltage (CC-CV) charger so that the external commands from the
   demand-side resource aggregator in the smart grid can be executed. In
   the method, first, a feedback loop is included in the controller to
   formulate the relationship between battery voltage and charging power as
   a quadratic concave downward polynomial. The controlled output power at
   the beginning of constant voltage charging is then set to the maximum
   value of the quadratic polynomial because the charging power requirement
   near this point is closed to the highest. Hence, if the charging power
   is lower than the allowable maximum power, the proposed charger is
   determined to have followed the traditional CC-CV charging steps. On
   contrast, the proposed circuit launches the power control loop when the
   actual charging power is beyond the maximum power limitation of
   aggregator. The proposed charger can keep the power consumption inside
   an allowable range of aggregator. That is the power consumption at the
   EV charging sites becomes directly programmable by their aggregators.
   The proposed method is examined by conducting an interactive test of a
   remote energy management system and the proposed controller. The results
   revealed that the proposed method provide an easy method to dynamically
   control consumption pattern of the EV charging for demand-side power
   management.},

Abstract = {Large-scale development of electric vehicles (EVs) exposes power grids
   and transportation networks with limited capacity to increased fault
   risks. In this paper, a method to prevent fault risks in advance by
   using the flexibility of EV travel to coordinate the operation of
   distribution and transportation networks is proposed. Since EV travel
   decisions are influenced by the charging and travel time costs,
   adjusting charging price and travel time price can help guide behavior
   and enable coordinated operation of power and transportation networks.
   First, risk-based distribution locational marginal prices (RDLMPs) are
   established to restrain the distribution network risks. Second, traffic
   risks are formulated using origin-destination (OD) risk marginal prices
   (ODRMPs) considering the degree of traffic congestion fault risks. Under
   the guidance of the RDLMPs and ODRMPs, EV fleets optimize their travel
   plans to minimize overall costs, including charging and time costs.
   Finally, case studies verify that the proposed method can reduce the
   operational risks of both distribution and transportation networks.},

Abstract = {High energy consumption, rising environmental concerns and depleting
   fossil fuels demand an increase in clean energy production. The enhanced
   resiliency, efficiency and reliability offered by microgrids with
   distributed energy resources (DERs) have shown to be a promising
   alternative to the conventional grid system. Large-sized commercial
   customers like institutional complexes have put significant efforts to
   promote sustainability by establishing renewable energy systems at
   university campuses. This paper proposes the integration of a
   photovoltaic (PV) system, energy storage system (ESS) and electric
   vehicles (EV) at a University campus. An optimal energy management
   system (EMS) is proposed to optimally dispatch the energy from available
   energy resources. The problem is mapped in a Linear optimization problem
   and simulations are carried out in MATLAB. Simulation results showed
   that the proposed EMS ensures the continuous power supply and decreases
   the energy consumption cost by nearly 45\%. The impact of EV as a
   storage tool is also observed. EVs acting as a source of energy reduced
   the energy cost by 45.58\% and as a load by 19.33\%. The impact on the
   cost for continuous power supply in case of a power outage is also
   analyzed.},

Abstract = {The trend toward the deployment of electric vehicle charging stations
   (EVCSs) equipped with on-site distributed energy resources indicates
   potential transactive energy market (TEM) operations among EVCSs.
   However, unlike regular prosumers, EVCS operations are influenced by
   both the power distribution network (PDN) and the urban transportation
   network (UTN). In this article, we propose a three-stage approach for
   solving the hierarchical energy scheduling and trading problem of EVCSs.
   At the first stage, the day-ahead traffic assignment problem (TAP) of
   the transportation system is solved to determine individual EVCSs'
   charging load. At the second stage, EVCSs solve their profit
   maximization problem to determine their energy scheduling and market
   participation decisions. Finally, at the third stage, TEM among EVCSs is
   cleared by the distribution system operator (DSO). With the DSO
   shouldering both grid operator and market operator functions, the DSO
   problem is formulated as an unbalanced three-phase optimal power flow
   (OPF) model integrating a double-sided auction mechanism. To further
   improve the PDN operation, grid features, such as network
   reconfiguration and tap changers, are introduced into the OPF model. The
   effectiveness of the proposed framework is proved through case studies.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {171},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs), the charging
   facilities appear to be overwhelmed, which leads to problems such as
   long queuing time and high charging costs for EVs. In addition, the
   disorderly charging of EVs will also lead to uneven benefits of charging
   stations (CSs) operators and high power loss in the distribution
   network. To solve these problems, we construct a capacity planning model
   for CSs with the objective of minimizing the total cost of EVs, CS
   operators and power grid. By solving this model, the capacity planning
   result of CSs could meet all given constraints even under a disorderly
   charging strategy. However, disorderly charging will lead to the
   unbalanced use of CSs, which may further cause the waste of charging
   resources. Therefore, we propose the fast charging strategy considering
   the utilization equilibrium of the CSs and slow charging strategy
   considering the total charging cost of EVs. By collecting travel plans
   and vehicle status information of EVs in advance, the intelligent
   transportation system (ITS) will centrally arranges the charging
   schedule for EVs and sets the time-sharing charging price for all CSs.
   Finally, compared with the disorderly charging strategy, we verify that
   the proposed fast charging strategies could improve the total income of
   CS operators, reduce power loss and balance the average queuing time of
   each CS and slow charging strategies could flexibly adjust the EVs
   charging cost and CSs charging income through IEEE 33-bus and road net
   63-node coupling system.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Residential Electric Vehicle (EV) charging significantly affects
   distribution network performance, causing load profile distortions, low
   bus voltages, increased line losses, and voltage stability issues. This
   paper addresses these challenges by proposing optimal allocation of wind
   power-based Distributed Generation (DG) resources in a 240- bus power
   distribution network with residential EV charging. As EV charging peaks
   in the evening, wind power- based DGs are more effective than solar-PV
   alternatives. The Driving Training-Based Optimization (DTBO) algorithm,
   with its dual-phase learning structure and dynamic adaptability, is used
   for the optimal DG placement. DTBO balances exploration and exploitation
   effectively, offering a novel, intelligent optimization approach. Its
   performance is validated through benchmark tests and comparisons with
   algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Improved Grey Wolf Optimization
   (IGWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Teaching Learning Based
   Optimization (TLBO). For case studies, wind speed data and turbine
   parameters are sourced from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) and
   manufacturer datasheets, while EV charging demand is modelled using
   National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) 2017 data. Three EV penetration
   levels are analyzed, showing reductions in network active power losses
   and voltage deviation of up to 45.6 \% and 64.7 \%, respectively. This
   validates the effectiveness of the proposed DTBO technique for optimal

   This article reduces the number of photovoltaic outputs and load

   scenario set. Additionally, we propose a bi-level programming model for
   the coordinated DG and EVCSs planning problem. The maximisation of
   annual overall profit for the power supply company is taken as the
   objective function for the upper planning level. Then, each scenario is
   optimised at the lower level by using active management strategies. The
   improved harmonic particle swarm optimisation algorithm is used to solve
   the bi-level model. The validation results for the IEEE-33 node,
   PG\&E-69 node test system and an actual regional 30-node distribution

   related with the behavior of the PEV owners, for instance, the arrival
   and departure times to home, and the state of charge of the PEV when it
   is plugged to the grid. These parameters are modeled by using
   probability density functions, to then generate random numbers and
   perform Monte Carlo simulations. Each Monte Carlo simulation corresponds
   to the calculation of a power-flow in the analyzed network. The proposed
   methodology is tested on the IEEE 33-bus test distribution network, with
   the purpose of quantifying the influence of diversity of PEVs. The
   analysis is performed, specifically, for identify those transformers and
   lines that could be overloaded. Two scenarios of PEV penetration by 2025
   and 2030 were assessed, i.e., considering that 10 and 30 percent of the
   residential customers will have at least one PEV, respectively. Obtained
   results reveal the importance of considering diversity of PEV model to
   conduct in a suitable manner this type of studies. The proposed
   methodology is expected to be useful for network planning expansion and
   to support the design of time of use tariffs.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Most of the existing electric vehicle (EV) charging navigation methods
   do not simultaneously take into account the electric vehicle charging
   destination optimization and path planning. Moreover, they are unable to
   provide online real-time decision-making under a variety of uncertain
   factors. To address these problems, this paper first establishes a
   bilevel stochastic optimization model for EV charging navigation
   considering various uncertainties, and then proposes an EV charging
   navigation method based on the hierarchical enhanced deep Q network
   (HEDQN) to solve the above stochastic optimization model in real-time.
   The proposed HEDQN contains two enhanced deep Q networks, which are
   utilized to optimize the charging destination and charging route path of
   EVs, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is simulated and
   validated in two urban transportation networks. The simulation results
   demonstrate that compared with the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm,
   single-layer deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and traditional
   hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the proposed HEDQN
   algorithm can effectively reduce the total charging cost of electric
   vehicles and realize online realtime charging navigation of electric

Abstract = {This study proposes a novel scheme for dynamic distribution expansion
   planning (DEP) in the presence of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The
   model considers investment, production and maintenance cost and
   identifies the substations and feeders to be built, reinforced or
   replaced. Owing to the increasing penetration of PEVs into the
   distribution network, traditional strategies to expand the network have
   to be updated to cope with the new uncertainties incurred by the PEVs
   integration. In this regard, a two-stage scenario-based strategy is
   presented, in which the uncertainties related to the PEVs are modelled
   via stochastic optimisation using Monte Carlo simulation. In the first
   stage, the binary decision variables (here and now decision variables)
   are determined, whereas in the second stage, the optimal production of
   substations and optimal charging of PEVs (wait and see decision
   variables) are identified in a day-ahead electricity market. Moreover,
   the daily electricity price and load volatilities have also been taken
   into account. The DEP problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear
   programming problem and is solved using the efficient Benders'
   decomposition algorithm. The results of the case study based on a
   24-node distribution system show the feasibility, tractability and

Abstract = {Large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) has adverse effects on
   distribution network operations. Inappropriate installation of EV
   charging stations (EVCS) degrades the distribution network's power
   quality, affecting smooth functioning. This article proposes a novel
   strategy for properly allocating EVCS in a distribution system by
   analyzing the impact of power quality issues, namely harmonics and loss
   of life of the distribution transformer. The analysis is carried out in
   a standard IEEE-33 bus radial distribution system and a real-time
   distribution system in Kerala, India. The impact of power quality issues
   is highlighted by perceiving the effect of slow/moderate and fast
   chargers in the system under study. The results substantiate the potency
   of the reliability index (RI) strategy. The severity level for planning
   the charging station (CS) in numerous buses in the distribution network
   without infrastructural upgrades is determined by employing a modified
   novel EV placement index (EVPI (m) ). The novelty of the index lies in
   the fact that it incorporates all of the operational parameters with a
   specific focus on the power quality issues in the distribution network.
   The severity level of the EVPI (m) maintains the power quality without
   increasing the rating of the components used or any infrastructural
   upgrades. The sensitivity analysis results prove the robustness of the
   modified EVPI-based strategy. Moreover, the proposed strategy is
   validated using real-time experiments on a hardware-in-loop real-time
   simulator, OPAL-RT OP4510. The results substantiate the efficacy of the

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {59-73},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to minimize the total cost of the system by
   incorporating wind power and plug-in-electric vehicles (PEVs) along with
   demand response (DR) program. The methodologies have proposed in
   contrast with the conventional algorithm in which the transmission line
   investment cost has been minimized without considering the dynamism of
   the deregulated environment. Moreover, the transmission network planning
   enhances the competitiveness of the power market, where more market
   players can participate. In this situation, the network planner has an
   important role in assessing the needs for transmission investments.
   Now-a-days practice of the network planner is to utilize more renewable
   power resources, PEVs and implementation of different electricity price
   tariffs. To achieve more benefits of PEVs and wind energy, their optimal
   utilization is a major concern. This paper proposes a mathematical model
   for solving the combined effect of PEVs and wind power integration with
   incentive-based DR program on static transmission network expansion
   planning (STNEP) problem. To solve this non-linear and non-convex
   problem, a nature-inspired optimization algorithm named gbest-guided
   artificial bee colony algorithm (GABC) is applied due to its robustness.
   The algorithm's performance is evaluated through modified IEEE 24-bus,
   Brazilian 46-bus and Colombian 93-bus system. The test results indicate
   that the combined effect of DR, PEVs and wind has reduced the total
   system cost significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Bi-level planning and scheduling of electric vehicle charging stations
   for peak shaving and congestion management in low voltage distribution
   networks},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Most existing algorithms for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS)
   planning and scheduling of electric vehicles (EVs) do not consider the
   uncertain behavior of EVs and distribution networks, including the EV
   arrival and departure times, user driving needs, and realistic
   residential load and generation profiles. This paper proposes a bi-level
   planning and operation framework that determines the optimal locations
   of EVCS and scheduling of EVs to reduce peak load and network congestion
   in low voltage distribution networks by considering uncertain EV and
   distribution network behavior. Planning of EVCS is performed to minimize
   voltage deviations and distribution network losses. The priority-based
   scheduling algorithm uses the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle
   (G2V) technology to charge the EVs during high priority periods to meet
   the user requirements and discharge during low or medium priority
   periods to reduce the peak load and thermal overloading in distribution
   feeders. Based on an Australian scenario, the proposed method has been
   tested on the IEEE low voltage test feeder. Uncoordinated scheduling of
   EVs is also implemented and compared with the proposed strategy. The
   results show that installing EVCS at the optimal locations can reduce
   the network losses and voltage deviations by 39.38 per cent and 15.32
   per cent, respectively. It is also shown that the proposed scheduling of
   EVs can reduce the peak load of distribution substations and lower the
   network congestion without affecting the EV charging requirements. With
   a 55 percent penetration of EVs, the peak load and thermal overload in
   distribution lines are reduced by 20.53 per cent and 5.88 per cent,

Abstract = {Introduction. The diminishing conventional energy resources and their
   adverse environmental impacts compelled the researchers and industries
   to move towards the nonconventional energy resources. Consequently, a
   drastic paradigm shift is observed in the power and transportation
   sectors from the traditional fossil fuel based to the renewable
   energy-based technologies. Considering the proliferation of electric
   vehicles, the energy companies have been working continuously to extend
   electric vehicle charging facilities. Problem. Down the line, the
   inclusion of electric vehicle charging stations to the electric grid
   upsurges the complication as charging demands are random in nature all
   over the grid, and in turn, an unplanned electric vehicle charging
   station installation may cause for the system profile degradation.
   Purpose To mitigate the problem, optimum allocation of the charging
   stations in existing power distribution system in a strategic manner is
   a matter of pronounced importance in maintaining the system stability
   and power quality. In this paper, optimum allocation of electric vehicle
   charging stations in IEEE 15-bus system is studied in order to minimize
   the highest over and under voltage deviations. Methodology. Primarily,
   voltage stability analysis is carried out for identification of the
   suitable system nodes for the integration. Voltage sensitivity indices
   of all the system nodes are calculated by introducing an incremental
   change in reactive power injection and noting down the corresponding
   change in node voltage for all nodes. Henceforth, dynamic load-flow
   analysis is performed using a fast and efficient power flow analysis
   technique while using particle swarm optimization method in finding the
   optimal locations. Results. The results obtained by the application of
   the mentioned techniques on IEEE 15-bus system not only give the optimum
   feasible locations of the electric vehicle charging stations, but also
   provide the maximum number of such charging stations of stipulated sizes
   which can be incorporated while maintaining the voltage profile.
   Originality. The originality of the proposed work is the development of
   the objective function; voltage stability analysis; power flow analysis
   and optimization algorithms. Practical value The proposed work
   demonstrates the detailed procedure of optimum electric vehicle charging
   station allotment. The experimental results can be used for the
   subsequent execution in real field.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth in the number of electric vehicles (EVs), driven by the
   `double-carbon' target, and the impact of uncontrolled charging and
   discharging behaviour and discharged battery losses severely limit
   electric vehicles' low carbon characteristics. Existing research on
   systemic low-carbon emissions and electric vehicle charging and
   discharging issues is usually determined by considering only carbon
   trading markets or charging and discharging management on the source
   side. In this regard, a coordinated and optimized operation model that
   considers the participation of electric vehicle clusters in deep peaking
   and the source network load and storage adjustable resources is
   proposed. The upper layer establishes a real-time price-based demand
   response mechanism for the load side with the minimum net load
   fluctuation as the objective function; the middle layer establishes a
   comprehensive operation mechanism for the source and storage side that
   includes an orderly charging and discharging peaking compensation
   mechanism for electric vehicles, and a deep peaking mechanism that takes
   into account clean emission, and constructs an optimal operation model
   with the minimum comprehensive operating cost as the objective function;
   the lower layer establishes a distribution network loss minimization
   model for the network side that takes into account the orderly charging
   and discharging of electric vehicle as the objective function. The
   optimal load model with the objective function of minimizing the
   distribution network loss is established at the lower level. Finally,
   the original problem is transformed into a mixed integer linear
   programming problem, and the model's effectiveness is verified by
   setting different scenarios. The model reduces the total cost by
   22.22\%, improves the wind power consumption rate by 19.55\%, reduces
   the actual carbon emission by 16.66\%, and reduces the distribution
   network loss by 13.91\% compared to the basic model.
   Build a coordinated operation model of source-grid, load, and storage
   that takes into account the mobile energy storage characteristics of
   electric vehicles (EVs), to improve the economy and low carbon of system
   operation, to reduce the network loss of distribution network operation,
   and to strengthen the connection between source-grid, load, and storage
   resources; Propose a deep peaking mechanism considering clean emissions,
   improve the operational flexibility of thermal power units, increase the
   consumption rate of new energy, and reduce unit operating costs; Propose
   an orderly charging and discharging peaking compensation mechanism that
   takes into account the cost of electric vehicle discharging losses to
   enhance the willingness of electric vehicle users to participate in
   discharging, reduce the cost of charging and discharging for vehicle
   owners, and assist thermal power units in peaking. image},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {What is the maximum charging rate that a distribution network (DN) can
   permit for electric vehicles (EVs)? This is the question we answer in
   this work by proposing a ``multi-period risk-based stochastic EV hosting
   capacity (EV-HC) framework{''}that explicitly considers the EV charging
   profiles and implicitly the arrival and departure times. Realistic EV
   charging profiles are employed to generate Monte Carlo (MC) scenarios
   that are subsequently utilized for EV-HC calculations. The EV-HC
   outcomes are assessed for critical times (CT) when distribution network
   incidents (DNIs) such as voltage, transformer loading, and line loading
   limit violations are observed. The EV charging simultaneity factor (SF)
   is calculated for these CT instances. We quantify the impact of SF on
   the EV-HC for the first time. Showcasing the efficacy of the proposed
   EV-HC framework and analyzing the SF and CT, we perform three realistic
   case studies for European DNs. These case studies vary in size (small
   and medium-size) and geographically different network topologies, i.e.,
   rural, urban, and semi- urban. The EV-HC is assessed based on four
   distinct power levels of the chargers: 2.7 kW, 3.5 kW, 7 kW, and 11 kW.
   The results indicate that the EV-HC of the Belgian feeder is 7 kW and
   3.5 kW per single charger for the EVs with high and low daily charging
   energy, respectively. We also observe that either nodal voltage
   violation or line or transformer overload could be the dominant
   attribute for EV-HC calculations. Furthermore, either at peak load time
   or off-peak time, the simulation results show that high SF values result
   in DNIs. However, peak-load periods are crucial because a low SF value
   can limit EV-HC.},

Abstract = {The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) will result in a rise
   in electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs), which will have a
   significant effect on the electrical grid. One major issue is deciding
   where to place EVCSs in the power grid in the most optimal way. The
   distribution network is greatly impacted by inadequate EVCS prediction,
   which results in issues with frequency and voltage stability. This paper
   suggests an optimization method called Binary Random Dynamic Arithmetic
   Optimization Algorithm (BRDAOA) that is applied on an IEEE 33 bus
   network to determine the best position for EVCSs as efficiently as
   possible, and the Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) was used in the
   analysis. Considering the system voltage, the load (actual power), and
   the system losses, LSF was calculated for a variety of buses. The
   efficacy of the suggested method is demonstrated by a final comparison
   of its findings with those of the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm
   (AOA) and two additional metaheuristic algorithms. In addition to
   reducing line losses by 2\% compared to the AOA method and 4\% compared
   to the other two metaheuristic optimization methods, the suggested
   optimization approach known as BRDAOA requires less computing time than
   the other three methods. Finally, a reliability test was conducted to
   determine the best location for EVCS in the IEEE 33 BUS system.},

Abstract = {The construction of community charging facilities and supporting
   distribution networks based on the predicted results of electric vehicle
   (EV) charging power in saturation year has resulted in a large initial
   idleness of the distribution network and a serious waste of assets. To
   solve this problem, this paper proposes a collaborative planning method
   for urban community charging facilities and distribution networks.
   First, based on the load density method and occupancy rate to predict
   the base electricity load in the community, the Bass model and charging
   probability are used to predict the community's electric vehicle
   charging load. Taking the minimum annual construction and operation
   costs of the community distribution network as the objective function,
   the power supply topology of the distribution network for a new
   community is optimized by using Prim and single-parent genetic
   algorithms. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified by using the actual
   community data of a certain city in China as an analysis example, and
   the scheme of one-time planning of the distribution network and yearly
   construction of charging facilities is given.},

Abstract = {One of the prominent concerns of big cities is greenhouse gas emission
   due to internal combustion engines of fossil fuel vehicles. Facilitating

   power loss. This paper presents optimal planning of CS in presence of
   capacitors (CAP) to maintain voltage and improve power loss in
   electrical distribution networks. Simulation is carried out on a 34-bus

Abstract = {Large-scale electric vehicle (EV) charging will bring new challenges to
   coordination of grid and transportation. To facilitate large-scale EV
   applications, optimal locating and sizing of charging stations have
   become essential. For the investors of a charging station, economic
   benefit is the primary and the only objective. In this context, this
   work studies the siting and sizing of EV stations based on the optimal
   economic benefit. Benefit changes with time, location and capacity. A
   planning model method considering net present value (NPV) and life cycle
   cost (LCC) is proposed to determine the site and the size of the
   charging stations. The model has integrated distribution network
   constraint, the user constraint and the traffic flow captured
   constraint. Origin-destination lines and voronoi diagram are selected to
   calculate the traffic flow and the service region of each charging
   station, respectively. The quantum genetic algorithm was adopted for a
   better convergence of the planning model. Finally, a coupled 33-node
   distribution system and a 36-node transportation system are used to
   simulate various scenarios in the coupled networks of grid and
   transportation. The simulation results show that by introducing a
   planning model method considering NPV and LCC, the charging station

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {42},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The synergistic integration of the smart grid and smart transportation
   network presents a wealth of data pertaining to the main grid and
   transportation infrastructure, offering valuable insights for electric
   vehicle (EV) owners to navigate their vehicles efficiently. However, the
   unpredictable nature of traffic conditions, charging prices, and waiting
   times at charging stations poses a significant challenge to achieving
   optimal EV navigation. In response to this challenge, a novel navigation
   system is proposed that strives to minimize both total travel time and
   charging costs at charging stations. The approach of this paper involves
   leveraging a unique methodology to determine the shortest path to the
   optimal charging station, which will be one of the renewable charging
   station, non-renewable charging station and mobile EV chargers,
   employing Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient route planning. The system
   takes into account real-time data on traffic dynamics, charging station
   availability, and pricing fluctuations to dynamically adjust navigation
   routes, ensuring that EV owners can make informed decisions on the go.
   To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a series of
   experiments are conducted. The results demonstrate the system's ability
   to optimize both travel time and charging costs, providing a practical
   solution for EV navigation in the face of unpredictable variables. These
   findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing
   EV navigation under dynamic and uncertain conditions, offering practical
   solutions for diverse EV mobility configurations.},

Abstract = {Energy storage systems (ESS) have adopted a new role with the increasing

   This paper presents a new multistage distribution expansion planning

   for EV transportation is performed using a vehicle model based on travel
   patterns. The variability associated with RES along with the demand
   requires the incorporation of uncertainty, which is characterized

   EVCSs and other nonlinear loads is mitigated through the optimal
   allocation of active power filters (APFs). Transformer derating due to
   harmonics is also evaluated, and the transformer rating is upgraded
   accordingly. For robust expansion planning, future load demand is
   predicted using Random Forest (RF) regression, while uncertainties in EV
   driving patterns are managed using the 2m-point estimation method
   (2m-PEM). During solution of the expansion planning problem, this paper
   focuses on minimizing energy losses and costs while maximizing the
   average happiness index (AHI) of the EV users. A multi-objective
   optimization framework is proposed and tested on a practical 40-bus
   distribution network to ensure that the network effectively accommodates
   future demands and enhances overall system performance.},

Abstract = {Despite the environmental and economic benefits of Electric Vehicles
   (EVs), distribution network operators will need to understand the
   location where the charging infrastructure will be placed to ensure EV
   users' needs are met. In this sense, this work proposes a methodology to
   define the optimal location of EV semi-fast charging stations (CS) at a
   neighborhood level, through a multi-objective approach. It applies a
   hierarchical clustering method to define CS service zones, considering
   both technical and mobility aspects. Besides, it considers uncertainties
   related to the EV load profile to determine the CS capacity, based on
   the user's charging behavior. A Pareto Frontier method is deployed to
   support the decision-making process on CS optimal location, considering
   utility and EV users' preferences. The results indicate that the best CS
   locations for mid-term EV penetration can also fit into long-term
   planning, with higher EV charging demand. Thus, these locations would be
   good candidates for the power utility to make initial investments,
   regarding both planning horizons. A real distribution system case is
   used to demonstrate the applicability of the results.},

Title = {Efficient expansion planning of modern multi-energy distribution
   networks with electric vehicle charging stations: A stochastic MILP
   model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
   model developed to address the collaborative expansion planning of
   modern multi-energy distribution networks, taking into account the
   integration of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) in the
   presence of uncertainties. The model is comprehensively formulated to
   encompass Distributed Generation (DG) resources, Electric Vehicles
   (EVs), and Capacitor Banks (CBs), alongside traditional expansion
   options like substations and circuit construction/reinforcement. The
   essence of this Distribution System Expansion Planning (DSEP) problem
   formulation lies in its stochastic approach, featuring chance
   constraints to effectively manage and address uncertainties. The central
   objective of the model is to minimize the total investment and
   operational expenditures associated with the DSEP problem over a
   designated planning horizon. The rigorous application of optimization
   techniques ensures the convergence of the MILP model, thereby delivering
   an efficient and reliable solution. The model's effectiveness is
   initially assessed using an 18-bus system, followed by comprehensive
   testing on a larger 123- bus system to gauge its robustness. Thorough
   performance evaluations are conducted across various case studies,
   encompassing both the 18- bus and 123- bus systems, culminating in the
   validation of the model's resilience, scalability, and replicability.
   These case studies encompass deterministic and stochastic methodologies
   across six distinct scenarios. The numerical outcomes conclusively
   demonstrate that the DSEP solution, when utilizing the stochastic
   approach without considering EVCSs, is associated with elevated costs.
   However, with a strategic allocation strategy for EVCSs, noteworthy
   reductions in investment expenditures related to substations, lines, and
   overall costs are notably achieved. The incorporation of uncertainty
   management within the DSEP problem underscores the flexibility and
   adaptability intrinsic to the proposed stochastic MILP model. These
   attributes render it ideally suited to effectively orchestrating the
   expansion of multi-energy distribution networks in the presence of
   EVCSs, thereby enhancing its utility and relevance in addressing modern
   energy distribution challenges.},

Abstract = {The development of electric vehicle (EV) industry is facing a series of
   issues, among which the efficient charging of multiple EVs needs solving
   desperately. This paper investigates the coordinated charging of
   multiple EVs with the aim of reducing the charging cost, ensuring a high
   battery state of charge (SoC), and avoiding the transformer overload. To
   this end, we first formulate the EV coordinated charging problem with
   the above multiple objectives as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and
   then propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
   algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, a novel interaction model, i.e.,
   communication neural network (CommNet) model, is adopted to realize the
   distributed computation of global information (namely the electricity
   price, the transformer load, and the total charging cost of multiple
   EVs). Moreover, different from the most existing works which make
   specific constraints on the size, the location, or the topology of the
   distribution network, what we need in the proposed method is only the
   transformer load. Besides, due to the use of long and short-term memory
   (LSTM) for price prediction, the proposed algorithm can flexibly deal
   with various uncertain price mechanisms. Finally, simulations are
   presented to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed
   algorithm in a residential charging area.},

Abstract = {Electrified transportation systems and renewable energy resources have
   been recognized as effective environmental-friendly technologies against
   global warming contributed by greenhouse gas (GHG). Remarkably, hydrogen
   fuel cell-powered electric vehicles can outperform battery-powered
   electric vehicles largely in the sense of the driving range and the
   refueling time. However, both of them require a better coordination of
   infrastructure system and renewable energy resources to achieve a
   significant reduction of GHG emissions. This article aims to maximize
   the long-term profitability for the planning model of hydrogen refueling
   stations, where the capacitated flow refueling location model is
   leveraged for maximal traffic flow coverage. Furthermore, we discuss
   various real-world constraints, such as traffic network constraints,
   distribution network constraints, hydrogen balance constraints, and
   energy constraints for electric vehicles, to make the planning model
   more practical. By considering the uncertainty of the short-term
   refueling demand across the city, an approach for geographically
   redistributing hydrogen among the stations is also presented where the
   minimal cost of redistribution is modeled by one-commodity
   pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem. A real-life case study
   of Western Sydney is adopted to testify the efficiency of the planning
   model under current and future cost levels. Finally, a numerical

Abstract = {The increased power demand incurred by electric vehicles (EVs) has
   imposed new challenges on the distribution network. One significant
   responsibility of the distribution network operator (DNO) is to design
   and expand the distribution network periodically to accommodate the
   ever-increasing demand. The previous researches mainly use relaxation
   techniques to enhance the problem tractability, which would involve
   additional binary variables and incur computation burden to the
   optimization problem, or even worse, may lead to an intractable problem.
   This paper develops a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model
   considering various network constraints for the distribution network
   expansion planning under a high penetration level of EVs. The stochastic
   characteristics of demands are addressed through set of scenarios. A
   distributed biased min-consensus algorithm based approach is proposed to
   solve the MINLP model. Finally, comparison tests are conducted on three
   different scales of distribution networks to validate the effectiveness
   of the proposed approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   computation time of the proposed approach is reduced by 42.46\% on
   average for different systems compared with that of the traditional

Volume = {34},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While electric vehicle users enjoy the convenience of electrified
   transportation, their random driving characteristics and disorderly
   charging will cause traffic congestion and aggravate the peak valley
   difference of power grid load. An electric vehicle charging navigation
   strategy that takes into account the idle rate and dynamic tariff is
   proposed in this paper, which improves the load characteristics and
   reduce traffic congestion. Firstly, the electric vehicle charging
   navigation model with the integration of ``four networks and four
   flows{''}is established. The interaction effect between the charging
   demand of electric vehicle users and the information network, traffic
   network, power grid is analyzed. Secondly, the multi-dimensional spatial
   and temporal characteristics of the empty-loading ratio of the electric
   taxi are studied. The optimal charging period for electric vehicle users
   is determined by the intelligent charging navigation terminal based on
   real-time road condition information. The path planning is carried out
   with the goal of minimizing the comprehensive cost of charging time and
   dynamic charging cost, and the electric taxi is guided to the optimal
   charging station to achieve orderly charging in space. Finally, taking
   the coupling system of traffic network and power grid in an urban area
   as an example, the proposed strategy is simulated and analyzed. The
   results show that this strategy can effectively balance the load of each

Title = {A Distributed Coordination Method for Coupled Traffic-Power Network

Abstract = {The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) gradually evolves
   the urban transportation network (UTN) and power distribution network
   (PDN) from being independent to being coupled. To analyze the impact of
   drivers' behavior on the coupled network, and reveal the relationship
   between the two networks, a coupled traffic-distribution (CTD) model is
   proposed, in which the total traveling cost of UTN and the power service
   cost of PDN is minimized. In the CTD model, A stochastic user
   equilibrium traffic assignment problem (SUE-TAP) with elastic traffic
   demand and discrete path selection of drivers is formulated to capture
   the traffic flow distribution comprised of EVs and gasoline vehicles
   (GVs). An alternative current optimal power flow (ACOPF) model of PDN is
   utilized to provide the optimal charging price and scheduling plan.
   Besides, the SUE-TAP with nonlinear functions is difficult to solve, a
   novel piecewise linear approximation method is presented to deal with
   the nonlinear items of the SUE-TAP caused by drivers' traveling cost and
   traveling tendency incorporating perception. Incorporating the
   behavioral theory, a distributed coordination method derived from
   optimal condition decomposition is proposed for the coupled
   traffic-power network equilibrium. The proposed distributed scheme is
   examined using a coupled network, which consists of a 20-road UTN and a
   33-bus PDN. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and
   practicability of the proposed model and the distributed coordination
   method.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the day-ahead operational planning problem of
   radial distribution networks hosting Distributed Energy Resources, such
   as Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and Electric Vehicles (EVs). We present an
   enhanced AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) model that estimates dynamic
   Distribution nodal Location Marginal Costs (DLMCs) encompassing
   transformer degradation as a short-run network variable cost. We
   decompose real/reactive power DLMCs into additive marginal cost
   components representing respectively the costs of real/reactive power
   transactions at the T\&D interface, real/reactive power marginal losses,
   voltage and ampacity congestion, and transformer degradation, capturing
   intertemporal coupling. Decomposition is useful in identifying sources
   of marginal costs and facilitating the employment of distributed AC OPF
   algorithms. DLMCs convey sufficient information to represent the benefit
   of shifting real/reactive power across time and achieve optimal
   Distribution Network and DER operation. We present and analyze actual
   distribution feeder based numerical results involving a wealth of future
   EV/PV adoption scenarios and illustrate the superiority of our approach
   relative to reasonable conventional scheduling alternatives.
   Overwhelming evidence from extensive numerical results supports the
   significant benefits of internalizing short-run marginal asset-primarily

Title = {Day-Ahead Forecast of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand with Deep Neural
   Networks},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increasing penetration rate of electric vehicles, associated with a
   growing charging demand, could induce a negative impact on the electric
   grid, such as higher peak power demand. To support the electric grid,
   and to anticipate those peaks, a growing interest exists for forecasting
   the day-ahead charging demand of electric vehicles. This paper proposes
   the enhancement of a state-of-the-art deep neural network to forecast
   the day-ahead charging demand of electric vehicles with a time
   resolution of 15 min. In particular, new features have been added on the
   neural network in order to improve the forecasting. The forecaster is
   applied on an important use case of a local charging site of a hospital.
   The results show that the mean-absolute error (MAE) and root-meansquare
   error (RMSE) are respectively reduced by 28.8\% and 19.22\% thanks to
   the use of calendar and weather features. The main achievement of this
   research is the possibility to forecast a high stochastic aggregated EV
   charging demand on a day-ahead horizon with a MAE lower than 1 kW.},

Abstract = {With the increasing prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs), the EV
   charging station (EVCS) and power distribution have become a coupled

   generation (SG) method is adopted. Further, a multi-objective
   optimisation tool, Multi-Objective Natural Aggregation Algorithm

Abstract = {Modern residential communities in urban systems can benefit from energy
   storage devices and smart control technologies to implement self-energy
   supply and energy efficient load management. In this paper, a
   multi-stage energy management framework is proposed for smart

   determine their operation schedules via energy allocation and home

Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper, we determine the maximum number of battery electric
   vehicles (BEVs) that can be charged simultaneously at full power during
   peak load hour without overloading transformer and lines or causing an
   unacceptable voltage drop in the low-voltage (LV) grid. In order to
   predict the BEVs charging demand, an application that takes into account
   the random user's arrival time and the initial battery state of charge
   (SOC) was developed using the C++ programming language and the Qt
   toolkit. The network analysis was then carried out using the
   Quasi-Dynamic Simulation (QDS) toolbox in DIgSILENT PowerFactory on a
   typical German LV grid for a metropolitan urban area. The simulation
   findings indicate that the value of simultaneity factor (SF) plays an
   important role in identifying the most robust and weakest grid's
   bottlenecks. There is currently no immediate threat of electromobility
   pushing the parameters of the grid to their unacceptable limits;
   however, it is essential to examine the LV grid's bottlenecks and
   gradually prepare them for the ramp-up of BEVs. In the short term, the
   bottlenecks can be removed using conservative planning and operating
   principles; however, employing novel approaches will be crucial in the
   longer term.},

Abstract = {Failing to account for the diverse charging behaviors of electric
   vehicle (EV) users across different regions often leads to inaccuracies
   in planning community charging facilities, resulting in either
   overestimating or underestimating charger demand. This paper addresses
   this gap by proposing a customer segmentation-based approach for optimal
   charger distribution to assist policymakers and distribution network
   operators in the early stages of EV adoption. This work comprises two
   main parts: representing plugin behaviors through customer segmentation
   and optimal charger allocation in community distribution networks.
   Customer segmentation is conducted using an unsupervised clustering
   algorithm, with EV adoption features selected based on their importance
   scores using regional EV availability. Primary plugin behaviors, based
   on Australian contexts, consider arrival time, charger preferences,
   driving patterns, and initial state of charge, while secondary
   behaviors, such as plugin intervals and energy needs, are modeled using
   probabilistic simulations. Utilizing secondary plugin variables, this
   research employs a two-stage multi-objective optimization approach to
   find optimal locations and sizes of community chargers in the IEEE-33
   bus system coupled with a road network. The results reveal that customer
   plugin diversities impact charger distribution plans, highlighting the

Title = {Eco-power management system with operation and voltage security
   objectives of distribution system operator considering networked virtual
   power plants with electric vehicles parking lot and price-based demand
   response},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {121},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the energy management of a network, it is expected that by extracting
   the optimal performance for the power sources, storage equipment, and
   responsive demand, a favorable economic and technology situation is
   achievable for the network and the mentioned elements. Virtual power
   plants, as a unit aggregating resources, storage, and responsive loads,
   can create more favorable conditions in network energy management. So,
   it is expected that the positive effect of the virtual power plant
   format on the economic and technical situation of the distribution
   system is far more than those of managing individual elements mentioned
   in the network. Consequently, the distribution network operator's
   economic, environmental, and technical goals are met through the
   concurrent administration of reactive and active power in the smart
   distribution network that is equipped with a flexible-sustainable
   virtual power plant. The system operator is accountable for reducing the
   weighted sum of the voltage security index, energy loss, and energy cost
   of the distribution network. This problem is associated with the optimal
   power flow formulation, which considers the environmental limits and
   security of voltage in the distribution network, the renewable resource
   operation model and flexibility in the form of a virtual power plant,
   and the system's flexibility constraints. Flexibility resources
   considered in the present study are pricebased demand response and
   electric vehicle parking lots. Stochastic optimization relying on the
   Unscented Transform assists in providing a suitable model for uncertain
   quantities resulting from the amount of load, electric vehicles,
   renewable power, and price of energy and eventually shortens the
   computing time and accurately computes the flexibility index. The
   optimal compromise solution amongst various objective functions can be
   found through fuzzy decisionmaking. Some innovations of this research
   include concurrent administration of active and reactive power in
   virtual power plant, concurrent modeling of economic, operational,
   environmental, voltage security, and flexibility indicators in the
   distribution network, utilization of electric vehicles, and demand
   response as a source of flexibility, use of Unscented transform for
   modeling the uncertainties corresponding to the exact calculation of
   flexibility. The suggested method was simulated in the IEEE 69-bus
   radial smart distribution system. Regarding the numerical report
   obtained, the optimal performance of each of the renewable generation,
   demand response, and parking of electric vehicles can significantly
   impact the economic and technical condition of the distribution network.
   However, the best condition was obtained when the mentioned elements
   were placed in the form of a virtual power plant. So, in such a
   situation, the energy cost is around \$1862 for the said network. The
   lowest value for the worst security index in this network is around
   0.933 p.u. Energy loss, maximum voltage drop, and peak load carrying
   capability are equal to 1.902 MWh, 0.047 p.u., and 5.624 MW,
   respectively. As a result, and based on numerical findings, the method
   can attain sustainable social welfare. The optimal power scheduling of

Title = {Evaluation of Electric Vehicles Hosting Capacity Based on Interval
   Undervoltage Probability in a Distribution Network},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {140147-140155},
Abstract = {The rapidly growing market for electric vehicles (EVs) and chargers has
   a considerable influence on the operation of the distribution network.
   Accurate evaluation of the number of EVs penetrating the distribution
   network, that is, the hosting capacity (HC) of EVs, is beneficial to
   distribution network planning and efficient operation. Further, EVs have
   uncertainties in terms of arrival time, departure time, battery state of
   charge (SOC), and choice of charging station, which collectively affect
   the system difficult, but important, step of modeling EV uncertainties
   on system performance. This paper presents a methodology to model how
   many EVs can penetrate a low voltage distribution network, especially
   microgrid. First, EV load modeling incorporating uncertainties is
   performed by applying interval and affine arithmetic. Second, to analyze
   the effects of voltage, the same arithmetic methods are extended to
   perform power flow calculation. Thirdly, interval undervoltage
   probability (IUP) is introduced to evaluate the HC of the EVs.
   Subsequently, a voltage violation index (VVI) is introduced, and an EV
   HC evaluation method is proposed, assisting in the flexible operation of
   the network based on VVI. The utility of the proposed method is
   demonstrated by modeling the network of Seoul National University in
   South Korea, which is subsequently compared with the conventional
   approach of determining EV HC. The model incorporated Seoul National
   University's practical cable data, load data, and vehicle access data,
   along with the number of EVs penetrating the target network.},

Abstract = {High penetration of renewable energy brings economic and environmental
   benefits to the grid, but also causes challenges to the distribution
   system flexibility due to its uncertainty. As a new variable load,
   electric vehicles (EVs) can increase system's flexibility through
   interactions with the grid and promote the consumption of renewable
   energy. This paper studies the flexibility evaluation of distribution
   system considering the interaction between EVs and the grid. Firstly,
   the charging and discharging control strategies of EVs have been
   analyzed to reduce the impact of renewable energy output fluctuations on
   the distribution system flexibility, such as the G2V (Grid to vehicle)
   and V2G (Vehicle to grid) modes. Secondly, the battery capacity, driving
   plan, and transportation network are modeled to study the impact of the
   EVs connected to the grid on the distribution system flexibility.
   Thirdly, the flexibility evaluation method of distribution network is
   proposed based on the feasibility analysis of uncertain region. Finally,
   the analyses of the example show that the proposed method can realize
   the evaluation of the time series flexibility of the distribution

Abstract = {The need for frequency regulation capacity increases as the fraction of
   renewable energy sources grows in the electricity market. An aggregator
   can provide frequency regulation by controlling its generation and
   demand. Here we investigate the participation of an aggregator
   controlling a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) and an energy storage
   (ES) in day-ahead regulation and energy markets and determine the
   optimal size of the aggregator's bids. The problem is formulated as a
   stochastic mixed integer linear programming model, taking into account
   the uncertainties regarding energy and frequency regulation prices. The
   risks associated with the uncertainties are managed using the
   conditional value-at-risk method. Because most EVs are charged in
   residential distribution networks, load flow constraints are also taken
   into account. A linear formulation based on the rainflow cycle counting
   algorithm is proposed to include the ES degradation costs incurred from
   following the frequency regulation signals into the objective function.
   The problem is studied within the context of amedium-voltage
   distribution network adopting the market rules of the California
   Independent System Operator. The results of the numerical analysis show
   howjoint optimization of EVs and ES can improve the aggregator's profit,
   and verify that the proposed degradation cost formulation can
   effectively minimize the degradation costs of the ES.},

   Electric vehicles (EVs) can bring up significant benefits such as

Abstract = {Vehicles (EVs) have been shown to be better for the environment since
   they emit lesser air pollutants compared to fuel-based vehicles. High
   penetration of EVs in the distribution network contributes to the
   increment of capital investment in smart grid technologies. This is
   because EVs' charging operation involves a considerably high level of
   electricity due to the size of EVs' battery charging period. Poor
   scheduling of EVs charging operation will lead to an increment in
   electricity consumption. This will then lead to overloading of
   distribution network, voltage quality degradation, power loss increment,
   and dispatch of uneconomical energy sources. Hence, coordinated, and
   smart charging schemes are vital in order to reduce charging costs. This
   paper proposes an optimized EV battery charging and discharging
   scheduling model using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on
   three charging scenarios. The daily charging and discharging schedule of

Abstract = {Recent advancements in the electric vehicle (EV) battery technologies

   This necessitates a quantitative approach for determining the load

   addresses the planning and operation problem from the perspective of
   grid stability by determining the load profile of electric vehicle

   optimization, ensuring that technical constraints are met, even under
   worst-case demand scenarios. The objective function incorporates annual
   energy losses and construction costs as annualized expenses, offering a

   showing optimal conductor sizes for various load scenarios and
   validating its application for reconductoring in medium voltage

   electricity infrastructure},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The development of emerging smart grid technologies has led to more and
   more penetration of renewable energy resources and electric energy
   storage in the residential sectors. Besides, owing to the significant
   evolution of power electronic devices, there is a rapid growth in
   penetration of DC loads and generations, such as PV and electric
   vehicles (EVs), into the buildings and homes as a building block of the
   future smart cities. This is despite the fact that the electricity
   infrastructure of the conventional buildings is designed based on AC
   electricity and as a result, there would be a lot of losses due to the
   frequent power conversion from AC to DC and vice versa. Besides,
   according to a significant amount of energy consumption in the
   residential sector, buildings have a prominent role to confront
   environmental problems and obtain sustainability. In such circumstances,
   and considering the energy outlook, rethinking the electrification
   structure of the built environment is necessary. This work is an effort
   in this regard and looks for a sustainable energy infrastructure for the
   cyber-physical homes of the future. Three disparate electrification
   architectures are analyzed. The proposed framework, which is formulated
   as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, not only considers
   costs associated with investment and operation but also evaluates the
   reliability of each structure by considering the different ratios of DC
   loads. Moreover, the optimal size of renewable energy resources and the
   effect of EV demand response, and different prices of PV and battery are
   precisely investigated. The efficacy of the proposed approach is
   evaluated via numerical simulation.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the major proportion of fossil fuels is consumed in the
   transportation systems. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can play a
   significant role in reducing the petrol consumption. A large amount of
   additional electrical power demand needed for the charging of PEVs may
   adversely affect the electric grid reliability. Using the charging
   station in the micro-grids (MGs) to minimise the total system operation
   cost in the presence of PEVs with vehicle to grid (V2G) capability is
   becoming vitally important. In this work, a practical model for charging
   strategy of PEVs based on typical charge and discharge profiles given by
   the battery producers is considered. The problem is constrained by the
   loss of load probability index of reliability. The proposed strategy
   makes it possible to handle the generation shortage due to the outage of
   conventional units and intermittency of wind turbine units. Mixed
   Integer Non-linear programming is used for the optimal planning of MG in
   the presence of PEVs. Results show that an appropriate charge and
   discharge strategy may lead to a significant improvement in the
   reliability of the considered MG as well as a reduction in the
   operational cost of the total system.},

Abstract = {Progressive popularization of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) calls for
   synergistic deployment of public charging infrastructures to serve the
   recharging needs in future urban systems. For this end, a new planning
   framework to facilitate efficient accommodation of PEVs via gridable
   parking lots (PLs) is proposed in this study. Different from most
   previous works, the presented method explicitly considers the potential
   uncertainties in the users' behaviors in the PL planning, which will
   allow decision-makers to better assess the effect of human factors on
   the efficiency of their investment. Moreover, the concerned PL
   allocation problem has been investigated in conjunction with the optimal
   contract offer for PEV users to obtain the final planning scheme. The
   overall problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming
   model, where the first-stage mainly deals with the planning decisions
   associated with PLs, including siting and sizing of PLs and contractual
   arrangements; while the second stage evaluates the operational
   performance of the suggested PL system under different scenario
   realizations of PEV behaviors. A combinatorial optimization algorithm is
   used to solve the problem. The proposed framework is demonstrated on an
   illustrative testing system and numerical results verify the

Abstract = {This study proposes a charging demand forecasting model for electric

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Due to varying energy demands and supply levels in different regions,
   the distribution of power load exhibits an imbalanced state. It
   contributes to increased power loss and poses a threat to the security
   constraints of the electrical grid. Simultaneously, the global energy
   transition has led to a continuous increase in the proportion of
   renewable energy integrated into the grid. Electric vehicles (EVs),
   serving as representative of renewable energy, further magnify this load
   imbalance with their charging requirements, which poses a significant
   challenge to the stable operation of the grid. Therefore, to ensure the
   smooth operation of the grid under the context of renewable energy
   integration, the authors investigate the coordinated strategies of EV
   charging scheduling and route planning. The authors first model the
   coupling of the transportation network with the smart grid as a
   cyber-physical system. Subsequently, the authors simulate and analyse
   the daily charging load curve of the network, capturing the travel
   characteristics of EVs. Based on this, the authors research the EV
   charging scheduling in both individual and collective travel scenarios
   during peak and off-peak hours. For the off-peak travel period of EVs, a
   charging schedule strategy based on travel plans is proposed, which
   reduces the time cost of EV owners' travel. Furthermore, for the
   collective travel of a large number of EVs within the system, a multi-EV
   charging scheduling strategy based on charging station load balancing is
   presented. This strategy effectively balances the load levels of various
   charging stations while reducing the overall system travel time.
   Ultimately, through experimental results, the authors demonstrate that
   by deploying appropriate charging scheduling strategies, EVs cease to be
   a burden on the grid and can be transformed into tools for balancing the
   loads across different regions.

   method that uses both the grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle

   The proposed DBS was simulated in real time and phasor analysis for
   different penetration levels in MATLAB/Simulink program. Considering
   that EV driver behavior is highly variable and will vary regionally, it
   is shown that the proposed DBS gives dynamic results against all

Abstract = {Modeling and allocation of the Electric vehicles Charging Stations

   the EVCS, first, with the aim of peak shaving, valley filling, and
   flattening the load curve of the network, the optimal planning of EV's
   charging/discharging is devised. In this regard, after modeling
   involving random variables, a novel hybrid method, based on the Multi

   sequential Monte Carlo simulation is presented. The purpose of the
   presented optimal charge/discharge schedule is to control the rate and
   time of charging/discharging of EVs. In the proposed model, various
   battery operation strategies, including Uncontrolled Charging Mode
   (UCM), Controlled Charging Mode (CCM), and Smart Charge/Discharge Mode
   (SCDM) are also considered. In the next step, in order to implement the
   charge/discharge schedule of the EVCS profitably, a new formulation is
   presented for the allocation of two EVCSs (administrative and
   residential EVCS). In the proposed formulation, various objective
   functions such as power loss reduction, reducing power purchases from
   the upstream network, reducing voltage deviation in buses, improving
   reliability is addressed. Moreover, to incentivize the owner to
   construct the EVCS with adopted charging/discharging schedule, the
   optimal profits sharing between Distribution System Operator (DSO) and

Title = {Optimizing Highway Electric Vehicle Scheduling and Battery Swapping
   Station Management for Enhanced Renewable Energy Utilization},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The separation of battery charging and swapping processes enables
   highway operators to more flexibly manage the recharging of depleted
   batteries at battery swapping stations (BSSs), while also leveraging
   renewable energy (RE) resources to lower electricity costs. However,
   previous studies have not addressed the connection between BSS
   recharging strategies and the demand for fully charged batteries, which
   is determined by EV swapping schemes. To address this gap, the paper
   proposes a joint optimization approach for scheduling EVs and managing
   BSSs, considering RE generation along the highway. Specifically, a
   spatial-temporal network model is developed to represent the
   transportation-energy characteristics of EVs, incorporating BSS
   selection and battery swapping processes. Additionally, a BSS management
   model is formulated to plan the recharging of depleted batteries and
   ensure the availability of fully charged batteries to meet the swapping
   demands of EVs. The Lagrange relaxation algorithm is employed to handle
   the interaction between EV scheduling and BSS operations. A case study
   shows that this method effectively coordinates EV swapping schemes with
   BSS recharging strategies, resulting in a 17.3\% improvement in RE
   generation utilization and a reduction in grid electricity consumption
   by RMB 1753.8.},

Abstract = {With electrical performance similar to that of energy storage systems,
   electric vehicles (EVs) show great potential for demand response to
   facilitate higher penetration of distributed renewable energy.
   Therefore, this article presents a look-ahead scheduling model for EVs
   to offer a load curtailment service in a distribution network, with the
   aim of smoothing out the power fluctuations caused by distributed
   renewable energy sources. An equivalent aggregation method that is not
   sensitive to heterogeneous private parameters is used to extract the
   overall dynamic power regulation characteristics of the EV population,
   while a decomposition model ensures the completion of the regulation
   task. Besides, in the scheduling model, the variable baselines are
   dynamically refreshed to capture the load rebound effects caused by load
   curtailment, allowing more accurate regulation plans to be obtained. A
   two-stage iterative solution strategy is also adopted to obtain the
   approximate optimal solution. Simulations demonstrate both the accuracy
   of the aggregation model and the effectiveness of the scheduling model.},

Title = {Real-time charging coordination of plug-in electric vehicles based on
   hybrid fuzzy discrete particle swarm optimization},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {19-29},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The main impact of uncoordinated plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging
   is adding new time-variant loads that can increase the strains on the
   generation units, transmission and distribution systems that may result
   in unacceptable voltage drops and poor power quality. This paper
   proposes two dynamic online approaches for coordination of PEV charging
   based on fuzzy genetic algorithm (FGA) and fuzzy discrete particle swarm
   optimization (FDPSO). The algorithms will minimize the costs associated
   with energy generation and grid losses while also maximizing the
   delivered power to PEVs considering distribution transformer loading,
   voltage regulation limits, initial and final battery state of charges
   (SOCs) based on consumers' preferences. The second algorithm relies on
   the quality and speed of DPSO solution for more accurate and faster
   online coordination of PEVs while also exploiting fuzzy reasoning for
   shifting charging demands to off-peak hours for a further reduction in
   overall cost and transformer loading. Simulation results for
   uncoordinated, DPSO, FGA and FDPSO coordinated charging are presented
   and compared for a 449-node network populated with PEVs. Results are
   also compared with the previously published PEV coordinated charging
   based on maximum sensitivity selections (MSS). Main contributions are
   formulating the PEVs charging coordination problem and applying
   different optimization methods including online FGA and FDPSO
   considering different driving patterns, battery sizes and charging
   rates, as well as initial SOCs and requested final SOCs. (C) 2015

Title = {Rural Photovoltaic Storage and Charging Integrated Charging Station
   Capacity Allocation Strategy based on Tariff Compensation Mechanism},
Journal = {RECENT ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL \& ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {600-612},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Background In order to help the ``carbon peaking and carbon neutrality
   goals{''}, the current new energy vehicle to the countryside policy for
   the local use of renewable energy and demand-side carbon reduction
   provides a good opportunity but also requires rural townships and
   villages of electric vehicle charging infrastructure planning ahead.
   However, due to the current low rural electric vehicle ownership, the
   charging price compensation mechanism is not yet perfect, resulting in
   the planning period of electric vehicle growth and the willingness to
   respond to the tariff compensation policy is difficult to accurately
   assess.Methods This paper proposes a rural photovoltaic storage and
   charging integrated charging station capacity allocation strategy based
   on the tariff compensation mechanism. Firstly, we construct a
   spatial-temporal dynamic distribution model of rural EV charging load
   coupled with distribution network - transportation network, and on this
   basis, we consider the rural EV charging time-sharing tariff and tariff
   compensation policy incentive, and amend the EV charging load transfer
   model; and then we construct an optimization planning model of charging
   station with the goal of minimizing the cost of construction, operation
   and maintenance, and maximizing the charging benefit of the integrated
   charging station in the rural area, and obtain the optimal synergistic
   planning scheme under the tariff compensation mechanism in the planning
   period.Results The optimal collaborative planning scheme under the
   electricity price compensation mechanism is obtained, and the
   correctness and validity of the proposed optimal planning method of the
   rural optical storage charging station under the electricity price
   compensation mechanism is verified by the example, which is of positive
   significance in the promotion of the charging facilities to go to the
   countryside in an appropriate manner, and in the stimulation of the
   willingness of the rural consumers in the townships to purchase
   vehicles.Conclusion (1) The spatial and temporal distribution and
   transfer model of rural EV charging loads with price incentives is
   constructed by taking into account the preferential charging price
   policies such as rural time-sharing tariff and tariff compensation
   mechanism. By comparing the operating revenues of optical
   storage-charging integrated charging stations with and without
   time-sharing tariffs and tariff compensation policies, we verified the
   incentive effect of multiple types of price incentives for the
   over-planning of rural electric vehicle charging facilities. (2) The
   proposed optimal configuration method of rural photovoltaic, storage and
   charging integration charging station can realize the in-situ
   utilization of rural renewable energy, tap the price competitiveness of
   photovoltaic, storage and charging integration, and weaken the cost of
   electricity consumption. By comparing the optimized configuration scheme
   with and without joint planning, it is verified that the moderate
   configuration of in-situ photovoltaic and energy storage equipment on
   the basis of the planning of charging piles brings benefits far
   exceeding the investment cost, and has a great role in increasing the
   operational efficiency of rural charging facilities.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In order to recover the power supply of critical loads after an
   accidental blackout, a critical load restoration strategy in coupled
   power distribution and traffic networks considering spatio-temporal
   scheduling of electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed in this paper. First,
   an EV route planning model is established based on the traffic network.
   And a multi-period coordination load restoration model is constructed
   containing distributed generators and EV charging stations. Next,
   simultaneously considered as constraints, the traffic network and power
   distribution network are coupled and the route planning model is
   integrated into the load restoration model to realize the
   spatio-temporal scheduling of EVs. The load recovery, the power
   distribution network economy, and EV driving cost are taken into
   consideration at the same time. Then, piecewise linearization,
   second-order conic relaxation (SOCR), and deterministic transformation
   of chance constraints are leveraged to reformulate the model. Finally,
   comparative analysis of the scheduling results in specific faulty
   scenarios is conducted on different strategies, confidence levels of
   chance constraints, and penalty factors. Numerical studies have proven
   the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy, and the

Abstract = {To unlock the green potential of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable
   energy sources are necessary for forming a decarbonized grid. With the
   rising demand for EVs and fast-charging stations (FCSs), the
   installation of renewable-based distributed generators (DGs) can further
   defer network upgrades and minimize energy losses. In this article, a
   new planning model is proposed to site and size FCSs and wind-based DGs,
   taking into account the stochastic nature of FCSs, residential EV loads,
   and renewable generation. The proposed planning model considers
   different cost and revenue components associated with FCSs and
   wind-based DGs. A typical distribution network is overlaid on a
   geographic map to illustrate how the network is connected with the
   municipal layout, thus taking into account practical constraints for
   installing FCSs and DGs in the vicinity of each bus. A novel scoring
   scheme that considers practical geographical aspects is developed to
   quantify the attractiveness of FCS candidate locations to the drivers of
   EVs. This scheme is essential to ensure installing FCSs at locations
   that maximize revenue to investors. Results demonstrate that planning
   for both FCSs and wind-based DGs is effective from a financial

Abstract = {Residential-scale low carbon technologies (LCTs) can help decarbonizing
   our economies but can also lead to technical issues, particularly in low
   voltage (LV) distribution systems. To quantify these problems this work
   proposes a probabilistic impact assessment methodology. First, realistic
   5-min time-series daily profiles are produced for photovoltaic panels,
   electric heat pumps, electric vehicles, and micro combined heat and
   power units. Then, to cater for the uncertainties of LCTs (e.g., size,
   location, and behavior), a Monte Carlo analysis is carried out
   considering 100 simulations for different penetration levels (percentage
   of houses with a LCT). This methodology is applied to 128 real U.K. LV
   feeders showing that about half of them can have voltage and/or
   congestion issues at some penetration of LCTs. Furthermore, to identify
   the relationships between the first occurrence of problems and key
   feeder parameters (e.g., length, number of customers), a correlation
   analysis is developed per LCT. Crucially, these results can be
   translated into lookup tables to help distribution network operators in
   producing preliminary estimates of the LCT hosting capacity of a given

Abstract = {In response to the growing integration of battery energy storage systems
   (BESS), electric vehicles (EV), and distributed generation (DG),
   planning frameworks have emerged to optimize the deployment of these

   introduces an artificial intelligence (AI) approach utilizing the

Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With deregulation of the power industry, environmental policy changes,
   advancements in technology, and the transformation to smart grid, the
   distribution planning paradigm has gone through significant changes in
   recent years. Concurrently, with increase in gas prices, driven by a
   foreseeable fossil fuel depletion in the future, developments in the
   automotive sector, and environmental concerns, penetration of plug-in
   electric vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing. These changes will
   continue to drive the distribution planning problem to evolve in the
   coming years. This paper presents a comprehensive long-term distribution
   planning framework from the perspective of local distribution companies
   (LDCs) considering distributed generation (DG), substations, capacitors,
   and feeders. Apart from considering the usual demand profile, the
   proposed framework considers uncontrolled and controlled (smart) PEV
   charging demand, as well as demand response (DR) options. Based on a
   back-propagation algorithm combined with cost-benefit analysis, a novel
   approach is proposed to determine the optimal upgrade plan, allocation,
   and sizing of the selected components in distribution systems, to
   minimize the total capital and operating cost. A new iterative method is
   proposed which involves post-processing the plan decisions to guarantee
   acceptable adequacy levels for each year of the planning horizon. The
   performance of the proposed framework is examined considering several
   case studies on the 33-bus and 69-bus test systems. It is noted from the
   studies that the presence of uncontrolled PEV charging loads results in
   much higher plan costs as compared to the case without PEVs, impacts the
   distribution plan significantly, and hence these loads indeed need be
   considered in the planning process. On the other hand, smart charging of
   PEV5 have a much reduced impact on the plan cost, and helps alleviate
   some investments which were needed with uncontrolled charging PEVs.
   Therefore, the LDCs and policy makers need to encourage customers to
   adapt these options in the long-run. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The rapid rise in the grid integration of low-carbon technologies, e.g.
   renewable energy sources (RESs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs),
   has led to several challenges in distribution networks (DNs). This is
   due to the intermittent generation of RESs and uncertain loads of PEVs,
   both of which necessitate enhancing the flexibility requirements at the
   distribution level so as to accommodate the high penetration of these
   clean technologies in the future. To address such issues, this study
   proposes a mixed-integer linear programming-based expansion planning
   model for DNs considering the impact of high RES and PEV penetration,
   the associated uncertainties, and providing flexibility requirements at
   the distribution level. In this respect, the spherical simplex unscented
   transformation, an analytical uncertainty modelling method, is
   implemented in the planning model to take into account the forecasting
   errors of the uncertain green technologies. Also, in order to estimate
   the electric vehicle parking lot demand at each load node of the
   network, a new approach for PEV-charging model is suggested. To
   investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
   probabilistic planning model, it is implemented on two test DNs, and the

Abstract = {With the large-scale integration of high-penetration distributed
   photovoltaic (DPV) into distribution networks, its output volatility and
   reverse power flow characteristics are prone to causing voltage
   violations, necessitating the accurate identification of weak nodes to
   enhance operational reliability. This paper investigates the definition,
   quantification criteria, and multi-indicator comprehensive determination
   methods for weak nodes in distribution networks. A multi-criteria
   assessment method integrating voltage deviation rate, sensitivity
   analysis, and power margin has been proposed. This method quantifies the
   node disturbance resistance and comprehensively evaluates the
   vulnerability of voltage stability. Simulation validation based on the
   IEEE 33-node system demonstrates that the proposed method can
   effectively identify the distribution patterns of weak nodes under
   different penetration levels (20 similar to 80\%) and varying numbers of
   DPV access points (single-point to multi-point distributed access
   scenarios). The study reveals the impact of increased penetration and
   dispersed access locations on the migration characteristics of weak
   nodes. The research findings provide a theoretical basis for the
   planning of distribution networks with high-penetration DPV, offering
   valuable insights for optimizing the siting of volatile loads such as
   electric vehicle (EV) charging stations while considering both grid
   safety and the demand for distributed energy accommodation.},

Abstract = {In micro-grids, energy management is described as an information and
   control system that assures that both the generating and distribution
   systems deliver electricity at the lowest operating costs. Renewable
   energy sources (RESs), including electric vehicles (EVs), can be
   successfully used and carbon emissions reduced by establishing a DC
   multi-microgrid system (MMGS), which includes renewable energy sources
   (RESs) and the distribution network. A Multi-Microgrid based Energy
   Management (MM-GEM) system is suggested to increase the economics of
   MMGS and minimize the distribution network's network loss. MMG is a
   network of dispersed generators, energy storage, and adjustable loads in
   a distribution system that is linked. Furthermore, its operation is
   deconstructed to reduce communication and control costs with the
   decentralized structure. ``Aside from enhancing system resilience, the
   MMGEMS substantially impacts energy efficiency, power quality, and
   dependability{''}. Typical MMGEMS functionality and architecture are
   shown in detail. This is followed by examining current and developing
   technologies for monitoring and interacting with data among the MMG
   clusters. In addition, a wide range of MMG energy planning and control
   systems for interactive energy trading, multi-energy management, and
   resilient operations are fully examined and researched. The economic
   effect of the EVs' energy transfer over time and place is examined.},

Title = {Conjugate active and reactive power management in a smart distribution
   network through electric vehicles: A mixed integer -linear programming
   model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Electrical Vehicles (EVs) have a growing penetration rate in many
   countries aimed at the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and
   declining environmental issues. The high penetration rate of EVs, as new
   electrical energy demands, can cause operational problems for
   distribution networks. Therefore, designing and implementation of
   monitoring and management mechanisms for EVs charging is a necessity.
   EVs are equipped with power electronic-based chargers, bringing them a
   high degree of flexibility in conjugate active and reactive power
   control. This capability can be employed not only to reduce the adverse
   impacts of the high penetration rate of EVs on distribution networks
   operation but also to support the active and reactive management in
   distribution networks. In this paper, to employ EVs conjugate active and
   reactive power control capability, a model for central active and
   reactive power management in a smart distribution network is proposed.
   The proposed model is an optimization problem in which the objective
   function consists of two terms, namely, ``minimizing the cost of
   energy{''} and ``improving the voltage profile{''}, over the operation
   planning horizon. The constraints of the optimization problem include
   distribution network operation constraints and charging and discharging
   constraints related to the EVs batteries and chargers. This problem is
   modelled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem and is
   implemented on the 33-bus, 69-bus, and 133-bus distribution networks.
   The results show that the proposed model can obtain the lowest energy
   cost and energy loss and the best operational voltage profile in a
   completely acceptable calculation time. Moreover, by using the proposed
   model, supplying the required energy for EVs during their plugin time
   interval is guaranteed and, increasing the penetration rate of EVs into
   the network is facilitated. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We propose the vehicle-originating-signals (VOS) approach for charging
   control of a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) in an electricity
   distribution network (DN). The goal of the approach is to manage the EV

   demand and solar generation, closely follows a given target profile. The
   VOS approach enables EVs in a fleet to compute signals reflecting their
   need for charge and willingness to supply power. An aggregator collects
   these signals and implements the control with minor computational
   effort. We evaluate the VOS approach on a scenario for Munich, Germany,
   based on a mobility survey and real electricity demand and solar
   generation data. First, we compare our approach against a centralized
   optimization in terms of objective fulfillment and solving time. We show
   that it achieves a competitive performance, especially for large vehicle
   fleets. Second, we present a statistical method to evaluate the
   performance and limitations of our approach. We identify a recommended
   range of the vehicle fleet size for a given load magnitude and show that
   the target profiles can be met with a defined certainty. Finally, we
   present a method for further reducing the communication overhead with

Abstract = {Proper planning for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations along with

   loss for better planning of fast-charging stations. To get charged, the
   appropriate fast-charging station and its best route are decided through
   minimum energy consumption by the EVs, considering traffic congestion
   and distances. Up-gradation of lines, up-gradation of the substation,
   addition of new fast-charging station, allocation of DSTATCOM and
   allocation of renewable-based distributed generation are performed for
   distribution network expansion planning. The whole work is formulated in
   three layers with a sub-layer. Uncertainties of EV driving patterns,

Abstract = {Under the pressure of climate change, the transportation sector is under
   electrification, and electric vehicles (EVs) are encouraged to reduce
   their reliance on fossil fuels. However, in those regions where coal is
   a dominating power generation fuel source, different opinions about
   whether EVs can help emission reduction exist. In other words, whether
   EVs can help emission reduction depends on the energy system
   configuration and the power generation mix. To achieve the overall
   emission reduction in both systems, a collaborative planning strategy
   for electricity and transportation systems is proposed. In the
   electricity distribution network, the renewable energy source is planned
   to cope with future demand growth due to the increasing use of EVs. In
   the transportation network, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are
   introduced to realize the coordinated development of different types of
   vehicles. The location of the hydrogen refueling stations can be
   planned, and the penetration ratio of internal combustion vehicles, EVs,
   and FCVs is optimized. The proposed planning model is verified on the
   46-bus electricity distribution network and the 21-bus transportation
   network. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and subgradient
   methods are employed to solve the proposed optimization model. According
   to the simulation results, the proposed model can achieve the lowest
   emission since the electricity and transportation systems can cooperate

Abstract = {This paper presents the distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP)
   method through quadratic programming (QP) designed to alleviate the
   congestion that might occur in a distribution network with high
   penetration of flexible demands. In the DLMP method, the distribution
   system operator (DSO) calculates dynamic tariffs and publishes them to
   the aggregators, who make the optimal energy plans for the flexible
   demands. The DLMP through QP instead of linear programing as studied in
   previous literatures solves the multiple solution issue of the
   aggregator optimization which may cause the decentralized congestion
   management by DLMP to fail. It is proven in this paper, using convex
   optimization theory, the aggregator's optimization problem through QP is
   strictly convex and has a unique solution. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
   conditions and the unique solution of the aggregator optimization ensure
   that the centralized DSO optimization and the decentralized aggregator
   optimization converge. Case studies using a distribution network with
   high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs)
   validate the equivalence of the two optimization setups, and the
   efficacy of the proposed DLMP through QP for congestion management.},

Abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging irregularities have a massive effect on
   the distribution system. In recent years, research has focused on how to
   address the issue of large-scale charging and discharging of EVs while
   ensuring the grid's security. Distribution network operators should
   choose places where EV charging is practicable in terms of environmental
   and financial benefits. To establish how to best charge and discharge
   EVs in the distribution network, first comprehend and then determine the
   optimal position of EV parking lots in the distribution network. In this
   article, to solve this optimization problem, first the mathematical
   model of the problem is built, and then - according to the nonlinear
   features of the proposed optimization model - the second-order cone
   method is used to find the optimal solution with high accuracy and
   speed. The objective functions can accomplish more realistic objectives
   like lowering losses and minimizing voltage deviation changes with the
   charging and discharging time control technique, in addition to
   optimizing the technical requirements of the distribution network. The
   two-point estimation method of Hang is used to describe the uncertainty
   in the loads and capacities of solar sources in the random state, and
   optimization is applied to the IEEE 33-bus distribution system. The
   obtained results reveal that the proposed method not only meets the
   charging and discharging requirements of large-scale EVs, but also
   ensures the stability of the power grid, demonstrating the effectiveness

Abstract = {Due to the large number of electric vehicles (EVs) connected to the
   distribution network of residential areas (RAs), community charging has
   become a major constraint. The planning of the distribution network in
   RAs needs to consider the orderly charging load of EVs. In the current
   study, an orderly charging planning method for the charging posts and
   distribution network of RAs was proposed. First, a charging load
   forecasting model based on the travel characteristics, charging time,
   and ownership of EVs in RAs was established. Then, a hierarchical
   orderly charging optimization method, including a distribution network
   layer and EV access node layer, was devised. The upper layer optimizes
   the distribution network. The objective function is the minimum variance
   of the overall load in the RA and the constraint conditions satisfy the
   overall charging load demand and the capacity of the distributed
   network. The lower layer optimizes the EV access nodes. The objective
   function is the minimum variance of the node access load, and the
   constraint conditions are to meet the regional charging load demand and
   the optimal power balance demand transmitted from the upper layer to the
   lower layer. A nonlinear optimization algorithm is employed to solve
   these objective functions. An IEEE 33 node example was used to obtain
   the orderly charging power load curves for weekdays and weekends in RAs,
   and the simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed

   decades to make electric vehicles a substitute for conventional
   transportation systems with the same reliability. The merit for EV

   the density and geographical distribution of charging stations, the
   charging speed and capacity, the utilization rates, the availability of
   alternative charging options (e.g., fast charging, slow charging), and
   the integration of optimization technologies for optimal energy

   working on the challenges related to their mass adoption in current

Title = {An Effective Strategy for Achieving Economic Reliability by Optimal
   Coordination of Hybrid Thermal-Wind-EV System in a Deregulated System},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},

Abstract = {This paper describes an effective operating strategy for electric
   vehicles (EVs) in a hybrid facility that leverages renewable energy
   sources. The method is to enhance the profit of the wind-thermal-EV
   hybrid plant while maintaining the grid frequency (fPG) and energy level
   of the EV battery storage system. In a renewable-associated power
   network, renewable energy producers must submit power supply proposals
   to the system operator at least one day before operations begin. The
   market managers then combine the power plans for the next several days
   based on bids from both power providers and distributors. However, due
   to the unpredictable nature of renewable resources, the electrical
   system cannot exactly adhere to the predefined power supply criteria.
   When true and estimated renewable power generation diverges, the
   electrical system may experience an excess or shortage of electricity.
   If there is a disparity between true and estimated wind power (TWP,
   EWP), the EV plant operates to minimize this variation. This lowers the
   costs associated with the discrepancy between actual and projected wind
   speeds (TWS, EWS). The proposed method effectively reduces the
   uncertainty associated with wind generation while being economically
   feasible, which is especially important in a deregulated power market.
   This study proposes four separate energy levels for an EV battery
   storage system (EEV,max, EEV,opt, EEV,low, and EEV,min) to increase
   system profit and revenue, which is unique to this work. The optimum
   operating of these EV battery energy levels is determined by the present
   electric grid frequency and the condition of TWP and EWP. The proposed
   approach is tested on a modified IEEE 30 bus system and compared to an
   existing strategy to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority. The
   entire work was completed using the optimization technique called
   sequential quadratic programming (SQP).},

Abstract = {With the rapid increasing number of on-road Electric Vehicles (EVs),
   properly planning the deployment of EV Charging Stations (CSs) in
   highway systems become an urgent problem in modern energy-transportation
   coupling systems. This paper proposes a hierarchical CS planning
   framework for highway systems by considering the integration of Mobile
   Energy Storage Vehicles (MESVs) and traffic flow patterns of the highway
   system in working days and holidays. In the upper level of the
   framework, an optimization model is formulated to determine the number
   and locations of CSs, and the configuration of MESVs. Based on these
   planning results, in the lower level, an operational planning model is
   established to optimize the charging power of the EVs in the CSs and the
   operation strategy of the MESVs. The outputs of the lower-level model
   are fed back to the upper level to update the planning result. This
   process iteratively proceeds until convergence. Business models are
   established for the MESVs in working days and holidays separately to
   accommodate the CSs in serving the EV charging demand of the highway and
   support the interaction between the CSs and the grid. Numerical
   simulation based on the real-world data is conducted to validate the

Abstract = {The increasing integration of electric vehicles (EVs) is adding higher

   study-between 0\% and 100\% of customers can simultaneously charge their

Abstract = {The aggressive goal of having a 100\% renewable energy system requires
   preparing an appropriate infrastructure for deploying as much
   distributed generation (DG) as possible into the electricity network.
   This article aims at proposing a new framework to maximize the hosting

   framework provides a suitable and interactive environment for the
   electricity market, distribution company (DISCO), electric vehicle (EV)
   aggregator, and rival DISCOs to increase the HC. The problem is modeled
   via a bilevel conditional-value-at-risk-constrained stochastic
   programming approach. The DISCO, in the upper level (UL), tries to
   maximize the HC and minimize the operating costs while interacting with
   a passive electricity market and an EV aggregator. The aggregator, in
   the lower level, aims to maximize their profit by interacting with the
   primary DISCO in the UL and the rival DISCO, to satisfy the EV owners.
   The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are used to recast the model into an
   equivalent single level. The proposed framework is tested on a 33-node

Title = {Stochastic MILP Model for Merging EV Charging Stations with Active
   Distribution System Expansion Planning by considering Uncertainties},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 23},
Abstract = {Radial Power Distribution Networks (PDNs) often suffer from limited
   reliability, flexibility, and efficiency, leading to service
   interruptions. Planning for radial PDNs is essential to enhance
   redundancy resilience, reduce disruptions, and improve overall
   efficiency. However, traditional PDN planning methods have become
   obsolete due to the proliferation of Distributed Generation (DG)
   resources and energy storage systems. Additionally, the rise of Electric
   Vehicles (EVs) demands sophisticated charging infrastructure planning.
   This article presents a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model
   for joint expansion planning of PDN and Electric Vehicle Charging
   Stations (EVCSs). The model takes into account the construction or
   reinforcement of substations and circuits, along with the integration of
   EVs, the installation of DGs, and the placement of capacitor banks, all
   regarded as traditional conventional expansion options alternatives. To
   address uncertainties associated with DG generation, conventional loads,
   and EV demand, our model identifies optimal installation and asset
   locations. We formulate this as a stochastic scenario-based program with
   chance constraints for Power Distribution Network Expansion Planning
   (PDNEP), minimizing investment, operational, and energy loss cost costs
   over a planning horizon. Through two deterministic and stochastic
   approaches, encompassing six case studies on an 18-node test system, we
   evaluate the effectiveness of our model. Results are further validated
   on a 54-node system, confirming the model's robustness. Notably, the
   numerical findings underscore the substantial cost reduction achieved by
   including EVCSs in the stochastic expansion planning approach,
   demonstrating its cost-effectiveness. In case study I, where all EVs
   charge at home during peak hours, it's the worst case for the PDN. The
   54-node system, more complex, demands longer computational time. In the
   18-node system, costs improve from 9.97\% (case study II) to 3.96\%
   (case study VI) versus the worst-case (case I). In the 54-node system,
   improvements range from 10.47\% (case study II) to 1.40\% (case study
   VI). As a result, In comparative analyses against deterministic and
   stochastic approaches, our model consistently outperforms in diverse
   test case studies. The proposed model's adaptability to address
   uncertainties underscores its suitability for solving the PDNEP problem
   in PND.},

Abstract = {The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution
   systems requires efficient charging load management techniques for
   delivering high-quality power to consumers. In this paper, we proposed a
   strategic planning approach for distribution systems integrated with EV
   charging stations, employing fuzzy Pareto optimality to enhance system
   performance and minimize carbon emissions. Our approach involves a fuzzy
   Pareto heuristic network reconfiguration to minimize real power loss and
   improve voltage profiles. Additionally, Time of Use (ToU) pricing-based
   EV charging load scheduling is developed to minimize the annual energy
   cost. These objectives aim to improve minimum node voltage, reduce power
   losses, and maintain branch current constraints. To simulate the impact
   of EV charging loads, we aggregate residential, commercial, and
   industrial loads, along with EV charging loads at charging stations
   based on customer choice time and ToU pricing methods. The proposed
   reconfiguration approach is tested on 33 and 69-bus distribution systems
   with integrated EV charging stations, distributed generations (DGs), and
   shunt capacitors (SCs). The simulation results demonstrate the
   ad-vantages of the reconfiguration algorithm in enhancing the
   performance of the distribution network in the presence of EV loads.
   Furthermore, we compare ToU pricing-based EV charging time zones with
   customer comfort-based EV charging, showcasing the advantages of the
   former in reducing emissions through real power loss reduction. Overall,
   our strategic planning approach not only improves distribution system
   performance but also offers economic benefits while minimizing carbon
   dioxide emissions.},

Abstract = {In this study, the energy management and switching control of plug-in
   hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in a hybrid smart micro-grid system was
   designed. The charging station in this research consists of real market
   PHEVs of different companies with different sizes. The rate of charging
   of PHEVs is managed via switching control to receive maximum benefits
   from renewable energy sources and reduce the consumption of electricity
   from the grid. To support the optimum utilization of sustainable power,
   charging time and network stability, seven scenarios were developed for
   different interaction among the proposed micro-grid system and PHEVs.
   The proposed hybrid smart micro-grid system consists of three renewable
   energy sources: photovoltaic (PV) array controlled via an intelligent
   fuzzy control maximum power point subsystem, a fuel cell stack and a
   microturbine set controlled by proportional integral
   differential/proportional integral subsystems. A hybrid energy storage
   system (super-capacitor, battery storage bank and hydrogen) and
   residential load are also included in the proposed architecture. The
   hybrid smart micro-grid system is checked in terms of voltage
   regulation, frequency deviation and total harmonic distortion (THD). It
   was found that these are in limits according to the international
   standards. The simulations verify the feasibility of the proposed system
   and fulfill the requirement of vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle

Abstract = {Integrating electric vehicles (EVs), residential PVs, and energy storage
   systems (ESSs) into low-voltage distribution networks poses significant
   challenges, particularly regarding grid capacity and efficiency. This
   study addresses these challenges by developing distributed energy
   management systems for the EVs and the ESSs, and sizing approaches for
   the PVs and the ESSs, by enabling multi-agent systems and fuzzy
   cognitive maps. The optimization framework simultaneously considers six
   key objective functions which studied separately or in limited
   combinations: (i) ESS installation cost, (ii) low-voltage network
   operation parameters, (iii) active power losses, (iv) EV charging times,
   (v) total energy costs, and (vi) excess energy from PV systems. Using
   environmental conditions and energy purchase costs to define two
   regions, Heraklion, Greece, and Berlin, Germany, under varying EV
   integration rates, the proposed methodology enables the IEEE European
   Low Voltage feeder as a case study and Euclidean distance is used to
   identify optimal solutions from the Pareto frontiers. Results show that
   the integration of the distributed ESS contributes to a significant
   reduction in network's energy consumption, while reduced solar
   irradiance in Berlin leads to different cost and operational patterns.
   Heraklion generally achieves better cost efficiency due to higher solar
   irradiance. Additionally, network operational parameters are
   significantly improved, and energy costs for residences are reduced up
   to 39\%.},

Abstract = {Optimisation of cost and load flattening for a distribution network is
   attempted in this work. The objective function is described in terms of
   energy cost,CO emissions, real power losses, and load flattening. The
   solution is envisaged in tes of hourly scheduling of distributed
   generations (DGs), distributed battery energy storage systems (D-BESSs),
   and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). An investigation in the
   refoulation of the cost of energy is carried out to eliminate the
   solutions involving excessive charging and discharging of BESSs/D-BESSs
   and PHEVs. It is demonstrated that simultaneous optimisation of cost, C
   O\_CO emissions, real power losses, and load flattening cannot be
   effectively solved as a weighted sum objective function. An
   \textbackslash{}varepsilon epsilon-constraint method is applied to
   obtain the optimal scheduling to achieve cost optimisation, load
   flattening, and minimisation of C O\_CO emissions from the utility point
   of view. A case of decentralised multi-agent optimisation problem is
   also foulated and compared. It is observed that the combination of the
   scheduling of DGs, BESSs/D-BESSs, grid-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-grid can
   successfully be used to significantly reduce the system peak demand
   along with system cost, losses and CO2 emissions.},

Abstract = {The orderly charge and discharge scheduling of Electric Vehicles (EVs)
   plays an increasingly important role in safe operation of the
   distribution network. Currently, there exists the problem that some
   charging station agents do not pay attention to the difference between
   the charging information of EVs and the charging demand of users, and
   treat the charge and discharge scheduling of EVs undifferentiated, which
   results in users' dissatisfaction. This paper presents a three-stage
   optimization of charging scheduling of EVs, which is based on the
   electricity price to guide charging selection of users and the
   continuous charging and discharging of EVs while scheduling. In first
   stage, the agents provide different charging modes for users to choose
   from, a charging selection model for users based on EV charging
   information and the time-of-use (TOU) electricity price is established.
   The arrival and departure time of EVs, state-of-charge (SOC) and TOU
   electricity price are all factors that affect users' charging selection.
   Differential group dispatching of EVs with different charging modes to
   realize the requirements of the power grid and users. In second stage,
   based on the charging selection of users and the charging information of
   EVs, the charging load in different periods can be predicted, which can
   guide the power purchase for charging agents. The third stage is the
   integrated charging scheduling of EVs. EVs dispatching is based on the
   priority, which takes the charge-discharge switching times of EVs into
   account. The model takes the maximum income of the charging agents as
   the objective and takes the requirements of the power grid and users as
   the constraints. Modified adaptive step size fruit fly optimization
   algorithm (MASSFOA) is utilized to optimize the TOU electricity price,
   and the optimized TOU electricity price is used to guide EV user's
   charging selection. The results of simulation analysis show that the
   proposed strategy can reduce the peak-to-valley difference of the load
   curve, improve the continuous charging and discharging of EVs, and
   increase the income of charging station agents.},

Abstract = {The advent of distributed energy resources (DERs), which include small
   conventional and renewable generation units, energy storage, and
   flexible loads in distribution network needs distributed coordination
   for effective management. In this paper, a stochastic transactive
   management framework is proposed to minimize overall cost and avoid
   network constraints violation at the distribution network level. This
   framework includes day-ahead scheduling of electric vehicles and air
   conditioning loads under demand response aggregators (DRAs), and DERs
   under distributed generation owners (DGOs) into day-ahead wholesale
   market in a network managed by a distribution network operator (DNO). An
   agent called distribution independent system operator (DISO) is
   responsible for coordination among DRAs, DGOs, and DNO. A heuristic
   step-size update approach is proposed to calculate the Lagrange
   multiplier iteratively and improve the convergence speed. This framework
   is modeled as a quadratic constraint programming (QCP) problem and
   solved using the GAMS solver. Simulation results on a modified 33-bus
   system with considerable penetration of loads and DERs, shows that the
   suggested framework can efficiently reduce the iterations to converge
   and returns an optimal schedule. And demonstrate the effect of network

Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are a promising solution to urban environmental
   challenges, but their unplanned growth could strain both the road and
   electric networks. To address this issue, this paper introduces the
   Combined Model of Road Transport and Electric Distribution Network
   (CoRTED), a framework for strategically deploying EV charging stations
   considering the dynamics of both networks. The CoRTED model minimizes EV
   user travel costs, power loss, and voltage deviation. The model employs
   a bi-level optimization approach with PSO-DS algorithm for station
   deployment and combined convex optimization (CCO) for traffic network
   equilibrium. Grid economic operation is formulated as AC OPF and solved
   using a primal-dual interior point method. Validation is performed using
   a modified Nguyen-Dupius RTN and IEEE 33 bus EDN, demonstrating CoRTED's
   effectiveness in integrated network planning for EV infrastructure. Due
   to the increase in power demand by EVs, the loss and voltage deviation
   are increased to 4.679 MW and 24.23\%, respectively. The proposed model
   reduces the losses and voltage deviation by 4.487 MW and 1.24\%. Also,
   the total travel cost on the traffic network is reduced by 1.9\% as the

   Considering Large-Scale Electric Vehicles Based on NSGAII-NDAX Algorithm},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {97259-97273},
Abstract = {With the rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) ownership, the problem of
   increased peak loads on distribution networks due to large-scale EV
   integration needs to be addressed. This study proposes an active
   distribution network multi-objective optimization scheduling method. It
   takes into account the charging demands of large-scale EVs and aims to
   minimize distribution network operating costs, reduce net load variance,
   and maximize the photovoltaic (PV) consumption rate. First, the Monte
   Carlo sampling method is used to analyze the charging load demands of a
   large number of EVs. Next, we construct a multi-objective optimization
   scheduling model for the active distribution network. This model
   integrates the charging demands of EVs with the operating constraints of
   the distribution network. To tackle the multi-objective optimization
   problem, we propose the NSGAII-NDAX algorithm. Additionally, we employ a
   fuzzy theory-based method to select the Pareto optimal solution set,
   addressing the challenge of decision-making complexity posed by the
   large size and information-rich content of the optimal solution set.
   Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method in the comparative
   analysis of multiple scenarios is verified by an improved IEEE 33-node
   example. The experimental results show that the proposed model and
   method can effectively utilize EV charging load optimization to reduce
   the peak-to-valley difference in the system load while ensuring the
   system's economic operation and the maximum PV consumption rate.
   Compared with the other algorithms, the NSGAII-NDAX algorithm has
   stronger optimization ability and can better handle multi-objective
   optimization problems.},

Title = {A Planning Model for an Electric Vehicle Aggregator Providing Ancillary
   Services to an Unbalanced Distribution Network Considering Contract
   Design},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {29035-29048},
Abstract = {Recent advancements in battery technology have made them more
   economically viable than ever before, making them suitable for various
   grid-scale applications. Due to their rapid response, batteries are
   attractive for providing ancillary services (AS), such as frequency
   regulation and reserve services, to the bulk power grid. On the other
   hand, an electric vehicle (EV) is viewed as a moving battery;
   consequently, EVs are also suitable for those services. This research
   proposes a linear planning model for an Electric Vehicle Aggregator
   (EVA) within a distribution network (DN) to offer Ancillary Services
   (AS) to the bulk power grid. The model takes into account contract
   design by identifying optimal incentives or charging tariffs that
   Electric Vehicle (EV) owners would be willing to pay the EVA for
   charging their vehicles. Additionally, the model takes into account the
   size of the electric vehicle (EV) fleet as a crucial planning factor for
   EV aggregation that depends on the energy pricing set by the EVA. The
   proposed model is developed to maximize the overall profit of bidding
   capacities in the energy and AS markets while supporting the operation
   of an unbalanced DN by maintaining the DN limits. Simulation results and
   sensitivity analyses on the model have been carried out to support the
   investment model and investigate the change in the optimal solution
   across different case studies. Simulations show that the optimal
   charging tariff (beta) is (0.02 \$/kWh)when considering scenarios where
   Distribution Network (DN) limits, such as thermal and voltage
   constraints, are ignored for all EV participation versus beta relations.
   When including the DN, the optimal payoffs vary based on the
   relationship between the charging tariff and the number of participating
   EVs.},

Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are entering thousands of households, as they
   contribute to sustainable energy development and effectively alleviate
   environmental degradation. However, the unregulated charging behavior of
   EVs has a significant impact on the power quality of the distribution
   network, accompanied by integration with renewable energy sources, which
   puts double pressure on the grid. To tackle these problems, this paper
   proposes a two-stage collaborative optimization strategy for EV charging
   scheduling with photovoltaic (PV) system. In the upper-stage
   optimization, a Variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is
   presented to learn the real EV charging event distribution, and the
   generated charging events are used to achieve the optimization of the
   on-site PV system scale. In the lower-stage optimization, using the
   optimal PV system scale obtained from the upper-stage optimization to
   calibrate the output power, a collaborative optimization of EV charging
   scheduling and PV system using the Lagrange multiplier method is
   proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is analyzed and
   validated using real-world, full-day charging data collected from
   charging facilities at the parking lots of Caltech campus. Experimental
   results show that the optimized charging scheduling strategy can reduce
   the charging cost, alleviate the peak-to-valley difference of the grid,

Abstract = {The significant expansion of Electric Vehicles (EV) creates an uncertain
   load demand that may pose many challenges to conventional planning
   methods, especially at the distribution network level. The development
   of EV technology requires charging infrastructure, which must be
   considered in the Distribution System Expansion Planning (DSEP). Due to
   the presence of EV and the load they impose on the distribution system,
   the planning of EV charging stations is done simultaneously with the
   DSEP so that the system operator can properly consider the technical
   constraints of the network and operational constraints. This paper
   presents a bi-level model for EV charging station expansion planning.
   The main purpose of the first level problem is expansion planning of
   charging stations and distribution system. But the charging stations are
   mostly built by a merchant investor, and they do so when it is
   profitable and has a reasonable risk. Therefore, the merchant investor
   should be encouraged to build a charging station in the planned areas.
   For this reason, in the second level problem, the profitability of the
   charging station and its risk are examined. To solve this problem,
   genetic algorithm (GA) has been used. Finally, to test the proposed
   model, the simulation was performed on a modified 69-bus IEEE network.},

Abstract = {Current trends suggest that electrical vehicle (EV) is a promising

   This study presents optimal planning of FCSs and DGs with the account of
   the present and future increase in EV population. A multi-objective
   optimisation problem is formulated for optimal planning of FCSs and DGs
   with the objective of minimising the voltage deviation, distribution

Abstract = {Smart grid constrained optimal control is a complex issue due to the
   constant growth of grid complexity and the large volume of data
   available as input to smart device control. In this context, traditional
   centralized control paradigms may suffer in terms of the timeliness of
   optimization results due to the volume of data to be processed and the
   delayed asynchronous nature of the data transmission. To address these
   limits of centralized control, this paper presents a coordinated,
   distributed algorithm based on distributed, local controllers and a
   central coordinator for exchanging summarized global state information.
   The proposed model for exchanging global state information is resistant
   to fluctuations caused by the inherent interdependence between local
   controllers, and is robust to delays in information exchange. In
   addition, the algorithm features iterative refinement of local state
   estimations that is able to improve local controller ability to operate
   within network constraints. Application of the proposed coordinated,
   distributed algorithm through simulation shows its effectiveness in
   optimizing a global goal within a complex distribution system operating
   under constraints, while ensuring network operation stability under
   varying levels of information exchange delay, and with a range of
   network sizes.},

Abstract = {With the proposal of China's ``carbon peak{''} strategy, the large-scale
   promotion of electric vehicles has become a trend. The
   charging-swapping-storage integrated station (CSSIS) will also become an
   effective technical means to achieve orderly charging and an excellent
   resource to participate in the operation and regulation of the power
   grid. This paper establishes a two-level active and reactive joint
   optimization model for active distribution network(ADN) include CSSIS.
   The outer layer optimization emphasizes the overall active/reactive
   power output plan of CSSIS from the global perspective of AND, in order
   to improve the safety and economy of ADN operation and reduce charging
   cost of electric vehicles. The internal optimization focuses on the
   specific output plan within CSSIS, achieving complementarity between
   regulatory resources, and suppressing fluctuations in load power and
   node voltage. In order to reduce the adjustment pressure of dynamic
   power supply in real-time optimization, a robust optimization method was
   adopted in the day-ahead optimization, which improved the system's
   ability to handle uncertain factors and achieved the ``friendliness{''}
   of CSSIS connecting to ADN. Finally, the IEEE33 node and 118 node
   distribution systems were used as examples for validation and analysis,
   and the results showed that the proposed model and method have good
   performance in achieving AND multi-time scale active and reactive power
   joint optimization.},

Abstract = {Environmental concerns of using fossil fuel vehicles and recent
   developments in electric vehicle (EV) technology have attracted the
   attention of the international community to use EVs. A design strategy
   is proposed by simultaneously considering a distribution network and an
   urban transportation network, that maximises drivers' travel comfort in
   urban trips and reduces costs of both charging station (CS) installation
   and losses. The proposed strategy meets various constraints such as,
   properly locating CSs in the city, considering traffic volume, taking
   the shortest route, reducing charging waiting time, limits of bus
   voltages, power balance, the permissible loading of lines. The travel
   comfort index corresponds to a situation in which the driver does not
   experience a depleted battery and successfully finish the trip. Since
   the movement of vehicles over the course of a day does not follow any
   particular pattern, unscented transformation is used to investigate the
   uncertainty in different probabilistic parameters of EVs. Moreover, by
   clustering the locations of EVs, the optimal locations of EV CSs are
   determined over the course of the day (in several time steps) using a
   multi-objective function based on a GA. The simulation results of the
   sample urban transportation and distribution networks confirm the

Abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging infrastructure is necessary to
   accommodate the rapid increase in PEV penetration rate. Capacity
   planning of PEV charging infrastructure (EVCI) must ensure not only a
   satisfactory charging service for PEV users but also a reliable
   operation of the power grid. In this paper, we propose a
   quality-of-service (QoS) aware capacity planning of EVCI. In particular,
   the proposed framework accounts for the link between the charging QoS
   and the power distribution network (PDN) capability. Towards this end,
   we firstly optimize charging facility sizes to achieve a targeted QoS
   level. Then, we minimize the integration cost for the PDN by attaining
   the most cost-effective allocation of the energy storage systems (ESSs)
   and/or upgrading the PDN substation and feeders. Additionally, we
   capture the correlation between the occupation levels of neighboring
   charging facilities and the blocked PEV user behaviors. We model the
   EVCI as a queuing network with finite capacity, and utilize the
   non-stationary queuing models to study the temporal variability of the
   PEV charging demand. A network of charging facilities is used to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Abstract = {The capability of onboard bidirectional chargers to deliver both real

   candidates for the voltage regulation in the distribution network
   considering the higher R/X ratio of distribution lines. This article
   proposes a distributed voltage regulation scheme for dominantly
   resistive distribution networks through coordinated EV
   charging/discharging. In the optimal planning stage, the maximal profit
   of each EV user for the regulation provision is guaranteed, while the
   driving need can be satisfied. An optimal charging model is proposed to
   plan the total available P and Q, and a parameter ``involvement
   level{''} is introduced for the fair pricing of participating EV users.
   In the regulation stage, an adaptive voltage sensitivity coefficient is
   developed to estimate the amount of required power for voltage
   regulation. A novel parallel consensus sharing strategy is designed so
   that the local power dispatch decision can be made by each EV through
   information sharing between neighboring buses. The backup support from
   the local energy storage system (ESS) can be activated under the
   emergency scenario due to communication failure and insufficient EV

Abstract = {After large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) are connected to the
   residential distribution network, community charging has become one of
   the main bottlenecks at present, especially in old residential areas.
   Therefore, the current residential distribution network's ability to
   accept charging load and when and how the distribution network needs to

   characteristics of the EVs' charging load of residential areas on a
   typical day and the size of the target annual charging load, this paper
   analyzes the acceptance capacity of the charging load of the

   charging load characteristics, the charging time of EVs, the voltage of
   each node of the distribution network, the line capacity, the
   transformation capacity of the distribution station as constraints, and
   the maximum capacity of the residential distribution network to accept
   the charging load as the objective function, the charging load capacity
   of the residential distribution network is analyzed. The particle swarm
   optimization algorithm is employed to solve the optimized mathematical
   model. The simulation uses an actual residential distribution network as

Abstract = {Uncertainties associated with large-scale deployment of electric

   network expansion planning (DNEP). This paper proposes an optimal
   planning method for EV charging stations (EVCS) and distribution systems

   entailing PV-grid-EV transactions, which enables EVCS and PV prosumers
   to trade energy to make profits while complying with grid securities. It
   offers a cost-effective operational alternative to long-term planning,
   which would otherwise result in PV curtailment or unnecessary DNEP. The
   transactive market operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis and is cleared
   via a decentralized algorithm to protect privacy and enable autonomous

   quantifying its impact on adhering to security constraints from both
   long-term and short-term perspectives. Considering EV users' charging

Abstract = {One of the industries that use fossil fuels most frequently worldwide is
   transportation. Therefore, electrifying the transportation system, such
   as the creation of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), has become essential
   to reducing the effects of carbon dioxide emissions and using less
   traditional energy supplies that are not ecologically friendly. PEV
   deployment must be flawless, necessitating a well-developed charging
   infrastructure. The best location for fast charging stations (FCSs) is a
   crucial issue. As a result, this article offers a practical method for
   choosing the best site for FCSs using the east delta network (EDN). When
   transportation is made electric, the infrastructure of the electrical
   distribution network may also need to be changed. Therefore, when
   adopting FCSs, three factors need to be considered: actual power loss,
   reactive power loss, and investment cost. The energy demand from the
   electrical grid is also increased by including FCSs in the power
   distribution network. To lessen the impact of FCSs on the system, this
   research report suggests integrating photovoltaic distributed generation
   (PVDG) at certain places in the distribution network. Consequently, the
   system becomes dependable and self-sustaining. After deploying the FCSs
   and PVDGs, the distribution system's dependability is also examined. Six
   case studies (CS) have also been suggested for deploying FCSs with or
   without DG integration. As a result, the CS-6's active power loss

Abstract = {The planning of the transmission network is an issue that, over the
   years, has received much attention, particularly due to the impact that
   this infrastructure has on the safe and reliable functioning of
   electrical systems. The search for solutions addressing climate change
   has led to several changes in the functioning of electrical systems,
   particularly concerning the increasing integration of renewable
   electricity production. However, in recent years, changes in the load
   side of the electrical system have also emerged. In particular, electric
   mobility has been developing, and a high penetration of electric
   vehicles (EVs) is expected in near future. This consumption is supplied
   by the distribution system but will impact the transmission network.
   Naturally, the amount of energy used by EVs is subject to uncertainties,
   which makes the problem complex. Those uncertainties cannot be easily
   modeled using statistical distributions because of the reduced history
   of available information. The transmission system operator (TSO) needs
   an efficient tool to analyze the adequacy of the transmission network to
   supply the distribution networks with high penetration of EVs. In this
   paper, a methodology based on symmetric/constrained fuzzy power flow is
   proposed to find the optimal investment policy at the transmission level
   while satisfying the technical constraints. The concept of dual
   variables provided by Lagrange multipliers, the natural result of the
   nonlinear optimization problem, is used to obtain the most promising
   reinforcement options considering the actual structure of the

Abstract = {This paper presents a two-level transactive energy market framework,
   that enables energy trading among electric vehicle charging stations
   (EVCSs). At the lower level, the discharging capability of EVs and
   on-site PV generation are leveraged by individual EVCS for participating
   in the transactive trading with their peers. Once the lower-level
   trading is completed, EVCSs trade energy at the upper level through the
   power grid network managed by the distribution system operator (DSO).
   The upper-level market is cleared while satisfying the power
   distribution network constraints. A cooperative game-based model is
   proposed to model the energy trading among EVCSs. To this end, the
   asymmetric Nash bargaining method is applied to allocate the grand
   coalition's payoff to each EVCS at the upper-level market, while a
   weighted proportional allocation method is used to allocate individual
   EVCS's payoff to its respective EVs at the lower-level market. The
   upper-level market formulation is further decomposed into two
   subproblems representing an energy scheduling and trading subproblem
   which maximizes EVCS payoffs, and a bargaining subproblem which
   allocates EVCS payoffs. The effectiveness of the proposed framework for
   incentivizing transactive trades among EVs and EVCSs is validated in
   case studies.},

Title = {Integration of smart grid technologies in stochastic multi-objective
   unit commitment: An economic emission analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {565-590},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a stochastic multi-objective unit commitment (SMOUC)
   problem incorporating smart grid technologies (SGTs), namely, plug-in
   electric vehicles (PEVs), demand response programs (DRPs), compressed
   air energy storage (CAES) units, and renewable distributed generations
   (DGs). An economic emission analysis of the proposed SMOUC problem with
   the SGTs is carried out to minimize the total expected operation cost
   and emission using a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method.
   A two-stage stochastic programming method is used for dealing with the
   uncertain nature of power generation from the renewable DGs.
   Lexicographic optimization in combination with hybrid augmented-weighted
   c-constraint method are employed to obtain Pareto optimal solutions of
   the SMOUC problem, and a fuzzy decision making is applied to select the
   most preferred non-dominated solution. Besides, mathematical modeling of
   responsive loads can help the independent system operator (ISO) to use a
   conservative and reliable model to have lower error in load curve
   characteristic estimation, such as variation in peak load. In this
   regard, this paper also contributes to the existing body of knowledge by
   developing linear and nonlinear economic models of price responsive
   loads for time-based DRPs (TBDRPs), as well as voluntary and mandatory
   incentive-based DRPs (IBDRPs) based on the customer's behavior (CB)
   concept and price ratio (PR) parameter. Also, new mathematical indices
   are proposed to choose the most conservative and reliable economic model
   of price responsive loads. Moreover, different widely used DRPs are
   analyzed and prioritized using the strategy success index (SSI) from the
   ISO viewpoint to determine the most effective DRP which has more
   coordination with the SGTs. The proposed MILP-based SMOUC problem with
   integrated SGTs, is applied to IEEE 10-unit test system and is
   implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) environment.
   Simulation analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating SGTs
   into the proposed SMOUC problem from the economic, environmental, and
   technical points of view.},

Title = {EV Parking Lots for Flexible Energy Sourcing},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {38770-38782},
Abstract = {Energy storage is inherently a flexible asset that can be used to reduce
   renewable energy curtailment and the congestion at its host network,
   enhance system resilience, and provide ancillary services at peak times.
   But the cost of technology still hampers the large-scale adoption of
   storage in power distribution networks. With EV parking lots included in
   its asset portfolio, a city can take advantage of the power stored in
   the parked EVs without major capital investments. In this article, we
   formulate the operation of an EV parking lot from the viewpoint of its
   owner (i.e., a city or a private entity). The lot works as a market
   aggregator with operational uncertainties stemming from: (i) random
   arrival and departure of vehicles, (ii) the SoC of EV batteries at the
   times of arrival and departure, and (iii) willingness of EV owners to
   participate. The risks from these uncertainties and market prices of
   ancillary services impact the bottom line of the lot owner's revenue.
   For EV owners the excessive up and down cycles of battery is offset by
   discount offered by the lot owner. We provide an illustrative example
   and a roadmap to extend this model to take the holistic view of a power
   distribution network.},

Abstract = {Shared electric vehicle (EV) is an emerging component across
   interdependent power and transportation networks that affect economic,
   environmental and societal benefits. Studies on how to collaboratively
   enable the optimal planning of these interacted networks is less
   explored. In this work, a joint distribution network expansion planning
   framework integrated with a shared EV charging station is proposed. One
   of the objectives is to minimise overall investment cost considering
   operational waiting cost of shared EV charging service and power loss,
   while the other aims to maximise the utilisation of charging
   infrastructures. To overcome the difficulties in solving the
   multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear problem, Tchebycheff
   decomposition based evolutionary algorithm is modified to find the
   Pareto front showing the trade-offs between goals above. Besides,
   stochastic traffic assignment model is used to obtain traffic
   distribution and travel demand. The final optimal solution is decided by
   the fuzzy satisficing method. The performance of the proposed approach
   is evaluated on a 54-node test system. Sensitivity analysis is performed
   to assess the impact of key parameters from the perspectives of
   transportation and distribution network sectors. The numerical results
   demonstrate the capability and feasibility of the proposed method.},

   Grid Performance and Customer Satisfaction},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Advancements in technology and awareness of energy conservation and
   environmental protection have increased the adoption rate of electric
   vehicles (EVs). The rapidly increasing adoption of EVs may affect grid
   operation adversely. However, the increased integration of EVs, if
   managed appropriately, can positively impact the performance of the
   electrical network in terms of power losses, voltage deviations and
   transformer overloads. This paper presents a two-stage multi-agent-based
   scheme for the coordinated charging scheduling of EVs. The first stage
   uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) at the distribution network
   operator (DNO) level to determine the optimal power allocation among the
   participating EV aggregator agents to minimize power losses and voltage
   deviations, whereas the second stage at the EV aggregator agents level
   employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to align the charging activities to
   achieve customers' charging satisfaction in terms of minimum charging
   cost and waiting time. The proposed method is implemented on the IEEE-33
   bus network connected with low-voltage nodes. The coordinated charging
   plan is executed with the time of use (ToU) and real-time pricing (RTP)
   schemes, considering EVs' random arrival and departure with two
   penetration levels. The simulations show promising results in terms of
   network performance and overall customer charging satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The importance of using clean energy in electrical energy generation and
   transportation network planning has recently increased due to carbon
   footprint rising. In this direction, the use of electric vehicles (EV),
   known as ultra-low carbon emission vehicles, has become widespread in
   addition to renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind and photovoltaic
   (PV) power generations. The trend of EVs to be preferred the primary
   means of transport has revealed the effects of charging an additional
   load on the grid. There is a need to create coordinated charging methods
   by considering the approaches for real-time charging models of EVs. In
   this paper, SOC-based EV coordinated charging was proposed for power
   management to prevent adverse effects including transformer overload,
   instantaneous peak loading and line overload in the existing
   distribution network. The proposed coordinated EV charging method was
   tested on the modified Roy Billinton test system (RBTS) Bus 2 network.
   AC 11 kW uncoordinated charging units have been respectively 123.76\%
   distribution transformer and 115.16\% distribution line overloading for
   500 EVs on the grid with 13,9\% diversity factor. However, these values
   that are 72.05\% of distribution transformer and 67.01\% of distribution
   grid overloading according to permittable level were decreased by the
   proposed coordinated charging method. Also, the state of charge (SOC)
   based coordinated method can increase 3.5\% rate the diversity factor of
   charging capacity at the charging station with PV and battery energy

Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {244},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In the context of the ``dual carbon{''} goal, the rapid growth of
   distributed new energy and electric vehicles (EV) has brought great
   challenges to the safe and economic operation of the distribution grid.
   In order to improve the economy and low carbon of distribution network
   planning, this paper proposes a low carbon planning method of flexible
   distribution network considering EV orderly charging and discharging.
   Firstly, a dynamic charging and discharging boundary aggregation model
   of EV cluster is constructed based on the EV individual power feasible
   domain model. Secondly, using the carbon emission flow theory as a tool,
   a two-layer low-carbon planning model of distribution network
   considering EV orderly charge and discharge is established. The upper
   layer plans the distribution network lines, two-way charging piles, and
   intelligent soft open point (SOP), while the lower layer optimizes EV
   charge and discharge strategy and user consumption strategy with the
   goal of minimum comprehensive operating cost. Then, the two-layer
   nonlinear model is transformed into a single-layer mixed- integer
   second-order cone programming model by means of upper-lower linkage,
   large M method and second- order cone relaxation, which is solved by
   commercial solvers. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the model
   are verified in the improved 33-node system.},

Title = {Active and Reactive Power Scheduling of Distribution System Based on
   Two-Stage Stochastic Optimization},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {With the large-scale integration of distributed resources into the
   distribution network, such as wind/solar power and electric vehicles
   (EVs), the uncertainties have rapidly increased in the operation
   optimization of the distribution network. In this context, it is of
   great practical interest to ensure the security and economic operation
   of the distribution network. This paper addresses this issue and makes
   the following contributions. Firstly, a two-stage stochastic rolling
   optimization framework for active-reactive power scheduling is
   established. In the first stage, it dispatches the active power of
   distributed resources. In the second stage, it optimizes the reactive
   power compensation based on the first-stage scheduling plan. Secondly,
   the simulation-based Rollout method is proposed to obtain the improved
   active power dispatching policy for cost optimization in the first
   stage. Meanwhile, the aggregated power of EVs can be determined based on
   the mobility and charging demand of EVs. Thirdly, based on the
   aggregated power of EVs, a scenario-based second-order cone programming
   is applied to perform the rolling optimization of reactive power
   compensation for voltage performance improvement in the second stage.
   The numerical results demonstrate that this method can effectively
   improve the economic operation of the distribution network while
   enhancing its operational security by leveraging the charging elasticity
   of EVs.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid method for network expansion planning for
   electric vehicle charging stations. The hybrid method is the combination
   of Eurasian Oystercatcher optimizer (EOO) and spiking neural network
   (SNN) approach and is usually referred as EOO-SNN approach. The major
   purpose of the work is to extend the optimal charging strategy for EVs,
   which includes the allocation of charging resources to decrease the
   charging costs, increase the charging efficiency, and decrease the
   impact on the power grid. The EOO is used to optimize various aspects,
   such as charging time, charging station placement, and network expansion
   planning. The ideal solution is predicted using the SNN. The approach
   also combined with smart grid technologies, such as demand response
   mechanisms and fuel cell integration with battery energy storage system,
   to optimize the energy system and ensure efficient and sustainable EV
   charging. The proposed method supports scalability/adaptability in EV
   charging systems, effective charging strategy formulation, and worldwide
   optimisation of charging infrastructure growth. The proposed method's
   effectiveness is then evaluated on the MATLAB platform and compared to
   other existing approaches. The efficacy of the proposed system is high

Abstract = {In the last decade, with the development of the electric vehicle
   industry and their acceptance in human societies, the participation plan
   of electric vehicles in supplying the load of the network has been taken
   into consideration. One of the requirements of this plan is the optimal
   location of the stations for these vehicles in the network so that they
   play an effective role in the operation of the network. In this regard,
   along with the construction of charging and discharging stations for
   electric vehicles, the construction of renewable sources in the network
   can play a complementary role for these stations. In this paper, the
   effect of using renewable resources as a supplement for smart charging
   stations and the placement of these stations to achieve technical and
   economic goals have been investigated. In order to manage the demand on
   the side of consumers and even out the load curve, the time of use
   mechanism as one of the demand response programs has been considered in
   this study. In this research, the improved nondominant sorting genetic
   algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, and the results of the
   proposed method are also compared with the conventional genetic and
   particle swarm optimization algorithms. All the simulations have been
   done in the MATLAB software and on the IEEE 33-bus network. Based on the
   obtained results, after the implementation of the proposed plan in the
   distribution network, the objective functions of the loss, voltage drop,
   and the total cost have been reduced by 13.6\%, 58.7\%, and 54.4\%,
   respectively, compared to the base conditions of the network.},

Abstract = {Environmental concerns and oil price volatility have created increased
   interest in smart grid green energy technologies such as photovoltaic
   (PV) arrays and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, these
   technologies have been found to have a significant impact on
   distribution networks in terms of secondary distribution transformer
   overloading and increased reverse power flow. Energy storage systems
   (ESSs) are thought to be an effective tool for mitigating these negative
   effects. The primary challenge in implementing ESS technology lies in
   the difficulty of determining the appropriate sizes and operating
   schedules for these units, given the uncertainties inherent in PV array
   production and PHEV demand. This paper presents a probabilistic sizing
   and scheduling methodology for ESSs to facilitate the integration of
   PHEVs and PV arrays in distribution networks, taking into account
   different sources of uncertainty present in the system. The technical
   and economic feasibility of the proposed design methodology has been
   validated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a variety of scenarios.

Abstract = {With the expansion of the scale of power grid and the increase of the
   number of microgrids, the energy interaction between microgrids using
   contact lines will greatly increase the computation of the superior
   dispatching center. Therefore, the contact lines between microgrids are
   cancelled, so that the microgrids can realize energy interaction through
   the distribution network. However, this method may lead to overload of
   distribution network connections while reducing the computation. Due to
   its good transfer characteristics, the addition of electric vehicles
   (EVs) can alleviate the contact line pressure and realize the load
   transfer of microgrids. On this basis, a grid dispatching model based on
   the participation of EVs in microgrid interaction is proposed. Contact
   lines between microgrids are replaced by EVs and 100\% transmission
   through the distribution network. The grid load is optimized with the
   goal of minimizing total cost, maximizing renewable energy utilization,
   and maximizing profit of each integrator. In the process of model
   optimization, aiming at the problem that the speed factor in the
   particle swarm optimization algorithm cannot take into account the
   optimal direction and the optimal step size, the adaptive time factor is
   added to establish a two-layer improved particle swarm optimization
   algorithm, which realizes the cooperative optimization of load and
   electricity price. The simulation results show that the total cost and
   underutilization of renewable energy of IEEE33-node system are reduced
   by 13.79\% and 67.85\%, compared with the traditional interaction mode,
   while they are reduced by 0.425\% and 6.11\% in IEEE43-node system.},

Title = {A day-ahead energy management strategy for electric vehicles in parking
   lots considering multi-scenario simulations and hydrogen storage system},
Journal = {IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article investigated the charge and discharge management structure
   of electric vehicles (EVs) in intelligent parking lots (IPLs). It seems
   that with the expansion of renewable energy sources (RESs) as clean
   energy and investigation of the effects of EVs on the operation and
   planning of future distribution networks around the way EVs exchange
   energy with each other and the upstream network operator, RESs such as
   solar and wind sources, along with hydrogen storage are essential.
   Therefore, a new stochastic multi-scenario approach for charge/discharge
   management of EVs parked in IPL was proposed, in which a newly developed
   model for the IPL with a hydrogen storage system (HSS) consisting of a
   fuel cell, an electrolyzer, and a hydrogen storage tank was presented.
   In the proposed model, the constraints of upstream network and power
   balance constraints, with the operating constraints related to the IPL,
   including EVs, renewable energy sources, and the hydrogen storage
   system, were formulated as the most important objectives of the
   optimization problem. The optimization algorithm, Competitive Swarm
   Optimizer (CSO), was formulated for implementation, and its results were
   compared with those of the PSO and GWO algorithms. The CSO must handle a
   variety of practical, large-scale optimization problems. Based on the
   obtained results, the excess energy purchased from the upstream network
   or renewable sources was used as hydrogen storage for consumption during
   peak hours. As expected, the technical constraints and financial goals
   of the system were met, and the proposed system was evaluated on a
   33-bus network. As the expected benefits will be the most beneficial
   with the presence of renewable sources, the final profit will be reduced
   by taking into account uncertainty for charge/discharge management in
   EVs such as the uncertainty of electric load, market price, wind
   turbine, and photovoltaic cell sources. Nonetheless, the profit obtained
   from renewable resources is preferable to losses resulting from the
   uncertainty of the system, and according to expectation, the performance
   of the system for managing the optimal charging and discharging of EVs
   in the IPL will be acceptable with the maximum profit for the grid.
   This article explores the management of electric vehicle (EV) charging
   and discharging in intelligent parking lots (IPLs) in the context of the
   expanding use of renewable energy sources (RESs). It highlights the
   significance of understanding how EVs interact with each other and the
   broader distribution network, particularly in the presence of RESs like
   solar and wind power, as well as hydrogen storage. image},

Title = {Optimal allocation of FCSs and PV units in smart grids considering
   traffic and generation dispatch},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Worldwide, transportation electrification and photovoltaics (PVs) have
   become vital components of modern and future planning problems.
   Therefore, the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs)
   requires reliable fast-charging stations (FCSs). However, random
   allocation of FCSs and PV adversely impacts the performance and
   operation of the traffic flow and power networks. Thus, this paper
   proposes a new planning approach for the optimal allocation of FCSs and
   PVs in large-scale smart grids and transportation networks. Unlike
   existing approaches, the well-known Dynamic Network Assignment
   Simulation for Road Telematics (DYNASMART) is updated and employed in
   the proposed planning approach to accurately simulate the EVs within the
   traffic stream. The average waiting time of the EVs at the charging
   stations (including charging time) and the total annual costs are
   utilized as conflicting objective functions to be minimized. To
   effectively solve this comprehensive model with conflicting objectives,
   a bi-layer multiobjective optimization based on metaheuristic (NSGA-II)
   and deterministic (GAMS) algorithms is established. The outer layer
   optimizes the allocation of FCSs and PV accurately, while the inner one
   optimally dispatches the generated power of the conventional generation
   units. The proposed planning approach is tested on a 26-bus electrical
   transmission network and 92-node transportation system. The simulation
   results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The optimal
   allocation of FCSs and PVs with 80\% EVs penetration increases the net
   profit by 85.36\% while maintaining a maximum of 30 minutes for both
   charging and waiting time.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Two-stage robust economic dispatch of distribution networks considering
   electric vehicles charging demand-price uncertainty correlations},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {248},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With a large number of electric vehicles (EV) connected to the
   distribution networks (DN), the uncertainty of the charging load of EV
   brings challenges to the economic operation of DN. In this paper, the
   economic dispatch strategy of planning and operation is proposed to
   optimize the economy of DN. To better describe the correlation between
   EV charging demand and price uncertainty, a data-driven uncertainty set
   based on adjacent days is incorporated into two-stage robust
   optimization (TSRO) model. The proposed uncertainty set abandons the
   extreme scenario and is closer to the real-world scenarios. In the
   planning stage, charging piles are upgraded to devices with
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service capability, minimizing the planning cost.
   In the operational stage, the recourse method is adopted to quantify the
   worst output scenarios for wind, photovoltaic, and EV charging demands,
   which are reflected as the operating costs of the DN. The numerical
   simulations are carried out under the modified IEEE-33 bus system, and
   the nested column and constraint generation (N-C\&CG) algorithm is
   adopted to solve the TSRO model under data-driven uncertainty sets. The
   results indicate that our proposed model decreases the total cost by
   14\% to 32\% compared to other uncertainty models, which guarantees the
   economy of the decisions made by the model. The analysis demonstrates
   that the model possesses low conservatism while ensuring robustness and
   economy, and is suitable for long-term planning.},

Title = {Hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Modified Salp Swarm Algorithm to Determine the
   Optimal Location of Electric Vehicle Charging Station in Distribution
   Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {132332-132343},
Abstract = {This study utilized a newly developed hybrid algorithm to ascertain the
   most favorable site for the installation of electric vehicle charging
   stations (EVCs). Random installation of EVCs may cause voltage
   disturbances, power quality disturbances and power losses in the
   distribution network. The hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm
   algorithm (HGAMSSA) was used to determine the optimal EVCs placement in
   the distribution network by considering power losses, network capacity
   and voltage regulation. HGAMSSA is a combination of GA and MSSA. In the
   first stage, the GA method distributes the population randomly and the
   second stage crosses the membership between dimensions. In the third
   stage, MSSA processes the best population from the GA to determine the
   best objective function. The HGAMSSA incorporates Optimal Power Flow
   (OPF) calculations based on Newton-Raphson. The OPF simulation uses a
   modified 20kV IEEE 33 bus distribution network. For validation, HGAMSSA
   was compared with four different algorithms: GA, PSO, SSA, and MPSO.
   There are three test scenarios with populations of 100, 50, and 20. As a
   result, the power loss generated as the best objective function wase
   0.15715 MW. When the population is 100, HGAMSSA has the fastest
   iteration (5(th)) in achieving the best objective function compared with
   MPSO (13(th)) and SSA (17(th)). Furthermore, the best objective function
   can only be achieved by HGAMSSA when the populations are 50 and 20. This
   shows that HGAMSSA can explore and exploit populations performance to
   identify the optimal objective function.},

Title = {Optimal allocation of cloud energy storage system in low-voltage
   distribution network},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In low-voltage distribution networks, an uncontrolled charging of
   plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) brings about intensive peak
   loads in distribution transformers' daily load curves. Due to insulation
   degradations, this issue ends in transformers' loss of life (LOL) and
   early aging. The notion of cloud energy storage system (CESS) with
   larger power and energy capacities enables consumers to have access to
   cheaper energy storage facilities. Thanks to CESS installation,
   semi-smart, controlled, and low-cost charging of PHEVs could be realized
   to relieve the transformer's peak loads and reduce the peak-to-average
   (PAR) ratio of load curve. To do so, this paper develops an optimal
   planning model for siting and sizing of a CESS to accommodate the
   charge/discharge requirements of consumers who are willing to
   collaborate with CESS and hence, implementing a controlled charging of
   PHEVs. The proposed model considers the investment and operation costs
   of both CESS and distribution network. It also models the transformer
   LOL costs. The PHEVs, in private garages, are supposed to be connected
   to the grid through a smart module whose connection time and status is
   optimally scheduled and controlled through the operator of the CESS. The
   CESS charging/discharging is regulated such that the previously
   determined time targets of PHEV owners are satisfied. To assess
   performance of the proposed model, extensive numerical studies are
   carried out in terms of techno-economic indices say as PAR reduction,
   conducting energy arbitrage, power losses reduction, and etc. Results
   are discussed in depth.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the challenge of high peak loads on local

   vehicles along highways, particularly in remote areas with weak
   networks. It presents a multi-stage, multi-objective optimization

   results in the minimum BESS capacity and power rating required, subject
   to the various specific constraints to comply with distribution grid
   power quality standards by limiting the peak grid demand whilst taking
   into account several factors over one day, i.e., daily traffic patterns
   (used to estimate charging system demand), and details of the local
   electricity network (demand patterns). The optimization method was
   demonstrated using actual data from an intercity highway and electricity
   distribution network in a remote highway mid-way between two cities in
   New South Wales, Australia. The results showed that no BESS is needed up
   to a critical EV penetration rate, above which both the required BESS

Abstract = {In the near future, millions of electric vehicles (EVs), especially
   plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs), will be integrated into the electrical
   system. Such an increase in the demand for energy will require optimised
   management of distribution networks. This study presents a new
   formulation to determine the optimal size and location of PHEV charging
   stations to maximise the distribution system manager (DSM) benefit. A
   two-stage procedure has been considered to optimise PHEV charging
   station planning. In the first stage, the candidate locations and their
   size are determined based on: (i) the sum of benefits from the
   appropriate use of charging station for charging and discharging of
   vehicles and (ii) the benefit of providing spinning reserve and
   supplying the network's load demand at peak times by DSM. In the next
   stage, an improved framework is proposed to classify charging stations
   into efficient and inefficient sets characterised by non-financial
   indices. The proposed method is data envelopment analysis efficiency and
   three indices, including active power loss, voltage profile improvement
   and CO2 emission. The suggested model is successfully applied to a test

Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a sustainable path for decarbonizing

   sizes of SRPLs by integrating a novel EV user satisfaction cost index.
   The objectives in this stage focus on enhancing the operational
   performance of both the transportation and distribution networks. In the
   second stage, the identified locations and sizes are used to determine
   the optimal operation of SRPLs, taking into account seasonal variations
   in solar generation and load demand. The objectives aim to maximize SRPL
   operator profit while minimizing EV user payments, additional DN
   operator costs, and grid emissions. Fuzzy max-min composition is used to
   determine the optimal solution by simultaneously satisfying all
   objectives to the highest possible extent. The proposed technique,
   idated on real (28-node TN, 69-bus DN) and test (35-node TN, 85-bus DN)
   systems, effectively identifies SRPL locations, ratings, and operation
   strategies. Vehicle-to-grid mode of EVs at SRPLs increases profit by
   26.19 reduces EV user costs by 6.55 \%, and cuts grid emissions by 4.86

Abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) can be effectively integrated with the power
   grid through vehicle-to-grid (V2G). V2G has been proven to reduce the EV
   owner cost, support the power grid, and generate revenues for the EV
   owner. Due to regulatory and physical considerations, aggregators are
   necessary for EVs to participate in electricity markets. The aggregator
   combines the capacities of many EVs and bids their aggregated capacity
   into electricity markets. In this paper, an optimal bidding of ancillary
   services coordinated across different markets, namely regulation and
   spinning reserves, is proposed. This coordinated bidding considers
   electricity market uncertainties using fuzzy optimization. The
   electricity market parameters are forecasted using autoregressive
   integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The fuzzy set theory is used
   to model the uncertainties in the forecasted data of the electricity
   market, such as ancillary service prices and their deployment signals.
   Simulations are performed on a hypothetical group of 10 000 EVs in the
   electric reliability council of Texas electricity markets. The results
   show the benefit of the proposed fuzzy algorithm compared with
   previously proposed deterministic algorithms that do not consider market
   uncertainties.},

   power loss and the cost of installing EVCS in the distribution network.
   The Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimization (CHIO) method is applied to
   solve the problem; the IEEE 34 bus distribution network is used for

Abstract = {/ Electric vehicles (EVs) have been widely acknowledged as one effective
   solution to alleviate the fossil fuel shortage and environmental
   pressure in modern metropolises. To foster the large-scale integration
   of EVs, transportation electrification is becoming an emerging trend.
   This paper proposes a comprehensive model for the expansion planning of
   urban electrified transportation networks (ETNs), which determines the
   best investment strategies for the TN and the power distribution network
   (PDN) simultaneously, including the sites and sizes of new lanes,
   charging facilities, distribution lines, and local generators. The
   steady-state distribution of traffic flow in the TN is characterized by
   the Nesterov user equilibrium (NUE). The operating condition of the PDN
   is described by linearized branch power flow equations. To consider the
   interdependency between the TN and PDN created by the charging behavior
   of EVs, the power demand of on-road charging facility is assumed to be
   proportional to the traffic flow it carries. The expansion planning
   model is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with NUE
   constraints. In order to retrieve a global optimal solution, it is
   further transformed into an equivalent mixedinteger convex program
   through duality theory and techniques of integer algebra; no
   approximation error is involved. Case studies on a test ETN corroborate
   the proposed model and method.},

Title = {Is single-phase residential EV fast-charging a good idea? Evidence from
   optimal charging plans based on realistic data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {152},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One way to encourage the usage of electric vehicles (EVs) is to reduce
   the connection time by using higher -powered charging points at home.
   Nonetheless, a massive adoption of this technology could increase the
   network power requirements, stressing the grid beyond the technical
   limits. Therefore, it is important to assess how much the aggregate
   power will increase compared to the slow-charging process and how to
   minimize it. Hence, an EV charging coordination model is developed to
   compare the impact on the system demand of residential slow and
   fast-charging plans by minimizing the maximum aggregate demand. Here,
   ``slow{''}and ``fast{''}correspond to the minimum and the maximum
   charging speeds for 1-phase, mode 3 of the IEC 61851-1. To create an
   accurate model, realistic UK load profiles, real EV energy requirements,
   and real travel statistics of car drivers in the UK were included.
   Additionally, the stochasticity of customers was incorporated by solving
   the optimization for thousands of different groups of households and
   EVs. The results indicate that due to the greater flexibility of
   fast-charging events, if no coordination is considered, the aggregate
   effects increase by 15\% compared to the slow-charging case. However, if
   the process is coordinated, nearly the same maximum aggregate demand is
   found regardless of whether the charging is fast or slow.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {42},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The virtual power plant (VPP) integrates electric vehicle (EV) parking
   lots as both flexible consumers and prosumer, leveraging their
   bidirectional charging capabilities to improve grid stability and
   profitability. This paper defines a novel method to the improve economic
   aspect of distributed energy resources (DERs) in a distribution network
   through a VPP framework, actively contributing in day-ahead and
   regulation reserve markets. One of the main novelties of this study is
   using a forecasted price-based unit commitment approach for VPPs in
   microgrids with the aim of determining an optimal pricing strategy
   though addressing real-world operational complexities. Also, this study
   integrates a dual-role EV parking lots, acting both as a consumer and
   electricity provider, and explores its potential to minimize costs while
   optimizing charging and discharging agendas. The proposed optimization
   model tries to obtain maximum VPP profits in day-ahead and reserve
   markets by controlling the complexities of distributed thermal and
   electrical production, energy storage limits, and power balance
   restraints. By implementing an efficient model based on the a
   mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), a higher solution speeds,
   global optimality, and scalability for larger problems overcoming
   traditional limitations such as local optima and infeasibility in
   large-scale scenarios is achieved. By considering the uncertainties of
   solar and wind sources, a spinning reservation technique is used to
   increase microgrid stability. This study also examines how demand
   response programs help gas stations operate better and facilitate
   effective energy transfers between VPPs and the upstream network. As a
   major step toward increasing microgrid profitability and operational
   efficiency, the results demonstrate the superiority of establishing a

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Acting as a key to future environmentally friendly transportation
   systems, electric vehicles (EVs) have attached importance to develop
   fast charging technologies to accomplish the requirement of vehicle
   users. However, fast charging behaviors would cause degradations in EVs'
   batteries, as well as negative effects like new demand peak and feeder
   overloads to the connected distribution network, especially when
   plugging in large scale EVs. Decentralized coordination is encouraged
   and our goal is to achieve an optimal strategy profile for EVs in a
   decentralized way considering both the need of fast charging and
   reducing degradations in batteries and the distribution network. In this
   article, we innovatively model the EV fast charging problem as an
   optimization coordination problem subject to the coupled feeder capacity
   constraints in the distribution network. The need of fast charging is
   expressed by the total charging time, and the relative tendency to fully
   charge within the desired time period. We introduce a l(0) -norm of the
   charging strategy which is non-convex to represent the total charging
   time, and apply the l(1)-norm minimization to approximate the sparse
   solution of l(0)-norm minimization. The shorter the charging horizon is
   the stronger willing of fast charging the user has. The objective of the
   optimization problem tradeoffs the EVs' battery degradation cost, the
   load regulation in the distribution network, the satisfaction of
   charging and the total charging time, which is non-separable among
   individual charging behaviors. Even though alternating direction method
   of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely applied in distributed
   optimization with separable objective and coupled constraints, its
   decentralized scheme cannot be applied directly to the underlying
   non-separable EV charging coordination problem. Hence, a hierarchical
   algorithm based on ADMM is proposed such that the convergence to the
   optimal strategies is guaranteed under certain step-size parameter.
   Furthermore, a receding horizon based algorithm is proposed considering
   the forecast errors on the base demand and the EV arrival distribution.
   The results are demonstrated via some simulation results.},

Abstract = {The increasing proportion of distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) and
   electric vehicle charging stations in low-voltage distribution networks
   (LVDNs) has resulted in challenges such as distribution transformer
   overloads and voltage violations. To address these problems, we propose
   a coordinated planning method for flexible interconnections and energy
   storage systems (ESSs) to improve the accommodation capacity of DPVs.
   First, the power-transfer characteristics of flexible interconnection
   and ESSs are analyzed. The equipment costs of the voltage source
   converters (VSCs) and ESSs are also analyzed comprehensively,
   considering the differences in installation and maintenance costs for
   different installation locations. Second, a bilevel programming model is
   established to minimize the annual comprehensive cost and yearly total
   PV curtailment capacity. Within this framework, the upper-level model
   optimizes the installation locations and capacities of the VSCs and
   ESSs, whereas the lower-level model optimizes the operating power of the
   VSCs and ESSs. The proposed model is solved using a non-dominated
   sorting genetic algorithm with an elite strategy (NSGA-II). The
   effectiveness of the proposed planning method is validated through an
   actual LVDN scenario, which demonstrates its advantages in enhancing PV
   accommodation capacity. In addition, the economic benefits of various
   planning schemes with different flexible interconnection topologies and
   different PV grid-connected forms are quantitatively analyzed,
   demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed coordinated planning

Title = {Efficient techno-economic modelling of smart parking lots within the
   electricity distribution networks},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The rapid uptake of electric vehicles is transforming public and
   workplace car parks into large, highly flexible electrical loads whose
   behaviour must be co-optimised with distribution network operation. Yet
   explicitly modelling every plugged-in vehicle makes even modest-sized
   studies computationally prohibitive and masks the economic tension
   between parking-lot owners and network operators. This paper proposes a
   cost-driven optimisation framework that converts a smart parking lot
   into an equivalent energy storage system, retaining hourly accuracy
   while collapsing thousands of binary charging decisions into a handful
   of continuous variables, allowing for the co-optimisation of the smart
   parking lot and the electricity distribution network. In the network,
   non-linear AC power-flow limits are convexified with second-order cone
   programming. At the same time, the discrete operating states of the SPL
   are handled by mixed-integer linear programming. To capture the
   multi-actor reality, separate objective functions represent (i) the
   distribution system operator's operating cost and (ii) the smart parking
   lot owner's profit, allowing for realistic price-signal interactions to
   emerge without resorting to heavyweight bi-level or game-theoretic
   solvers. The framework is first benchmarked on the classical IEEE 33-bus
   distribution network, augmented with photovoltaic, wind turbine, and
   conventional energy storage resources, and then stress-tested on a real
   83-bus primary network from the UK, fed with arrival/departure and
   state-ofcharge data for 200 real electric vehicles from the My Electric
   Avenue project. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model
   confirms that modelling smart parking lots as energy storage system
   equivalents unlocks their value to modern distribution networks while
   keeping optimisation complexity manageable. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Distributed Generators
   in Smart Grids: A Multi-Objective Meta-Heuristic Approach},

Abstract = {The global transition towards electric mobility has significantly
   increased the demand for efficient and consumer-friendly Electric
   Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs). As electric vehicles (EVs) continue
   to penetrate transportation systems, optimal integration of EVCSs within
   power distribution infrastructure becomes critical, not only to ensure
   seamless user experience but also to maintain the reliability and
   efficiency of electrical networks. Traditionally, EVCS planning has been
   carried out solely within the context of Radial Distribution Networks
   (RDNs), neglecting key consumer-centric factors such as travel comfort
   and accessibility within the road network (RN). This paper proposes a
   novel, consumer-aware methodology for optimally placing EVCSs and
   Distributed Generators (DGs) in a combined RDN-RN framework. The
   objective is to minimize active power loss, voltage variation, and EV
   consumer cost, measured through two proposed indices, while accounting
   for realistic travel behavior and preferences. The proposed approach
   utilizes a Modified Weighted Teaching Learning Based - Particle Swarm
   Optimization Algorithm (MWTLB-PSA) and proceeds in three stages: EVCS
   site selection based on road network considerations, DG placement using
   predetermined EVCS locations, and a final stage of simultaneous
   optimization of both elements. To validate the approach, a standard IEEE
   33-bus RDN integrated with a 25-node RN is employed as the test system.
   Results demonstrate that the joint optimization of DGs and EVCSs via the
   proposed method significantly enhances network performance and consumer
   convenience. Notably, the solution achieves a reduced active power loss
   of 57.75 kW and an EVCCI value of 0.3958, indicating a substantial
   improvement over existing hybrid TLBO and PSO-based techniques.
   Furthermore, the proposed method leads to installation cost savings
   ranging from 2.51\% to 18.21\% compared to earlier strategies,
   underscoring its practical value in smart grid planning and deployment.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a sufficient condition for the convex relaxation of
   ac optimal power flow(OPF) in radial distribution networks as a second
   order cone program (SOCP) to be exact. The condition requires that the
   allowed reverse power flow is only reactive or active, or none. Under
   the proposed sufficient condition, the feasible sub-injection region
   (power injections of nodes excluding the root node) of the ac OPF is
   convex. The exactness of the convex relaxation under the proposed cond
   (s) over bar ition is proved through constructing a group of monotonic
   series with limits, which ensures that the optimal solution of the SOCP
   can be converted to an optimal solution of the original ac OPF. The
   efficacy of the convex relaxation to solve the ac OPF is demonstrated by
   case studies of an optimal multi-period planning problem of electric

Abstract = {Planning the distribution network of the future involves forecasting the
   most likely scenario to make appropriate investment decisions. Many
   uncertainties concerning, e.g. the evolution of conventional loads,
   renewable production and electric vehicles (EVs) make it difficult to
   predict the location of the distribution network's weaknesses
   (overvoltages, undervoltages and overcurrents) and their occurrence. In
   some cases, alternative solutions such as demand response (DR) and
   reconfiguration can remove the constraints and prevent expensive network
   investment. This study proposes a two-stage algorithm that is able to
   give the probability that no technical constraints will appear as a
   function of the reinforcement cost with and without using DR and/or
   reconfiguration. The first stage of the algorithm consists in running
   Monte Carlo simulations based on realistic scenarios for loads, EVs and
   renewable production development provided by French governmental
   roadmaps. The cost of reinforcement per line and per hour of constraints
   enables selection of the feeders, where DR (solved with linear
   programming) and/or reconfiguration (exhaustive research) will be
   implemented in the second stage of the algorithm to remove these
   constraints. The methodology is applied to a real part of a French

Abstract = {The rapid integration of renewable energy and electric vehicles is

   Q-network and Prioritized experience replay},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {118},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The rapid growth of the number of electric vehicles (EVs) has
   significantly increased the demand for electricity of residents, which
   may lead to transformer overload of distribution networks if there is no
   reasonable power consumption planning. In view of the coordinated
   charging of EVs under the photovoltaic (PV) energy connected to the
   power grid, a collaborative charging control strategy is proposed based
   on a double deep q-network with Prioritized experience replay
   (DDQN-PER). Specifically, Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network
   is utilized to capture the uncertainties caused by power requirement, PV
   power, and real-time electricity price. Then, a modified DDQN approach
   and the corresponding reward function are applied to solve the
   cooperative charging problem. In addition, the introduction of a PER
   mechanism based on TD bias sampling in reinforcement learning alleviates
   the problem of reward sparsity in learning scenarios and improves the
   training stability and efficiency. The proposed approach can achieve
   collaborative scheduling of EVs, which helps reduce the charging cost,
   promote the consumption of PV energy and avoid transformer overload.
   Simulation case studies based on real data demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm can reduce the charging cost by 30\% and increase the PV power
   utilization by 10\% compared to the DDQN algorithm.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the potential of an independent method of dynamic
   pricing schemes to reduce the peak demand in the neighborhood area. For
   this, this work develops a collective energy consumption scheduling
   (CECS) algorithm in the residential sector based on a combination of
   energy consumption plans under a bi-level game theory method. The local
   level is responsible of gathering internal users' data and reducing the
   energy consumption in each residential building. The central level is
   the external demand management system that is focused on modeling a
   coalition between the local load management modules, as well as giving
   the redistributed demand profile to increase the global profit through a
   peak load minimization, financial gain and peak-to-average-ratio
   reduction. Four controllable appliances are included in load shifting
   and time activation cycling: clothes dryer units, heating, ventilation
   and air conditioning systems, electric water heater, and electric
   vehicle. The principle of the proposed CECS method relies on the
   flexibility of the user requirement that presents one of the
   contributions of this study. It proposes a novel framework for
   determining optimal non-static load management strategies, in which
   consumers can change their daily power demand patterns depending on
   their routines, preferences and requirements. Numerical results show
   that time-varying schemes encourage customers to condense their
   electricity consumption within low-price periods. However, by
   incorporating the proposed approach of coordinated scheduling algorithm
   significant profits in the whole and single level are demonstrated.
   Simulations infer that given the same load profiles, the proposed
   framework outperforms the non-coordinated strategy leading to important
   rates in total peak load minimization, total saving in electricity bills
   and reduction of peak-to-average-ratio.},

Abstract = {To support the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) in the
   transportation network (TN), one significant obstacle has to be
   addressed: range anxiety, i.e. concern about running out of energy
   before finding another charging station. This study proposes a two-stage
   strategy for optimal placement and sizing of electric vehicle charging
   stations (EVCS) and renewable distributed generators (DGs) in a coupled
   TN and distribution network (DN) by considering EV range anxiety. In the
   first stage, an integer particle swarm optimization algorithm and
   M1/M2/S queueing theory are used to find the best locations and sizes of
   EVCS while ensuring possible origin-destination round trips in a TN can
   be completed with a waiting time constraint. The objective function
   considered in this stage is maximizing EVCS operator profit. In the
   second stage, DN integrated with EVCS is used to obtain the ideal sites
   and sizes of renewable DGs. Modified Newton-Raphson load flow with a
   Q-PQV bus pair determines the ideal sites and sizes of renewable DGs
   while improving DN performance. A cost-benefit analysis is carried out
   to check whether DG planning is profitable. Hong's 2 M+1 point estimate
   method incorporates the uncertainties related to EV behaviour and
   renewable sources. The validity of the proposed strategy is investigated
   using a coupled 33-bus DN with a 25-node TN system. The results reveal
   that considering EV range anxiety, the suggested approach effectively
   identifies the best locations and sizes for EVCS and renewable DGs
   beneficial for both EVCS and DN operators. Additionally, network
   reconfiguration increases the DN operator's profit.},

Abstract = {Accomplishing highly reliable distribution grids is more and more
   important to today's modern society. Along the same line, self-healing
   is one of the most distinguishing features of the smart grid that could
   improve the reliability of the system up to a logical extent. In this
   study, the reliability of the electrical distribution grid has been
   improved by optimal allocation of automatic switches and parking lots
   (PLs). Thus, the optimal places of switches and PLs are determined with
   the purposes of minimising a combined effect of the customer-based
   (system average interruption duration index) and cost-based {[}total
   reliability cost (TRC)] reliability indices. The TRC includes customer
   interruption costs, PLs and automatic switches investment costs, and the
   total cost of PLs incorporation in the service restoration process. The
   proposed approach is implemented in three different planning scenarios:
   switch placement, PL placement, and joint switch and PL placement. The
   particle swarm optimisation method is employed to solve optimisation
   problems. Finally, a standard reliability test system bus number four of
   the Roy Billinton test system (RBTS 4) is used to demonstrate the

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Investigating the optimal location of fast charging stations (FCSs)
   followed by optimizing the electricity sale prices simultaneously for
   plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are considered as critical challenges
   in a power grid. This paper proposes the improved flow-capturing
   location model (FCLM) with mix-integer linear programming (MILP), in
   which the location of FCSs, alongside the electricity sale price to
   PEVs, is optimized so that the profit of the distribution company
   (DISCO) is maximized. Also, it considers renewable energy resources
   (RESs) to support FCSs. DISCO is assumed to be in charge of the cost of
   stations, the expansion network, RESs, and the electricity purchase from
   the network. The goal is to determine with how much price DISCO should
   sell the electricity to PEVs for the return on investment (ROI) rate to
   be positive at a specified time. Moreover, the PEV owners'
   non-utilization function is considered in such a way that the
   electricity sale price to PEVs in stations has a direct relationship
   with the PEV owners' non-utilization. In addition, the growth of PEVs,
   electric load, and electricity purchase from the network are considered.
   The proposed model has been implemented on a 25-node urban traffic
   network fed by a 33-bus distribution network. The results demonstrate
   that the investor provides electricity for PEVs with less price in the
   proposed model because the investment costs of FCSs are reduced by
   34.4\%. Also, by raising the PEVs' charging demand, the electricity sale
   price in the station is reduced. In this condition, the utilization of
   PEV owners is maximized. Moreover, considering RESs reduces voltage drop
   and electricity sales price to PEVs.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The widespread use of electric automobiles will lead to significant
   changes in instantaneous consumption values and the mechanisms that
   govern this consumption. Electricity demand will increase sharply and
   there will be fluctuations in the networks. The only way to cope with
   this problem is to switch to smart networks. This article examines and
   economically analyses the method of switching from a vehicle to a
   network, which is considered to be used to solve the problem of
   fluctuations caused by the integration of renewable energy sources into
   the network. For this purpose, unlike other studies in the literature, a
   simulation study was conducted that took into account both the battery
   life of the car and the driver's behavior. The research to be done in
   smart networks and renewable energy sources should not be accepted only
   for home consumers. In terms of competitiveness, industrial consumers
   need to choose devices that support smart grids when developing and

Abstract = {This paper presents a two-stage adaptive robust optimization framework
   for day-ahead energy and intra-day flexibility self-scheduling of a
   technical virtual power plant (TVPP). The TVPP exploits diverse
   distributed energy resources' (DERs) flexibility capabilities in order
   to offer flexibility services to wholesale flexibility market as well as
   preserving the distribution network's operational constraints in the
   presence of DER uncertainties. The TVPP aims at maximizing its profit in
   energy and flexibility markets considering the worst-case uncertainty
   realization. In the proposed framework, the first stage models the
   TVPP's participation strategy in day-ahead energy market and determines
   the DERs' optimal energy dispatch. The second stage addresses the TVPP's
   strategy in intra-day flexibility market to determine the DERs' optimal
   flexibility capability provision by adjusting their energy dispatch for
   the worst-case realization of uncertainties. The uncertainty
   characteristics associated with photovoltaic units, electric vehicles,
   heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and other responsive
   loads as well as the transmission network's flexibility capability
   requests are considered using an adaptive robust approach. Adopting the
   duality theory, the model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear
   programming problem and is solved using a column-and-constraint
   generation algorithm. This model is implemented on a standard test
   system and the model effectiveness is demonstrated.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {68124-68134},
Abstract = {Electrification of the transportation sector can play a vital role in
   reshaping smart cities. With an increasing number of electric vehicles
   (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging
   infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging
   stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However,
   their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically
   justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical
   system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we
   demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers
   for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost,
   losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic
   (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the
   uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic
   process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the
   constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to
   simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real
   distribution system of the National University of Sciences and
   Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination
   of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from
   \& x0024;3.55 million to \& x0024;1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh
   to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58 \& x0025; to
   22 \& x0025; when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3
   chargers for 20 \& x0025; penetration level in commercial feeders. In
   residential feeder, these statistics are improved from \& x0024;2.52 to
   \& x0024;0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106 \& x0025; to
   14 \& x0025;, respectively. It is also realized that the integration of
   PV improves voltage profile and reduces the negative impact of EV load.
   Our optimization model can work for commercial areas such as offices,
   university campuses, and industries as well as residential colonies.},

Abstract = {As zero-emission zones emerge in European cities, fleet operators are

   clear understanding of the charging infrastructure required and its
   relationship to existing power grid limitations is needed. This study
   presents an optimization framework to jointly design charging
   infrastructure and schedules within a logistics distribution network,
   validated through agent-based simulations. We formulate the problem as a
   mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and develop an agent-based model
   (ABM) to evaluate various designs and operations under stochastic
   conditions. Our experiments compare rule-based and optimized strategies
   in a case study of The Netherlands. Results show that current commercial
   solutions suffice for middle-mile logistics, with central co-design
   yielding average cost reductions of 5.2\%-6.4\% and an average 20.1\%
   decrease in total installed power. While rule-based control effectively
   manages charging operations and mitigates delays, optimizing charge
   scheduling significantly reduces queuing times (99\%), charging costs
   (13.5\%), and time spent near capacity (10.9\%). Our
   optimization-simulation framework paves the way for combining optimized

Abstract = {A coordinated voltage control algorithm is developed to facilitate the
   integration of electric vehicles into microgrids. This proposed
   algorithm reduces the voltage fluctuations via the optimal adjustment of
   the tap positions of on-load tap changers and of the reactive power
   injections of inverter-based distributed energy resources. Based on the
   proposed voltage control algorithm, an industrial implementation
   framework is established to enable the interactive communications among
   the on-load tap changers, the inverter-based distributed energy
   resources, etc. Compared to previous studies on voltage regulation in
   microgrids, this work is distinguished by the fact that the proposed
   voltage control algorithm is implemented and tested on a real-world
   experimental test site, known as the micro smart grid on the
   EUREF-Campus in Berlin. Constraints, such as actual process latencies
   are readily observed. The micro smart grid comprises a power transformer
   with on-load tap changer, rooftop photovoltaic systems, battery energy
   storage systems, and electric vehicle charging stations. The real-world
   test results confirm that the voltage deviations are significantly
   reduced by the coordinated voltage control algorithm, as opposed to the
   uncontrolled state. Thanks to the analysis of the trigger cycle of the
   proposed algorithm, the lifetime of the on-load tap changer can be
   extended while ensuring the effectiveness of voltage control.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Fast-charging stations (FCSs) are critical charging infrastructures for
   electric vehicles (EVs) that can impose a significant load demand on the
   distribution network. Therefore, one of the original challenges in the
   development of EVs is the optimal allocation of FCSs considering the
   goals and limitations of both transportation and distribution networks.
   This paper proposes a model for locating FCSs and renewable energy
   resources (RESs) taking into account the EVs behavior as well as a wide
   range of affecting factors, including the uncertainty associated with
   the RESs, EVs arrival rate, and state of charge (SoC), different driving
   ranges, and all-shortest and deviation paths. The proposed model
   minimizes the costs of installing FCSs and RESs and substation expansion
   and maximizes the traffic flow captured by the FCSs. For this purpose,
   first, the modeling of the uncertainties of RESs and the capacitated
   diversion flow-refueling location model based on expanded networks
   (CDFRLM-EN) is introduced to cover the charging demand of EVs on the
   transportation network. Then the problem of locating FCSs and RESs is
   formulated based on the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model.
   The proposed framework is implemented on a 14-bus distribution test
   system coupled with a 25-node transportation network. The results show
   that the presence of RESs, diversion paths, and the uncertainty
   associated with the arrival state of charge and the driving range
   differences influence the location and size of FCSs, the investment
   cost, and the EVs' satisfaction.},

   of demand, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and market price
   variations while minimizing the total operation cost. Benders'
   decomposition approach is implemented to improve the tractability of the
   original model and its computational burden. A realistic case study is
   presented using a real distribution network in Portugal with high

Abstract = {A fast and efficient charging infrastructure has become indispensable in
   the evolving energy landscape and thriving electric vehicle (EV) market.
   Irrespective of the charging stations' internal alternating current (AC)
   or direct current (DC) bus configurations, the main concern is the
   exponential growth in charging demands, resulting in network congestion
   issues. In the context of exponential EV growth and the provision of
   charging facilities from low-voltage distribution networks, the
   distribution network may require frequent upgrades to meet the rising
   charging demands. To avoid network congestion problems and minimize
   operational expenses (OE) by integrating energy storage systems (ESS)
   into ultra-fast charging stations (UFCS). This paper presents a
   techno-economic analysis of a UFCS equipped with a battery ESS (BESS).
   To reduce reliance on the electric grid and minimize OE, a
   dual-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved via grid
   search and dual- simplex algorithms. Analytical energy and physical BESS
   models are employed to evaluate the optimization matrices. The
   intricacies of BESS aging are examined to ensure an optimal BESS size
   with a more extensive lifespan than the corresponding payback period.
   The integrated BESS significantly reduced reliance on the grid to tackle
   network congestion while fulfilling charging demands. The dynamic
   pricing (DP) structure has proven more favorable, as the average per
   unit cost remains lower than the static tariff (ST). Results illustrate
   that integrating BESS reduces the OE and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) by
   5-to-49\% and 16-to-73\%, respectively. Moreover, the combination of
   70\% BESS and 30\% grid capacities outperforms the other configurations
   with a 73\% reduction in PAR and a 49\% reduction in OE before BESS
   reaches the end-of-life.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new planning framework to determine the optimal
   location, capacity, and types of EV charging stations (EVCSs) in
   multi-energy systems (MESs). We propose a two-stage stochastic
   programming approach -with scenario-based algorithms- that explicitly
   considers vehicle-to-grid (V2G) peculiarities (four-quadrant operation
   and stochastic human factors influence: V2G willingness, walking
   distance, and charging patterns). Considering those factors together
   with MES uncertainties -RES generation, load demands, and electricity
   price- enables a comprehensive study of V2G and MES impact on EVCS
   planning. The proposed approach is applied to both a purely electric
   distribution network (EDN) and an MES to analyze the interplay of EVCSs
   in different energy domains, in consideration of different V2G
   contracts. The obtained results underline that the sole consideration of
   the EDN can lead to non-optimal results, while the more comprehensive
   analysis leads to optimal planning of all energy resources and cost
   savings. Finally, we analyse how each considered factor individually
   impacts EVCSs planning.},

Title = {Cooperative control of EVs participating in demand response based on
   improved discrete-time leader-following consensus},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) participate in the
   demand response (DR) planning and control in the distribution network,
   the grid power imbalance is aggravated, which affects the stabilization
   of voltage at charging side (VCS) of EV charging stations (EVCSs).
   Therefore, in this paper, the cost model of EV DR and incremental cost
   rate (ICR) model of load response are established at first for solving
   the problems. Then, the ICR update criteria of agents are designed.
   Based on the criteria, an improved discrete-time leader-following
   consensus (IDTLFC) algorithm based on ICR is proposed. Also, the
   cooperative control method of EVs participating in DR based on the
   algorithm was presented. By employing the proposed algorithm, the method
   can calculate the ICR and response load value of agents. Likewise, the
   quick reduction of total system power offset and the completion of
   response load indicator can be achieved by utilizing the EV response
   layer to execute the response instructions. In the simulation
   experiments, the simulation model of multi-agent system based on EVs is
   established. The two system working modes of ``peak shaving and valley
   filling{''} (PSVF), plug-and-play characteristic of agents and so on are
   simulated. The results have shown that, when EV are linked to the grid
   and generate the power fluctuation, the total power balance and the
   stabilization of VCS could be kept with the method. The PSVF, minimum
   response cost and reasonable power distribution are realized
   simultaneously. The system has superior dynamic and steady-state
   performance, too.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the rapid advancement of transportation electrification, especially
   dynamic wireless charging technology, the interconnection between the
   transportation network and the power distribution network has become
   increasingly evident at both the informational and physical levels.
   Consequently, the emergence of integrated transportation-power energy
   systems has garnered considerable attention. It is urgent to realize a
   coordinated operation of the energy systems. In this paper, considering
   the elastic charging behavior and mileage limitation of electric
   vehicles, a modeling framework and corresponding solution algorithms are
   proposed to coordinate transportation and power distribution networks
   operation. In the transportation network, a traffic assignment model
   with the elastic charging demand and effective path generation models
   with the mileage limitation of electric vehicles are established to
   calculate the actual charging demand of electric vehicles and traffic
   flow distribution. In the power distribution network, an optimal power
   flow model based on second-order cone relaxation is established to
   calculate the power flow distribution and scheduling plans of
   generators. And then, based on the idea of alternating direction
   multiplier method, a distributed coordinated operation method and
   solution algorithm for the integrated transportation-power energy
   systems are proposed. Finally, a case study is performed to verify the

Abstract = {This paper studies the electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling problem
   to match the stochastic wind power. Besides considering the optimality
   of the expected charging cost, the proposed model innovatively
   incorporates the matching degree between wind power and EV charging load

   and dynamics in wind energy supply and EV charging demand, this
   stochastic and multistage matching is formulated as a Markov decision
   process. In order to enhance the computational efficiency, the effort is
   made in two aspects. Firstly, the problem size is reduced by aggregating
   EVs according to their remaining parking time. The charging scheduling
   is carried out on the level of aggregators and the optimality of the
   original problem is proved to be preserved. Secondly, the
   simulation-based policy improvement method is developed to obtain an
   improved charging policy from the base policy. The validation of the

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper presents a probabilistic model for the flexibility assessment
   of electric vehicles in residential areas. The flexibility is modelled
   and evaluated in terms of the aggregate charging demand which can be
   rescheduled to prevent exceeding network capacity. Developed model and
   corresponding calculations are based on the algebra of random variables.
   Main factors which affect the flexibility of electric vehicles are
   identified and modelled first. Modelled quantities and their mutual
   links are then incorporated into the probabilistic model. Cumulative
   distribution of charging duration, discrete probability of charging on
   particular day and discrete probabilities of possible start charging
   time are presented in the paper as the probabilistic model outputs.
   Finally, limits of available flexible capacity {[}kW] are calculated and
   presented as the main flexibility indicator for specified test cases.
   Presented results illustrate a potential for rescheduling charging
   sessions in different cases/scenarios. Developed model is expected to be
   of particular interest for distribution network planning during the
   2020s and early 2030s.},

Title = {Grid-aware charging infrastructure deployment: A hybrid monte Carlo and
   improved hummingbird algorithm for cost-efficiency and load balancing},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {249},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The large-scale grid connection of electric vehicles is increasingly
   putting pressure on the distribution network, and the problem of load
   imbalance poses serious challenges to the stability and operational
   efficiency of the power grid. The current research mainly focuses on
   single facility planning or simple optimization models, which are
   difficult to solve the complex interaction problems between
   spatiotemporal charging dynamics, user service demands, and grid
   constraints. To this end, this study proposes an innovative framework
   for collaborative planning of charging and swapping facilities. Firstly,
   Monte Carlo simulation of spatiotemporal load distribution is used to
   coordinate the allocation of charging and swapping facility resources,
   breaking through the limitations of traditional isolated planning.
   Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed, using a
   weighted sum strategy to coordinate construction costs, user waiting
   time, and grid stability indicators, achieving dynamic balance of
   conflicting objectives. Furthermore, the Improved Hummingbird Algorithm
   (IAHA) is developed, which integrates chaotic mapping to enhance
   population diversity, and combines non-uniform mutation to achieve
   adaptive global local search, effectively solving high-dimensional
   complex programming problems. A case study in a certain region of
   northern China shows that compared to particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithm, this framework can reduce annual infrastructure costs by 62.3
   million yuan, improve convergence speed by 40\%, and significantly
   improve the load balancing characteristics of the power grid. This study
   provides a solid theoretical foundation and practical solutions for
   optimizing charging infrastructure, which has important guiding
   significance for the flexible operation of smart grids and the
   improvement of user service quality.},

Abstract = {The deployment of batteries in the distribution networks can provide an

   the problem of optimal placement and sizing of distributed battery

   formulated as an optimization framework wherein the objective function
   is to minimize the annualized sum of investment costs and operational

   addition, while the problem model is as nonlinear programming, this
   paper suggests an equivalent linear programming model for all

   reach the global optimal solution with low error calculation. In the
   next step, the Benders decomposition approach is deployed to acquire

Abstract = {Nowadays, legacy electrical distribution systems are migrating to a new
   modern electric grid with the capability of supporting different
   applications such as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), distributed
   energy resources, and electric vehicles. Among these applications, AMI
   is playing an important role in delivering data from customers to power
   utilities, supporting reliable real-time monitoring, and remote
   operation of power quality data and voltage profile. The AMI consists of
   smart meters, data aggregation points (DAPs), the utility control
   center, and communication networks. Appropriate network planning plays
   an essential role in facilitating the exchange of data between consumers
   and power utilities as well as accommodating new smart grid applications
   and future growth. This work proposes an optimal placement of DAPs for
   AMI based on machine learning clustering techniques in residential
   grids. Network partitioning is introduced to create sub-networks and
   graph algorithms generate a deployment topology given optimization
   constraints. A new measurement metric called coverage density is
   considered to indicate neighborhood area networks (NAN) zones with the
   appropriate coverage. Three real scenarios of NAN are considered: urban,
   suburban, and rural. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared
   with conventional heuristic optimization methods with respect to average

Journal = {IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION},
Year = {2025},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The increasing penetration of electric vehicles will be accompanied for
   a wide deployment of charging infrastructures. Large charging demand
   brings formidable challenges to existing power networks, driving them
   near to their operational limits. In this regard, it becomes pivotal
   developing novel energy management strategies for active distribution
   networks that take into account the strategic behaviour of parking lots.
   This paper focuses on this issue, developing a novel energy management
   tool for distribution networks encompassing distributed generators and
   parking lots. The new proposal casts as a tri-level game equilibrium
   framework where the profit maximization of lots is implicitly
   considered, thus ensuring that network-level decisions do not detract
   the profit of parking owners. The original tri-level model is reduced
   into a tractable single-level mixed-integer-linear programming by
   combining equivalent primal-dual and first-order optimality conditions
   of the distribution network and parking operational models. This way,
   the model can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers, with superiority
   against other approaches like metaheuristics. The developed model is
   validated in well-known 33-, and 85-bus radial distribution systems.
   Results show that, even under unfavourable conditions with limited
   distributed generation, charging demand is maximized, thus preserving
   the interests of parking owners. Moreover, the model is further
   validated through a number of simulations, showing its effectiveness.
   Finally, it is demonstrated that the developed tool scales well with the
   size of the system, easing its implementation in real-life applications.},

   distributed generations that considers the transportation loads and the
   typical source-load spatiotemporal scenarios. Firstly, the probability
   model of distributed generation and various electric loads are
   established. And the typical source-load spatiotemporal scenarios are
   established according to the probability theory and the multi-scenario
   analysis method. Then three objective functions are represented for the
   planning model, the objective functions includes the economic objective
   minimal average annual comprehensive cost of distributed generation, the
   technical objective maximal comprehensive utilization rate and the
   security objective minimal average voltage offset of the bus. The
   multi-objective function is solved by a hybrid multi-objective
   algorithm, which combines Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated
   Annealing. Finally, A IEEE-33 bus system in port area of China is
   employed to verify the effectiveness of the prosed model and algorithm.},

Abstract = {DC distribution networks and micro grids are gaining importance enabling
   the integration of hybrid distributed generation, energy storage units,
   modern loads including electric vehicles and different micro grid
   topologies, thus permitting the consequent development of DC
   Distribution Systems (DCDS). For maximum utilization of distribution
   network without compromising the security and reliability of the supply
   system, determination of critical loading is crucial. With this
   objective, this paper proposes a modified DC continuation power flow
   based approach for determining the loadability limit of the active DCDS.
   DC-DC converters play an important role in bus voltage regulation and
   system loadability. Impact of these converters must be accounted in any
   analysis and planning of active DCDS. In this paper, two different
   mathematical models of lossless DC-DC converters are developed to
   account them in power flow model of the system. The proposed approach
   can be applied to both radial and meshed DCDS. Impacts of integration of
   converters in the system are illustrated by results of two realistic
   DCDS and results are compared with the corresponding AC Distribution
   Systems (ACDS).},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The progressive electrification of urban distribution fleets, motivated
   by the consolidation of electric vehicle technology and by the mobility
   advantages that cities grant to non-polluting vehicles, poses future
   challenges that affect electrical distribution networks. This paper
   simulates the main last mile distribution models that can be adopted in
   a mega-city such as Madrid. In particular, the impact of carrying out
   the full load of the last mile distribution by means of electric
   vehicles is analyzed. Two fundamental aspects are studied, the
   efficiency of the different routes developed by each transport vehicle
   and the impact that these routes have in the electrical distribution
   network. For this purpose, an intelligent route planner, capable of
   optimizing the distribution of the load among the number of vehicles
   available in each postal service hub (PSH), is combined with a Reference
   Network Model that designs and expands the distribution network to
   supply consumers and electric vehicles. Several scenarios in terms of
   location and segmentation of postal service hubs are analyzed. From this
   analysis, it is concluded that reinforcements on the distribution
   network are avoided if the operation is decentralized (using fourteen
   PSHs), since a centralized operation (a single PSH) would require longer
   routes with higher energy consumption. Moreover, decentralized operation
   would enhance the emissions reduction achieved by electrifying the
   fleet, since the estimated absolute emissions of the electrified fleet
   for a decentralized scenario are up to 50\% lower compared to a
   centralized one. Finally, the results reveal that smart charging
   strategies also contribute to lessen the incremental costs in the
   distribution network, in addition to significantly reducing the cost of
   energy supply.},

   Spatio-Temporal Expanding Grids},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {7280-7294},
Abstract = {The number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the size of smart grid are
   witnessing rapid expansion in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This
   requires an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of
   charging stations (CSs). Such an allocation strategy should provide
   acceptable charging services at different deployment stages while
   meeting financial and technical constraints. As new CSs get allocated,
   distributed generation (DG) units need to be also dynamically allocated
   in both space and time to compensate for the increment in the loads due
   to the EV charging requests. Unfortunately, existing power grid models
   are not suitable to reflect such spatio-temporal evolution, and hence,
   new models need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a
   spatio-temporal expanding power grid model based on stochastic geometry.
   Using this flexible model, we perform a dynamic joint allocation of EV
   CSs and DG units based on a constrained Markov decision process. The
   proposed dynamic allocation strategy accounts for charging coordination
   mechanism within each CS, which in turn allows for maximal usage of
   deployed chargers. We validate the proposed stochastic geometry-based
   power grid model against IEEE 123-bus test system. Then, we present a
   case study for a 5-year CSs deployment plan.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) technology has drawn increasing amounts
   of attention in the last decade. As the world's largest automotive
   market, China has recently made the electrification of transportation
   central to its national strategic plan. Because of the unique nature of
   the vertically regulated power industry, China's massive deployment of
   PEVs has to face unique challenges that may not be encountered by any
   other country/region. Therefore, a comprehensive coordinated PEV
   charging scheme is urgently needed to facilitate the smooth grid
   integration of PEVs at all levels (e.g., transmission systems,
   distribution systems, and charging stations). This paper presents
   detailed mathematical modeling of a novel hierarchical framework for
   coordinated PEV charging at multiple timescales (i.e., day-ahead and
   real-time). The proposed three-level (e.g., provincial level, municipal
   level, and charging station level) PEV charging strategy jointly
   optimizes system load profile and charging costs while satisfying
   customer charging requirements. The interrelationships between various
   levels in terms of energy transaction and information exchange are
   clearly identified. Case studies on Guangdong Province, China, are
   carried out and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   proposed hierarchical control framework in reducing system peak demand

   OPF-based approach},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {250},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and residential
   photovoltaic (PV) systems in three-phase low voltage (LV) networks is
   prompting the need for cost-effective designs in brand-new neighborhoods
   that address the challenges of managing voltage (drop/rise) and asset
   congestion. This requires selecting the most appropriate conductors,
   transformers, and voltage regulation devices, which becomes a complex
   combinatorial problem. This paper proposes a bi-period three-phase AC
   Optimal Power Flow methodology to minimize asset costs while capturing
   the time-dependent impacts of EVs, PVs, and the locational effects on
   the transformer's primary voltage. The proposed approach is demonstrated
   using two realistic residential Australian LV networks: one having a
   single circuit with 31 houses, and another having multiple circuits with
   89 houses. The approach identified optimal designs for both networks
   that minimize costs addressing the technical challenges. For
   single-circuit networks, off-load tap changers with thicker conductors
   is the most cost-effective design for both close and distant locations
   (relative to the primary substation). However, in multi-circuit
   networks, particularly in distant locations with significant voltage
   variations, on-load tap changers with thinner conductors is the most
   cost-effective design. These findings highlight the importance of
   considering individual network characteristics to optimally design
   brand-new LV networks with EVs and PVs.},

Abstract = {Energy transition toward smart grids with deep impact of renewables,

   increasingly promote the establishment of energy communities that own

   compact outdoor MV/LV substation to reduce the overall dimensions and to
   make the execution modularized to facilitate management and maintenance.

Volume = {11},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Battery swapping stations (BSSs) present a promising electric vehicle
   (EV) power supplement solution. However, the joint modeling and optimal
   scheduling for multiple BSSs is complex and rarely researched,
   especially when the idle state of charging bays (CBs) is non-negligible.
   In this article, for the distribution network (DN) with multiple BSSs, a
   joint optimal charging scheduling strategy considering the idle state of
   CB is developed to ensure the system's safe operation and BSSs' economic
   charging. In particular, a three-layered coupled model for multiple BSSs
   is constructed by modeling on the CB, BSS, and DN layers, which is used
   to visualize each BSS's state quantity changes and their charging
   behaviors' impacts on DN. To further improve the accuracy of this model,
   the CB's idle state is given special consideration by developing a
   three-stage modeling method, which can detailedly describe the finite
   state transfer of CBs. In addition, to deal with the joint scheduling of
   multiple BSSs (JS-MBSS) problem upon the constructed model, a bi-level
   solving algorithm is proposed to convert the complex JS-MBSS into a
   solvable mixed integer quadratic constraint program (MIQCP). Finally,
   the proposed strategy and two others are verified via the modified IEEE
   33-bus system. The results suggest that by adopting the proposed
   strategy, the total charging cost and the cumulative voltage fluctuation
   are reduced by 39.42\% and 30.84\%, respectively, which verifies the
   proposal's positive benefits in stabilizing grid operation and enhancing
   the charging economy.},

Abstract = {Connecting fast charging stations to the electric grid usually requires
   an upgrade with new transformer stations and cables to accommodate the

   different control objectives and support the grid to reduce the

   on a forecasted scenario and the geographical distribution of new loads
   and generators until 2045. Fast charging stations are added to this
   rollout, and the resulting grid issues are mitigated using a

   are installed in combination with fast charging stations to support
   them. The remaining capacity is used to solve the previously mentioned
   grid issues, using controllers that achieve good performance. The

   the battery-based one are compared in a cost-benefit analysis. Depending
   on cost sensitivities, the battery-based alternative can range from
   being 40 \% cheaper to over 1400 \% more expensive than a conventional
   grid extension-despite potential investment deferrals, which are often
   outweighed by higher capital costs and energy losses. Across all battery
   connection topologies and price sensitivities, the conventional grid
   upgrade solution remains the most cost-efficient one in 89 \% of all
   investigated cases, with the battery-buffered one being only competitive
   in edge cases.},

Abstract = {Increased electric vehicles (EVs) penetration into the distribution
   network burdens the system during the charging process. But the same
   turns out to be advantageous if the EVs are used to support the utility
   based on the requirement. In this work, an attempt is made to
   efficiently schedule both the grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid
   operational modes of EVs with the objective of reducing power loss in
   the distribution system in presence of distributed generation (DG). The
   EVs are modeled by considering the dominating factors, such as EV State
   of Charge (SoC), trip conditions, EV battery capacity,
   charging/discharging levels. An improvement to the existing grasshopper
   optimization technique is also suggested in this article, which enhances
   the exploring capability of the metaheuristic algorithm. The presented
   methodology is a combination of smart charging method, voltage stability
   index, and enhanced grasshopper optimization algorithm (EGOA), which
   decides the size of DGs to be placed in the system. The proposed hybrid
   approach tries to schedule both the EVs and DGs so as to achieve reduced
   power loss and improved voltage profile. In order to test the robustness
   of the proposed strategy, various analyses considering uncertainty in
   EVs and load conditions are performed.},

Title = {Intelligent charging planning for electric vehicle commercial parking
   lots and its impact on distribution network's imbalance indices},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The outstanding demand of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has resulted the
   expansion of parking lots, while leading issues such as imbalance in
   power grid. Therefore, the critically planned charging stations
   infrastructure is essential to resolve these problems. In fact, the
   distribution network operators (DSO), EV users, and intelligent
   commercial parking lots (CPL) owners are holding different views that
   should be considered simultaneously to improve the accuracy of an
   effective business plan. However, the prime challenge in addressing the
   planning of CPL is to increase the EV user interest while enhancing the
   CPL owners' profit. Simultaneously, DSO requirement for network
   performance under the appropriate conditions (for example, imbalance)
   will also be considered. Further one of the main challenges of CPL
   presence in an imbalanced distribution network is the effect that
   additionally carry on network imbalance indices. In this paper, a
   two-stage framework has proposed where the first stage is accompanied
   with several technical parameters such as battery terms,
   charge/discharge specifications, and transportation parameters including
   daily distance traveled, arrival and departure times to the CPL, and
   amount EV sales, the profitability of the EV charging/discharging
   program for EV users as well as CPL owners calculated in the optimal CPL
   scheduling. In the second stage, the effect of CPLs is studied by
   calculating the imbalance indices in a standard IEEE imbalanced
   distribution network. Moreover, the results confirm that the average
   profit for EV users has been increased by 23\% compared to the total
   cost paid for charging EV. Eventually, it is recognized that without
   changing the distribution network structure and connecting CPL to active
   commercial loads of the distribution network, the network imbalance
   could be improved around 30\% during EV charging. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Second life battery energy storage systems (SL-BESSs), previously
   deployed in electric vehicles (EVs), have potentials for being re-used
   for other applications. In this context, this paper investigates the
   utilization of a SL-BESS to support the home energy management. In
   particular, the paper establishes the SL-BESS's model and the
   multi-scale satisfaction indices required to verify the dwelling
   satisfaction conditions of a building occupant. These satisfaction
   indices account for: (i) the usage satisfaction associated with the
   controllable, plug-in appliances to ensure that these are operated based
   on the occupants' desired preferences; (ii) the indoor thermal comfort
   that is controlled through the air conditioner's operation, and; (iii)
   the acoustic comfort that accounts for the possible disturbance induced
   by the appliances' operations. The proposed many-objective home energy
   management system identifies operation plans for the controllable home
   energy resources, aiming at establishing a trade-off among a variety of
   home operation considerations, including the household energy cost, the
   SL-BESS's lifetime preservation, the multi-scale satisfaction indices,
   and the Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR) of the home load. A

   Distribution Network With Photovoltaic Generation and Electric Vehicles},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {34395-34414},
Abstract = {The uncertainties of solar photovoltaics generation, electric vehicle
   charging demand, and home appliances load are the major challenge of
   energy management planning in the residential areas. Optimal allocation
   of battery energy storage systems for distribution networks based on
   probabilistic power flow (PPF) is an effective solution to deal with
   these uncertainties. However, the high computational burden is the main
   obstacle of this method. Therefore, this paper proposes a
   surrogate-assisted multi-objective probabilistic optimal power flow
   (POPF) to reduce the expensive computational time. The surrogate model
   is developed by using a machine learning method namely deep learning
   which is used for bypassing the deterministic load flow calculation.
   Zhao's point estimation method combined with Nataf transformation is
   selected to handle the PPF analysis considering correlated uncertain
   input variables. The multi-objective POPF problem is solved using the
   multi-objective differential evolution. The historical data including
   solar irradiation, ambient temperature, residential load, and electric
   vehicle (EV) travel distance is calculated in the low voltage
   distribution system to demonstrate the potential advantages of the
   proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed surrogate
   assisted multi-objective POPF method provides the optimal solution for
   operating cost, helps to prolong transformer life and reducing
   environmental impact. Moreover, the results show that the proposed
   surrogate-assisted optimization framework gives a better solution when
   comparing with the conventional surrogate-assisted method.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a bi-level optimization problem to obtain the
   optimal location and size of the flexi-renewable virtual power plants
   (FRVPPs) in active distribution networks (ADNs). The upper-level
   formulation of the problem minimizes a normalized objective function (a
   dimensionless function), which is a normalized summation of the expected
   annual energy cost and expected annual energy loss of the ADN, subjects
   to linearized AC optimal power flow (LAC-OPF) equations. Also, the
   lower-level problem minimizes the annual investment and expected
   operating costs of flexible and renewable sources constrained to the
   planning and operation model of these sources in the FRVPP framework.
   The suggested scheme incorporates the unscented transformation (UT)
   method to model the uncertainties of load, energy price, and renewable
   power generation. Then, the KarushKuhn-Tucker (KKT) approach converts
   the proposed bi-level problem into a single-level optimization
   formulation to achieve the optimal solution using conventional
   mathematical solvers. Finally, the proposed scheme is applied to a
   standard test system. Simulation results confirm the capabilities and
   superiority of the proposed strategy in improving the technical and
   economic status of the ADN while obtaining the optimal location and size
   of renewable and flexible sources in the FRVPP framework from an

Abstract = {The alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) which include electric vehicles
   (EVs) and natural gas vehicles (GVs) have gained much attention in
   recent years for delivering a clean and low-carbon urban mobility. The
   AFV development is promoting the coordination among electric power,
   natural gas, and transportation (ENT) networks. This paper proposes a
   coordinated planning method for investment on and operation of emerging
   urban energy infrastructures. The sites and sizes of refueling stations
   are optimized along with the expansion strategies for electric power
   distribution network (PDN) and natural gas distribution network (GDN).
   First, AFV refueling demands are analyzed according to the refueling
   station constraints and options, and transportation network (TN)
   constraints. Second, the coordinated planning model for PDN and GDN is
   formulated along with respective operation constraints in PDN, GDN, and
   TN. An efficient MILP solution method is developed for the proposed
   optimization problem. Finally, several case studies verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed model and its solution method. Compared
   with existing solutions, the proposed panning method offers a more
   accurate AFV refueling demand model with various refueling options. It
   is demonstrated that the coordinated planning can reduce investment and
   operation costs of urban energy infrastructures by exploring the
   pertinent interactions among constrained PDN, GDN, and TN.},

   Response of Different EV Owners},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {The escalating growth of electric vehicle (EV) load has emphasized the
   growing importance of effective scheduling strategies. Due to the
   discrepancies among EV owners, their responses to scheduling can differ
   significantly. Therefore, to achieve better scheduling results, it is
   crucial to consider the impact of these discrepancies on the optimal
   scheduling. This paper proposes a classified scheduling method for
   different types of EV owners. According to charging and vehicle-to-grid
   (V2G) data of EV owners, the K-means clustering algorithm (K-means) is
   used to classify EV owners, and the demand response (DR) model is
   established based on the classification results. The DR model is
   designed to account for the diverse responses of different EV owners,
   and the price elasticity, time gap elasticity, and preference time
   elasticity are important factors in the model. This paper adopts the
   maximization of smart grid's revenue as the optimization objective
   through three approaches: (1) modifying the charging and V2G of EV; (2)
   obtaining V2G prices for all types of EV; and then (3) adjusting the
   power output of each unit. To evaluate the proposed method, the IEEE
   10-unit system is employed for simulation, and the optimization problem
   is solved using the CPLEX solver. Compared to previous studies, the
   proposed classified scheduling method exhibits significant improvements
   in terms of revenue maximization, load distribution among different
   types of EVs, generation cost savings, and load variance reduction.},

Title = {A comprehensive optimization framework for EV-Renewable DG coordination},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {194},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper develops an optimization framework for coordinating electric
   vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) in distribution
   systems. A bilateral contract between EV aggregators and renewable
   distributed generators (DGs) is first used to maximize revenues for
   these market participants by optimally controlling EV
   charging/discharging. The developed market-based EV control model is
   then implemented in a distribution system and evaluated for its
   potential adverse effects on the system operation. An optimal capacitor
   sizing and placement method is proposed to resolve the negative impacts
   of such control model. The proposed capacitor optimization method along
   with the developed EV control model provides an EV-RES coordination
   framework that simultaneously addresses both market and operational
   objectives. A real distribution network is used to test the EV-RES
   coordination method and evaluate its performance for different loading
   conditions using three-phase unbalanced load flow calculations.
   Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in not
   only providing cost savings for the system operation, but also in
   reducing the losses and voltage deviations that would be otherwise
   incurred due to uncoordinated EV scheduling. The proposed EV-RES
   coordination framework is demonstrated to ensure economic, safe and
   reliable operation of distribution systems in which EVs and renewable
   DGs synergize.},

Abstract = {The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) and
   unpredictable load demands are two major challenges in providing
   uninterrupted power supply from a smart grid. One way to address these
   challenges is to use storage devices that can store surplus energy from
   RESs and discharge the energy back to the grid when needed. Researchers
   have recently introduced the idea to use electric vehicles with
   vehicle-to-grid capability, which are called ``gridable vehicles{''}
   (GVs), as storage devices in the smart grid. Using GVs as loads is well
   accepted, but as sources, they disrupt system reliability if
   insufficient GVs are available for discharging when needed. An
   availability planning model is thus required to address this issue. GV
   owners' concern over battery lifetime reductions is another issue that
   impedes the required participation rates for GVs in vehicle-to-grid
   discharge programs. In this paper, we present an intelligent smart grid
   system model, which mitigates real-time unavailability of GV sources via
   an availability planning model. We also propose a GV selection model
   that prevents GV batteries from premature expiry due to their
   vehicle-to-grid operations. Simulation results confirm that our proposed
   models maintain better overall reliability and increase average battery
   lifetime by up to 3.5 years compared with existing vehicle-to-grid

   Charging Technologies: A Multidisciplinary Review},

Abstract = {The electrification of the transportation system is considered one of
   the most viable solutions to address the pressing need to shift towards
   sustainable development. However, one of the major challenges to the
   rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the lack of the right
   charging infrastructure where and when it is needed. Motivated by the
   necessity for a multidisciplinary approach, this study addresses the
   complex operational and planning challenges involved in integrating
   transportation and electrical networks for effective EV charging. Thus,
   this research aims to survey the literature to identify the adopted
   technologies, and the application and allocation of the right mix of the
   technologies to better serve the seamless adoption of EVs. That problem
   is multifaced where transportation network requirements and the
   electrical grid are important to support the charging loads at the
   needed time. The literature survey adopts the PRISMA methodology,
   contributing to the existing literature by highlighting the following
   shortcomings: 1) the problem of allocating the charging technology is
   either purely viewed from a transportation or an electrical perspective,
   2) there is a gap in adopting both networks' requirements
   comprehensively, 3) the literature predominately focuses on a single
   technology either battery swapping or wireless charging, 4) introducing
   new technologies highlights the impact of each on both networks in terms
   of return of investment, traffic flows, and power grids operational
   conditions, 5) research direction is focused more towards operation and
   routing while service allocation is relatively new and has not yet been
   extensively explored, and 6) transportation network research focuses on
   a static representation of the transportation network and EV demand.
   This study's main contribution, besides identifying critical gaps in the
   existing literature and possible future research directions, is the
   proposal of a novel framework that integrates multiple charging
   technologies. This framework is designed to optimize infrastructure
   deployment, enhancing the efficiency and economic viability of EV
   charging systems across both transportation and electrical networks.},

Title = {A Resilience Entropy-Based Framework for V2G Charging Station Siting and
   Resilient Reconfiguration of Power Distribution Networks Under Disasters},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {In the post-disaster recovery of power distribution networks (PDNs),
   electric vehicles (EVs) possess a great potential as mobile energy
   storage units. When supported by vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled charging
   stations, EVs can provide effective supplementary power for
   disaster-stricken areas. However, most existing stations only support
   unidirectional charging, limiting the resilience-enhancing potential of
   V2G. To address this gap, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented
   restoration optimization model that jointly considers the siting of
   V2G-enabled charging stations and PDN topology reconfiguration. A novel
   metric-Resilience Entropy-is introduced to dynamically characterize the
   recovery process. The model explicitly describes fault propagation and
   circuit breaker operations, while incorporating power flow and radial
   topology constraints to ensure secure operation. EV behavioral
   uncertainty is also considered to enhance model adaptability under
   real-world post-disaster conditions. The optimal siting scheme is
   obtained by solving the proposed model. Case studies demonstrate the
   model's effectiveness in improving post-disaster supply and recovery
   efficiency, and analyze the impact of user participation willingness on
   V2G-based restoration.},

Abstract = {The placement and scale of virtual power plants (VPPs) in distribution
   networks are the only topics covered in this article that pertain to the
   resilience of the grid to severe weather. This problem is framed as a
   two-objective optimization, where the expected energy that the network
   would not deliver in the case of an earthquake or flood (expected energy
   not-supplied), and the annual planning cost of the VPP, are the two
   objective functions to be minimized. Noted that the expected energy
   not-supplied in the earthquake or flood condition is considered as the
   resiliency index. The constraints include the formula for VPP planning,
   limitations on network operation and resilience, and equations for AC
   power flow. Uncertainties about demand, renewable power, energy prices,
   and the supply of network hardware and VPP components are all taken into
   account in stochastic programming. The proposed technique achieves a
   single-objective formulation in the subsequent stage by the use of a
   Pareto optimization strategy based on the epsilon-constraint method.
   This article uses a solver based on a hybrid of Crow search algorithm
   (CSA) and sine cosine algorithm (SCA) to achieve the trustworthy optimal
   solution with lowest dispersion in the final response. In order to
   tackle the problem, the proposed system looks at how the VPP affects
   network resilience, scales it, and combines it with the hybrid
   evolutionary algorithm. In the end, with the implementation of the
   proposed design on the distribution network of 69 buses, the obtained
   numerical results confirm the ability of optimal placement and
   dimensions of VPPs in improving the economic status, utilization and
   resilience of the distribution network.},

Abstract = {The electrification of heat and transport through the uptake of low
   carbon technologies (LCTs) is expected to pose significant planning and
   management challenges for distribution network operators (DNOs) in the
   coming decades. Therefore, to support investment decision making there
   is a requirement to understand the impact LCTs will have on low voltage
   (LV) distribution network infrastructure across diverse geographical
   areas. However, LV networks are not only radically different in terms of
   topology and physical asset characteristics, but also in terms of the
   demand they serve which is sensitive to the diversity of local
   conditions such as climate, consumer demographic and building stock. As
   such, there is an increasing requirement to capture elements of this
   diversity in the development of LV network and LCT modeling approaches
   to better quantify place-based LCT impact and to inform the
   quantification of local area flexibility. In turn, using Python and
   OpenDSS, this work presents a novel scalable approach to localized LV
   network and LCT impact modeling by coupling two methodologies; a LV
   network model development methodology and a LCT impact assessment
   methodology which accounts for both the electrification of heat and
   transport with consideration for the diversity of residential heat
   demand. The methodology is demonstrated on LV networks in Scotland
   through quantification of LCT network impact against key network
   assessment metrics. The findings demonstrate the value in spatial and
   temporal high-resolution modeling at scale, emphasizing a need to
   consider the combined impact of electrified heat and transport in future
   network investment planning.},

Abstract = {The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increasing use of
   photovoltaic (PV) generation have introduced new operational challenges
   for unbalanced power distribution systems. These include elevated power
   losses, voltage imbalances, and adverse environmental impacts. This
   study proposed a hybrid objective optimization framework to address
   these issues by minimizing real and reactive power losses, voltage
   deviations, voltage imbalance indexes, and CO2 emissions. Nineteen
   simulation cases were analyzed under various configurations
   incorporating EV integration, PV deployment, reactive power
   compensation, and zonal control strategies. An improved gray wolf
   optimizer (IGWO) was employed to determine optimal placements and
   control settings. Among all cases, Case 16 yielded the lowest objective
   function value, representing the most effective trade-off between
   technical performance, voltage stability, and sustainability. The
   optimized configuration significantly improved the voltage balance,
   reduced system losses, and maintained the average voltage within
   acceptable limits. Additionally, all optimized scenarios achieved
   meaningful reductions in CO2 emissions compared to the base case. The
   results were validated with an objective function Fbest as a reliable
   composite performance index and demonstrated the effectiveness of
   coordinated zone-based optimization. This approach provides practical
   insights for future smart grid planning under dynamic, renewable, rich,

Abstract = {Distribution systems are growing rapidly in size and complexity with
   increased penetrations of distributed energy resources (DER) and
   electric vehicles (EVs), leading to operational challenges. Reactive
   power compensation from photovoltaic (PV) inverters and active power
   curtailment of PV output are commonly used to mitigate voltage-related
   problems. However, the charging/discharging flexibility of EVs can be
   used to avoid PV output curtailment and save energy motivating methods
   to coordinate EV charging with PVs. Unfortunately, a large number of
   control variables makes the centralized voltage control computationally
   expensive. In this work, a decentralized voltage control algorithm which
   considers the active and reactive power compensation from PV inverters
   and EVs is presented. The proposed approach helps to solve the voltage
   issues in a more effective way. The approach involves clustering of the
   distribution network based on modified modularity, an index that
   considers EV flexibility and prediction time period. A model predictive
   control (MPC)-based algorithm is proposed for each cluster to solve the
   voltage problem using the respective PVs and EVs, while ensuring that
   the EV charging demand is satisfied while contributing to the voltage
   regulation. The proposed algorithm is validated using the IEEE 123 node
   test systems under two PV and EV penetration levels and shown to be
   effective in solving the voltage regulation problem.},

Abstract = {Integrating electrified logistics systems with power distribution
   networks (PDNs) poses challenges for jointly optimizing charging
   infrastructure deployment and vehicle routing. Conventional methods
   often fail to jointly address the interdependencies between these two
   systems, leading to suboptimal planning and increased operational costs.
   To address this issue, a two-stage joint-optimization framework is
   proposed to simultaneously optimize EV charging station siting and
   electric logistics vehicle (ELV) routing within PDNs. In the first
   stage, a multi-objective optimization model is employed to determine
   optimal charging station locations, balancing infrastructure costs and
   traffic flow capture efficiency. In the second stage, an adaptive
   routing model integrates charging constraints to optimize ELV
   operational costs. A hybrid optimization algorithm, combining
   self-adaptive MOEA/D and genetic algorithm with best-first search
   (GABFS), is developed to enhance computational efficiency and solution
   robustness. The proposed approach is validated on a benchmark
   distribution network with logistics scenarios, demonstrating significant
   reductions in both capital investment for charging infrastructure and
   logistics operational costs. The findings underscore the importance of
   coordinated charging and logistics planning in accelerating the

Abstract = {The active distribution network is a new solution to the flexible

Abstract = {Security enhancement of distribution networks are constrained with
   multiple causes including limited availability of network resources and
   high penetration of intermittent distributed generation. In that
   context, this paper proposes a new methodology to enhance the security
   of power supply in a distribution network by strategically integrating
   plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) micro grids based on the nodal
   criticality. The nodal criticality is assessed by integrating
   operational uncertainties of events into samples of Monte Carlo
   simulation and then classifying load interruptions on the basis of their
   magnitudes and frequencies. The load shedding due to criticality of
   system stress is classified into arrays of clusters on the basis of
   magnitudes of interrupted loads. The critical clusters that provide the
   largest disturbances to nodal loads are used as the reference capacities
   of PHEV micro grids to mitigate impacts. Case studies are performed by
   applying the methodology into a realistic model of a distribution
   network. Results depict that the proposed methodology can improve the
   system-wide security of supply. There are some nodes of which the
   security of supply can be improved significantly. The levels of
   improvement in security of supply of nodes are not consistent and some
   nodes can also receive marginal improvements.},

   preventive replacement is needed. In addition, the flexibility
   introduced by EVs and installed SLBs should be coordinated to achieve
   optimal economic benefits. This paper focuses on the efficient
   utilization of SLBs by highlighting reliability-flexibility concerns in
   optimal sizing. The model is formulated as a bi-level model. On the
   upper-level, considering the operational reliability constraints of
   SLBs, decisions regarding the investment and replacement of SLBs are
   optimized. Distribution network operations are improved on the
   lowerlevel, with an effective spatiotemporal flexible dispatch strategy
   for EVs. Finally, a linearized process for the optimal sizing of SLBs is
   presented and efficiently implemented. The Sioux Falls network and IEEE
   69-node distribution network are coupled as the test system. According
   to the simulation results, when the state of health of the SLBs
   decreased to 70\%, the conditions were unreliable. The differences in
   the optimal SLB size and costs considering reliability and flexibility
   are highlighted.
   A reliability-flexibility integrated optimal sizing method for
   second-life batteries (SLBs), comprising an upper level that determines
   the sizing of SLBs and a lower level that ensures optimal operation of
   the distribution network, is proposed. image},

Abstract = {Amid power outages during extreme events, the urban distribution network
   (DN) endeavors to minimize power loss and facilitate restoration by
   leveraging emerging technologies, particularly with the proliferation of
   electric vehicles (EVs). This work prioritizes bolstering DN resilience
   through network reconfiguration (NR), emergency repair crew (ERC)
   dispatch, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) response, providing topology, repair
   schedule, and power support. To measure the power support effect of EVs,
   an agent-based model (ABM) estimates EV aggregation for V2G response,
   considering key factors such as EV number, type, self-interested
   decision-making, behaviors, and traffic conditions. By integrating these
   parameters at macro and micro levels, agents interact with one another,
   including EVs, charging stations (CSs), CS aggregators, DN operators,
   and personalized trip advisors (PTAs). PTA navigates EVs to locate the
   nearest CS. Considering the interdependence of the three restoration
   methods, coordinated optimization is designed as a mixed integer linear
   programming (MILP) with the IEEE 33 and PG\&E 69 bus systems. The case
   study shows that the collaboration of these methods enhances load
   restoration efficiency and reduces operation costs. Sensitivity analysis
   on the number and type proportion of EVs and the number of ERCs offers
   guidance for DN operators in recovery planning.},

   Provisioning of Ancillary Services},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {110371-110395},
Abstract = {Distribution networks are suffering a transformation process with the
   insertion of distributed energy resources, changing from a passive part
   of the power grid into an active system. Aiming to reduce the challenges
   for the distribution system operators to keep the power grid operating
   inside of the quality levels it is possible to propose some ancillary
   services. Optimum Power flow is an optimization method used to plan the
   distribution grid operation. Additionally, the distributed energy
   resources can be modeled on it and ancillary services provisioning can
   be considered, as proposed in this work. In this way, the objective of
   the present work is to formulate a Multiperiod Optimum Power Flow
   (MPOPF) with the insertion of distributed generation, energy storage
   systems, microgrids, and electric vehicles at the distribution grid.
   This MPOPF considers the provisioning of ancillary services by the
   inverters associated with the equipment connected to the main grid. In
   the formulation, the entire grid is modeled, considering the placement
   of classic equipment as a voltage regulator and capacitor banks, in
   addition to modern technologies as DFACTS (Distribution - Flexible AC
   Transmission System) and four-quadrant inverters. The MPOPF was
   simulated for several scenarios considering a 90-bus test feeder and a
   real distribution grid from Curitiba - Brazil. From the results, the
   MPOPF proved to be highly robust, being able to simulate the grid with
   all the equipment connected simultaneously, performing the optimal
   dispatch of active and reactive power, as well as allowing the operation
   of ancillary services such as voltage support, peak-shaving, and
   demand-side management.},

Abstract = {Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable
   energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately
   grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the
   empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this
   regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS
   and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed
   approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG
   control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water
   electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment,
   DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and
   electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs)
   with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS
   expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective
   optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective
   functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs. The simulation
   results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach which resulted
   in a notable HC increase of up to 17.24\%, accompanied by a significant
   cost reduction. The proposed approach is also applied to define the
   optimal number of HS to maximize RES capacity.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an optimization model for transmission and distribution
   network integration is proposed. The proposed model is a bi-level
   optimization model formulated as an upper and lower-level problem. The
   problem of unit commitment in the transmission network as the upper
   level problem with the aim of reducing operating costs and load shedding
   as a mixed integer linear programming model and the problem of optimal
   operation in the distribution network by considering renewable and
   non-renewable resources along with electric vehicle charging stations
   (EVCS), it has been considered as a linear model with the aim of
   reducing the cost of purchasing power from the transmission network and
   increasing the use of renewable energy and charging power of EVCS.
   According to the literature, the study gap can be seen in three key
   points; firstly, it is of great importance to provide a convex model
   that can guarantee global optimal solutions. The next point is related
   to the problem-solving time, according to the dimensions and number of
   variables and parameters in the problem of optimal coordination of the
   transmission and distribution network, providing a method to achieve
   global optimal solutions in the shortest time and the last point is
   related to the modeling of any number of distribution networks is
   integrated with the transmission network. To solve the proposed bi-level
   optimization problem, the method of rewriting the optimization problems
   using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition equations, which can model global
   optimal solutions as well as fast solution time and modeling a large
   number of distribution networks in the transmission network has been
   proposed. Several different networks have been considered for the
   validation of the proposed model and method, which proves the results
   obtained from the simulation of the efficiency of the proposed model and
   method in considering the coordinated operation of transmission and
   smart distribution networks. The results showed that the proposed method
   is about 40\% faster than the decomposition method and 20\% faster than
   the evolutionary method, and the results obtained are about 7\% more
   optimal than the evolutionary method.},

Abstract = {For the large-scale promotion of electric vehicles (EV), reliable
   fast-charging stations (FCS) demand high priority among EV users.
   However, unplanned locations of charging stations (CSs) and station
   capacity determination have adverse effects on the operation and the
   performance of power-distribution network. In this study, we developed
   an optimal FCS-planning model considering the aspects of EV users'
   convenience, station economic benefits, the impact on distribution
   systems and the effect on environment. A queuing-theory-based CS sizing
   algorithm that benefits EV users as well as improves CS capacity
   utilization was proposed. The proposed planning model was verified
   through a case study using real road network data by employing
   multi-objective binary and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. In
   addition, to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed sizing algorithm,
   sensitivity analyses for different EV penetration levels and station
   utilization were conducted. The simulation results show that the
   proposed CS-allocation model is beneficial in terms of achieving the
   satisfaction of EV users, cost savings, better station utilization, and
   less impact on power grids and the environment. Finally, to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed planning model, a comparative study with
   one of the previous work on CS planning is also performed. The results
   demonstrate that the proposed charging station sizing method is highly
   efficient in optimizing EV users' satisfaction and for better station
   utilization.},

Abstract = {Variations in electricity tariffs arising due to stochastic demand loads
   on the power grids have stimulated research in finding optimal
   charging/discharging scheduling solutions for electric vehicles (EVs).
   Most of the current EV scheduling solutions are either centralized,
   which suffer from low reliability and high complexity, while existing
   decentralized solutions do not facilitate the efficient scheduling of
   on-move EVs in large-scale networks considering a smart energy
   distribution system. Motivated by smart cities applications, we consider
   in this paper the optimal scheduling of EVs in a geographically
   large-scale smart energy distribution system where EVs have the
   flexibility of charging/discharging at spatially-deployed smart charging
   stations (CSs) operated by individual aggregators. In such a scenario,
   we define the social welfare maximization problem as the total profit of
   both supply and demand sides in the form of a mixed integer non-linear
   programming (MINLP) model. Due to the intractability, we then propose an
   online decentralized algorithm with low complexity which utilizes
   effective heuristics to forward each EV to the most profitable CS in a
   smart manner. Results of simulations on the IEEE 37 bus distribution
   network verify that the proposed algorithm improves the social welfare
   by about 30\% on average with respect to an alternative scheduling
   strategy under the equal participation of EVs in charging and
   discharging operations. Considering the best-case performance where only
   EV profit maximization is concerned, our solution also achieves upto
   20\% improvement in flatting the final electricity load. Furthermore,
   the results reveal the existence of an optimal number of CSs and an
   optimal vehicle-to-grid penetration threshold for which the overall
   profit can be maximized. Our findings serve as guidelines for V2G system
   designers in smart city scenarios to plan a cost-effective strategy for
   large-scale EVs distributed energy management.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a quantitative model is implemented with the main goal of
   building a decision support tool to assess the feasibility of applying a
   Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) service by a company operating a fleet of electric
   buses. The proposed model can calculate the energy that a vehicle within
   a depot can deliver back to the grid during periods of peak energy
   demand, based on the operational schedule that must be guaranteed
   (number of buses in service). After a presentation of the main features
   of V2G and the main benefits this technology can bring to the
   transportation company, the model structure, and related algorithms, as
   well as input and output data, are presented and discussed. To verify
   the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model, a case study
   related to the company that manages public transportation in the city of
   Milan, Italy, is described. 2 depots were analyzed considering the
   energy load during peak hours and the energy that could be injected into
   the grid considering the vehicles parked in the depot. From a
   quantitative point of view, V2G could feed about 7 MW to 10 MW into the
   grid, depending on the day of the week and time of day. Considering an
   average connection of 3 kW for a household, between 2,300 and 3,300
   households could be served. In addition, an economic evaluation was
   performed considering energy trading: monthly, total revenues are 45,922

Volume = {8},
Pages = {221599-221611},
Abstract = {Energy management (EM) has become very attractive in smart grid era for
   both industry and academia. EM in a power distribution system (PDS) can
   reduce the system losses, operational costs and emissions, and increases
   system's reliability, voltage stability and efficiency. This article
   expands the PDS using different distributed energy resources (DERs) and
   observes their impacts on EM success, operational costs, system losses,
   and emissions. Moreover, the impacts of integrating reactive sources
   (RSs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and electric vehicles (EVs) on the
   system's operational performance is investigated. An index is defined to
   measure the energy management success rate (EMSR) and several case
   studies are created for investigating variety of system expansion
   options individually and collectively. Furthermore, a new reliability
   index, namely reliability index success rate (RISR), is defined and
   sensitivity analysis are presented to investigate the DERs impacts on
   system's voltage controllability and the defined reliability index. A
   new hybrid PSO-TS optimization algorithm is developed, and the
   well-known PG\&E 69-bus distribution network is selected for the
   simulations. Several case studies presented in the paper provide a clear
   understanding of the impacts of integrating different resources on the
   EM as well as other operational aspects of a PDS. The results reveal
   that the system expansion using DERs with different capacities along
   with EM strategies could have significant impacts on PDS performance
   depending on the DERs types' and capacities. Due to their availability
   and low operational costs, gas turbine further improves the performance
   indices comparing to the renewables that have uncertain availability and
   to diesel generators with their high operational costs.},

Title = {A novel method for eliminating the exponential growth of computing
   optimal demand response events for large-scale appliances re-scheduling},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The electric grid is undertaking a change of paradigm. New requirements
   such as the high power loads of Electric Vehicles' charging are putting
   pressure on grids, and the popularisation of the figure of the
   prosumers, are creating new needs on the management of the system.
   Although the investment on infrastructure is one of the ways of
   alleviating the arrival of this new loads, the existence of smart
   controls, actuators and smart appliances opens also the door for demand
   modification. The so called Demand Response Events are strategies to
   reallocate the loads of the consumers, so the power demand is shifted
   towards times less critical for the grid. Some smart appliances can be
   considered as shiftable. The operation of them can be rescheduled to
   other times and still provide their services. On this paper we suggest
   an optimisation methodology consisting on a parallelisation method
   together with a generic algorithm that would allow an overlooking
   controller (such as aggregator or DSO) reduce the power peaks even with
   a large number of devices to control. The research here presented has
   looked for the smallest group size at which the optimisation is more
   effectible done in parallel groups rather than on a single large set.
   With this, we eliminated the exponential growth of the computational
   effort that the optimisation algorithm would need to do organising all
   devices in one go. The method achieves a computational time reduction of
   80\%, and it is only worsening the reduction of peak by 2.8\% compared
   to an optimisation with a complete set. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {The randomness and dimensionality growth of variables in the Coupled
   transportation and power distribution systems (CTPS) pose challenges for
   effectively solving CTPS dispatching tasks. This paper presents a
   hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) method, which disperses
   the action and state space of CTPS onto decision- making layer and
   autonomous optimization layer. The Cloud DRL model in the
   decision-making layer is responsible for the load assignment task of
   charging stations. The distribution network (DN) and transportation
   network (TN) DRL models in the autonomous optimization layer are
   responsible for optimizing the DN and TN respectively. A layer-wise
   training method is adopted to alleviate the asynchronous convergence
   problem of HDRL. Firstly, the Gurobi assists in achieving the efficient
   training of Cloud DRL model by ensuring the reward effectiveness of
   autonomous optimization layers. Meanwhile, the differential evolution
   (DE) algorithm assists in optimizing the diversity and focalization of
   the Transitions by controlling distribution patterns of species
   initialization, during the pre-sampling and training stage. Then, the
   trained Cloud DRL model is frozen to train the DN and TN DRL models.
   This method is tested on two different sizes of CTPS. Simulation
   analysis shows that this method improves the training performance of the
   HDRL model.},

Title = {Quantifying the contribution of EV battery swapping stations to the
   economic and reliability performance of future distribution system},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to investigate the
   potential role of grid-connected battery swapping station (BSS) with
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G) in improving the economy and reliability of the
   distribution system. For this aim, we first develop an empirical
   operating model considering operating characteristics of the
   distribution system with the BSS explicitly. Then, on this basis, a
   rolling optimization scheduling model of the distribution network is
   established. In particular, a refined BSS model including a new
   calculation method of available generation capacity (AGC) is included.
   Finally, a quantitative method to quantify the effect of BSS on
   reliability and economy of distribution networks is proposed. Compared
   with existing works, the main contribution of this paper is threefold.
   (i) A battery-level BSS operational model including AGC calculation is
   proposed to fully explore the V2G potential of the BSS. (ii) A rolling
   optimization scheduling model is established, which fully exploits the
   potential interaction between economy and reliability of system
   operation. (iii) An assessment framework is proposed to analyze the
   special value of BSS resources from aspects of both economy improvement
   and reliability enhancement, which can provide more practical
   instruction for BSS planning. Numerical studies are conducted based on
   IEEE 33-bus distribution network to verify the accuracy and efficiency
   of our approach. The simulation results show that if V2G of the BSS is
   orderly exploited and managed, the net profit of the distribution system
   will increase by 11.97\%, and system expected energy not supplied
   (SEENS) will decrease by 14.34\%. The reliability and economy are two
   contradictory factors, the dispatch model we proposed can achieve better
   economy with the same reliability level. The location of the BSS also
   has important effect of the economy and reliability of distribution
   system. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cellular estimation of distribution algorithm designed to solve the
   energy resource management problem under uncertainty},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {101},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Energy Resource Management (ERM) can be modeled as a Mixed-Integer
   Non-Linear Problem whose aim is to maximize profits generally using
   smart grid capabilities more than importing energy from external
   markets. Due to this, many resources and customers are involved in
   optimization, making ERM a complex problem. Moreover, when the inherent
   uncertainty of weather conditions, load forecast, electric vehicles
   planned trips, or market prices is considered, deterministic approaches
   might fail in obtaining optimal solutions to the problem. In this
   context, evolutionary algorithms are a useful tool to find effective
   near-optimal solutions. In fact, to design and test evolutionary
   algorithms to solve the ERM problem under uncertainty, the research
   community has developed a simulation framework. In this paper, we
   propose the Cellular Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with
   Normal-Cauchy distribution (CUMDANCauchy) to address the ERM problem in
   uncertain environments. CUMDANCauchy uses a univariate estimation of the
   product of Normal and Cauchy distributions over each feature, and
   produces new individuals not only by the sampling of the learned
   distributions but also using neighborhoods of individuals from a ring
   cellular structure. The experiments performed over two case studies show
   that: CUMDANCauchy is as competitive as the previous dominant class of
   algorithms in terms of the global fitness achieved; its convergence
   behavior is among the best in comparison with the other tested
   algorithms; its running time is similar to the algorithm with the best
   global fitness achieved in the first case study, and it is the fastest
   algorithm in the second one.},

Title = {Optimization Approaches for Fast Charging Stations Allocation and
   Sizing: A Review},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {46741-46763},
Abstract = {The widespread use of fossil fuels in transportation has resulted in
   significant carbon dioxide emissions and increased reliance on
   non-renewable energy sources. To address these environmental challenges,
   the electrification of transportation systems through Electric Vehicles
   (EVs) has emerged as a promising solution. However, the successful
   deployment of EVs hinges on the availability of a robust charging
   infrastructure capable of meeting the charging demands and extending the
   driving range of EVs. Nonetheless, the large-scale deployment of EV
   charging infrastructure presents several challenges, including the
   ability of the electric grid to supply the required energy to
   accommodate the charging demand. Moreover, determining the optimal
   locations for fast-charging stations (FCS) in the traffic network to
   ensure accessibility, convenience, and efficient resource utilization
   poses a significant challenge. As a result, numerous studies have
   investigated the optimal allocation and sizing of EV charging
   infrastructure. The primary objective of this research is to conduct a
   comprehensive literature review to examine how this optimization problem
   has been addressed in the literature over the past decade. The review
   aims to identify the key factors considered in the problem formulation
   and the optimization techniques for allocating and sizing the charging
   stations. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was
   conducted following the PRISMA methodology for a comprehensive and
   unbiased approach. This review contributes to the existing literature by
   highlighting critical gaps and proposing a framework that can possibly
   bridge these gaps. The review identifies several critical gaps in
   current research, including: 1) Transportation-focused studies largely
   ignore electrical grid constraints; 2) Electrical-focused research often
   relies on statistically modeled EV charging demand, which may include
   some geographical assumptions; 3) Multidisciplinary approaches
   integrating both transportation and electrical networks are still in
   early stage; 4) Dynamic traffic flow of EVs is rarely considered; 5)
   Exact optimization methods largely rely on linearized or approximated
   models; 6) Dominance of approximate methods in transportation and
   electrical network modeling, primarily relying on evolutionary
   algorithms; and 7) Hybrid approaches are mainly utilized to solve a
   specific part of the problem rather than enhancing the quality of the
   solution. In response to these gaps, the research proposes a novel
   framework to integrate the transportation network and the electrical
   grid planning process, offering a holistic and practical solution in FCS
   infrastructure development.},

Abstract = {Conventional distribution network departs to the smart grid. The parking
   lot will have an important role in the smart grid as a distributed
   generation. Due to the output power of parking lots is uncertain, More
   accurate modeling of parking lot output power is necessary for the
   future of distribution network studies such as Distribution Network
   Expansion Planning (DNEP). In this paper, a systematic method based on
   the Z-number concept is utilized to represent the uncertainty of Vehicle
   to Grid's (V2G's) presence. In order to investigate the impact of V2Gs
   uncertainty on the DNEP, we proposed a Probabilistic-Possibilistic DNEP
   in the presence of V2Gs referred to as P-PDNEPV2G. If the V2Gs
   historical data is incomplete, the proposed structure can significantly
   consider the effects of V2G on the DNEP. In P-PDNEPV2G, parking lots
   output power is described as a probabilistic-possibilistic variable by
   Z-number method. The optimization of P-PDNEPV2G is executed by the
   Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). A 24-bus test system
   and the real 20 kV distribution network of Ghale-Ganj city of Kerman
   province in Iran are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed methodology. Eventually, several analyses are conducted to
   investigate the impact of probabilistic-possibilistic V2G model on the

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {This article explores statistical patterns in energy surplus sales from
   energy communities (EC) with high penetration of distributed energy
   resources (DERs) and their potential role in providing flexibility
   services to the distribution system operator (DSO). The study suggests a
   possible linear correlation between the distributions of the EC's
   aggregated PV generation and energy surplus sales, which could help DSOs
   estimate grid contributions based on solar production characteristics.
   Additionally, it characterizes EC behavior in terms of demand and energy
   trading, identifying hours with a higher likelihood of flexibility
   provision and estimating the potential quantity of such services. To
   generate the data, two optimization models were developed to simulate EC
   operations, focusing on peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and evaluating
   the EC's capability to provide flexibility as a service to the DSO. The
   models employ a second-order cone programming formulation incorporating
   distribution network (DN) constraints and considering different DERs,
   including rooftop solar panels, energy storage systems, electric
   vehicles, and heat pumps. Simulations were performed over a one-year
   horizon with hourly resolution using a modified single-phase version of
   the IEEE European Low Voltage test feeder, ensuring sufficient annual
   data for statistical analysis. As a result, the identified statistical
   patterns could assist the DSO in planning operations based only on
   aggregated community data, avoiding the need to model individual user
   decisions and ensuring data privacy.},

Title = {Energy Management Method for Fast-Charging Stations with the Energy
   Storage System to Alleviate the Voltage Problem of the Observation Node},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Large-scale fast charging of electric vehicles (EVs) probably causes
   voltage deviation problems in the distribution network. Installing
   energy storage systems (ESSs) in the fast-charging stations (FCSs) and
   formulating appropriate active power plans for ESSs is an effective way
   to reduce the local voltage deviation problem. Some deterministic
   centralized strategies used for ESSs at FCSs are proposed to solve the
   voltage deviation problem mentioned above. However, the randomness of
   the EV load is very large, which can probably reduce the effects of
   deterministic centralized strategies. A fast and reliable centralized
   strategy considering the randomness of the EV load for ESSs is a key
   requirement. Therefore, we propose in this paper a day-ahead scheduling
   strategy with the aim of maximizing the probability of the nodal voltage
   change being smaller than a preset limit at the observation node. In the
   proposed strategy, the uncertainty of EV load is taken into account and
   the probability of the voltage change of an observation node is
   quantified by a proposed analytic assessment model (AMM). Furthermore, a
   voltage change optimization model (VCOM) based on a novel control
   parameter b is proposed, where b can be used as a constraint to suppress
   the nodal voltage change at the observation node. Finally, the IEEE
   33-bus test system is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
   day-ahead ESS strategy.},

Title = {Transmission Network Planning in Super Smart Grids: A Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {77163-77227},
Abstract = {For a utility company to reduce CO2 emissions along with managing load
   demands, it must strive for a 100 percent renewable electrical power
   generation. Europe takes initiatives to achieve this goal by developing
   a super smart grid (SSG) based on renewable energy resources (RERs) by
   2050. The SSG is based on two exclusive alternatives: wide area and
   decentralized power generation using large number of RERs. Before
   developing such SSG, there is a need to address the critical issues
   associated with RERs, i.e., load flow balancing and transients
   stability. Considering a reliability issue involved with RERs and the
   random deviations between demand response and generation response
   patterns, load flow balancing and transient stability become challenging
   research issues in SSGs. These technical issues are also considered to
   be more challenging, if an unexpected outage in the form of an
   occurrence of three phase (L-L-L) faults (TPF) arises in SSGs, due to
   power quality disturbances. To address this problem, load flow balancing
   probabilistic modeling is performed in this research paper in order to
   formulate the complexity of randomness between generation and demand
   response patterns through transmission network planning (TNP) in the
   form of a super smart node (SSN) transmission network infrastructure.
   Moreover, a further optimization in SSN transmission network has been
   done with the addition of a cooperative control strategies in terms of
   an integrating vehicle to grid (V2G) technology in SSN transmission
   network in order to achieve further enhancement in load flow balancing
   and transient stability in SSGs. Furthermore, as SSGs power
   infrastructure is based on different clusters, therefore in order to
   accommodate various clusters for load flow balancing, a continuous
   spinning reserve (CSRs) probabilistic modeling has also been performed
   in this paper in terms of its integration in SSN transmission network.
   Considering above probabilistic analysis, future contingencies are
   easily predictable, before any kind of disruptive changes arises in a
   SSGs due an occurrence of a TPF. Moreover, from simulation results as
   performed in this paper, we can easily verified that our proposed
   probabilistic algorithm of load flow balancing and transients stability
   outperforms existing literature work and can also achieved near optimal
   performance, even for a broad range of variations in load and also in
   case of an arising of significant power quality disturbances in SSGs due
   to an occurrence of TPF.},

Abstract = {Today, the evolution of smart grid, electric vehicles (EVs) with voltage
   to the grid mode, and deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) are
   bringing revolutionary changes to the existing electrical grid. Volt-VAR
   optimization (VVO) is a well-studied problem, for bringing solutions to
   reduce the losses and demand along the distribution lines. The current
   VVO, however, does not acknowledge the role of elastic and inelastic
   loads, EVs, and RESs to reduce the reactive power losses and hence the
   cost of generation. We propose a mathematical model Volt-VAR and CVR
   optimization (VVCO)/optimal energy consumption model (OECM) to solve the
   VVO problem by considering load shifting, EV as the storage and carrier
   of the energy, and use of RES. The VVCO/OECM not only reduces the
   reactive load but also flatten the load curve to reduce the uncertainty
   in the generation and to decrease the cost. The system also considers
   the efficiency of the electrical equipment to enhance the lifetime of
   the devices. We develop a non-cooperative game to solve the VVCO/OECM
   problem. To evaluate the performance, we simulate the VVCO/OECM model
   and compare with the existing VVO solution. We found that our method
   took almost a constant time to produce a solution of VVO regardless of
   the size of the network. The proposed method also outperform the
   existing VVO solution by reducing the generation cost and flatten the
   load and minimizes the uncertainty in the power generation. Results have
   shown that exploiting RES will reduce the voltage drop through reducing
   the injection of reactive power to the system.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the stochastic scheduling of a microgrid (MG) to

Abstract = {This paper presents coordinated energy management as a virtual power
   plant (VPP) framework with a wind farm, a storage system, and a demand
   response program in the transmission network according to the
   cooperation of VPPs in day-ahead energy and reserve markets. This
   strategy is based on a bilevel method, where it maximizes the expected
   VPP revenue in the proposed markets subject to constraints of renewable
   and flexible sources and the VPP reserve model in the upper-level
   problem. Also, a market-clearing model based on network-constrained unit
   commitment (NCUC) is explained in the lower-level problem so that it
   minimizes the expected operating cost of generation units constrained to
   a linearized AC-NCUC model. The scenario-based stochastic programming
   (SBSP) models the uncertainties of loads and WF power generation. Then,
   the master/slave decomposition method solves the bilevel problem to
   achieve an optimal solution at a low computational time. Also, since the
   lower-level problem is mixed-integer linear programming, the Benders
   decomposition algorithm is adopted to solve this problem. Finally, the
   suggested approach is implemented on IEEE test networks in GAMS
   software, and numerical results confirm the efficiency of the
   coordinated VPP management in DA energy and reserve markets and its

Abstract = {This paper proposes V2Sim, an open source Python-based simulation
   platform designed for advanced vehicle-to-grid (V2G) analysis in coupled
   urban power and transportation networks. By integrating a microscopic
   urban transportation network (MUTN) with a power distribution network
   (PDN), V2Sim enables precise modeling of electric vehicle charging loads
   (EVCL) and dynamic V2G operations. The platform uniquely combines SUMO
   for MUTN simulations and an optimized DistFlow model for PDN analysis,
   with dedicated models for fast charging stations (FCS) and slow charging
   stations (SCS), capturing detailed charging dynamics often overlooked in
   existing simulation tools. V2Sim supports a range of customizable V2G
   strategies, advanced fault-sensing in charging stations, and parallel
   simulation through multi-processing to accelerate large-scale case
   studies. Case studies using a real-world MUTN from Nanjing, China,
   demonstrate V2Sim's capability to analyze the spatial-temporal
   distribution of EVCL and evaluate V2G impacts, such as fault
   dissemination and pricing variations, in unprecedented detail. Unlike
   traditional equilibrium models, V2Sim captures single-vehicle behavior
   and charging interactions at the microscopic level, offering
   unparalleled accuracy in assessing the operational and planning needs of
   V2G-compatible systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive tool for
   researchers and urban planners aiming to optimize integrated power and

Abstract = {Renewable energy sources and EV growth brings new challenges for grid
   stabilization. Smart grid techniques are required to reconfigure and
   compensate for load fluctuation and stabilize power losses and voltage
   fluctuation. Numerical tools are available to equip the smart grid to
   deal with such challenges. Distribution Feeder reconfiguration and
   reactive voltage injection to the disturbed grid are some of the
   techniques employed for the purpose. However, either reconfiguration or
   injection alone is used commonly for this purpose. In this study, both
   techniques are applied to EV penetration as load and compared. A
   balanced IEEE 33 Radial network is used in this study and selected
   branches with high power losses are targeted for the reactive voltage
   injection and Minimum Spanning tree techniques (MST). EV charging loads
   are usually modelled with time base distribution which requires times
   base power flow analysis for reactive power injection. A comparison
   between coordinated, reconfiguration, and reactive voltage injection
   shows differences in power losses, voltage distortion, and cost saving.
   The analysis is carried out with an integer linear programming technique
   for coordinated charging, a minimum spanning tree for network
   reconfiguration, and genetic optimization for reactive power injection.
   Besides, all power flow analyses are carried out with the
   Backward/Forward sweep method. The information would help lowering power
   losses, grid stabilization, and charging station infrastructure

Abstract = {One of the main goals of SDN is to achieve the desirable operation of a
   highly secure and reliable network in terms of energy distribution.
   Hence, this paper presents the probabilistic planning of distributed
   generations (DGs) and switched capacitive bank (SCB) constrained to the
   securable-reliable operation (SRO) strategy in reconfigurable SDN. The
   scheme is formulated as a four-objective optimization problem to
   simultaneously model the economic, operation, reliability, and security
   indices of SDN. So that the first to fourth objective minimize the total
   planning cost and expected operation cost, voltage deviation function
   (VDF), expected energy not-supplied (EENS), and voltage security index
   (VSI). It is limited to the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equations,
   planning and operation model of DG and SCB, formulation of demand
   response program (DRP), SDN reconfiguration constraints, reliability and
   voltage security limits. Then, the single-objective model is obtained by
   using the epsilon constraint-based Pareto optimization technique.
   Additionally, the non-parametric probabilistic method models
   uncertainties of load, energy price, renewable DGs (RDGs) power, and
   network equipment availability. The strategy is as mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming (MINLP), where hybrid Krill Herd Optimization
   (KHO) and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) achieves a reliable optimal
   solution. The following provides the planning of different sources based
   on the SRO strategy with simultaneous formulation of various economic
   and technical indices considering non-parametric modeling of
   uncertainties and solving the problem using the mentioned hybrid
   algorithm presented the contribution in this paper. By implementing this
   scheme on a 69-bus SDN, the numerical results confirm capability of this
   scheme in improving the economic, operation, reliability, and security
   situation of SDN compared to power flow studies. Where it can enhance
   the mentioned indices up to 16\%, 36\%, 99\%, and 9\% taking into
   account optimal planning and operation of different sources and the DRP
   compared to the corresponding values obtained by power flow studies.},

Abstract = {A major challenge to implementing residential demand response is that of
   aligning the objectives of many households, each of which aims to
   minimize its payments and maximize its comfort level, while balancing
   this with the objectives of an aggregator that aims to minimize the cost
   of electricity purchased in a pooled wholesale market. This paper
   presents a fast distributed algorithm for aggregating a large number of
   households with a mixture of discrete and continuous energy levels. A
   distinctive feature of the method in this paper is that the non-convex
   demand response (DR) problem is decomposed in terms of households as
   opposed to devices, which allows incorporating more intricate couplings
   between energy storage devices, appliances, and distributed energy
   resources. The proposed method is a fast distributed algorithm applied
   to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted DR model. The method
   is tested on systems with up to 2560 households, each with 10 devices on
   average. The proposed algorithm is designed to terminate in 60
   iterations irrespective of system size, which can be ideal for an
   on-line version of this problem. Moreover, numerical results show that
   with minimal parameter tuning, the algorithm exhibits a very similar
   convergence behavior throughout the studied systems and converges to
   near-optimal solutions, which corroborates its scalability.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a comprehensive ADN expansion planning model that

   optimal sizing and siting of NWAs while considering WAs such that the
   ADN's dynamically growing electrical load and EV demand are met while
   maintaining network limits. Given the flexibility of NWA resources, they
   can provide the support needed to the ADN (e.g., congestion relief and

   posed as a mixed-integer linear program to maximize the overall profits

Abstract = {In this paper, a new methodology for optimal planning of charging
   stations (CS) along with capacitors (CAP) using proposed technique is
   presented. In order to achieve a better balance between exploration and
   exploitation for dragonfly algorithm (DA), the quantum-behaved and
   Gaussian mutation strategies on the performance of DA is used. This is
   the novelty of our proposed work. Hence, it is named as quantum-behaved
   Gaussian mutational DA (QGDA). Here, parking lot and capacitor
   allocation is suggested for congestion management along with reactive
   power compensation. In order to optimally determine the parking lot
   size, QGDA is utilized. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is
   tested on adapted IEEE 34-bus distribution network. The result attained
   by QGDA technique is compared with existing techniques such as PSO and
   BBO. With PL, the proposed technique achieves the P-loss and Q(loss) of
   25.61 kW and 25.99KVar. PL and C at same node, the proposed technique
   achieves the P-loss and Q(loss) of 31.09 kW and 32.88KVar. PL and C at
   different node, the proposed technique achieves the P-loss and Q(loss)
   of 25.09 kW and 26.98KVar. Furthermore, the proposed results show that
   an uneven EV charging scenario can cause significant voltage unbalance
   that goes beyond its allowed limit of 2\%.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the problem of simultaneous charging of Electrical
   Vehicles (EVs) in distribution networks (DNs) is examined in order to
   depict congestion issues, increased power losses, and voltage constraint
   violations. To this end, this paper proposes an optimal EV charging
   schedule in order to allocate the charging of EVs in non-overlapping
   time slots, aiming to avoid overloading conditions that could stress the
   DN operation. The problem is structured as a linear optimization problem
   in GAMS, and the linear Distflow is utilized for the power flow analysis
   required. The proposed approach is compared to the one where EV charging
   is not optimally scheduled and each EV is expected to start charging
   upon its arrival at the residential charging spot. Moreover, the
   analysis is extended to examine the optimal siting of small-sized
   residential Photovoltaic (PV) systems in order to provide further relief
   to the DN. A mixed-integer quadratic optimization model was formed to
   integrate the PV siting into the optimization problem as an additional
   optimization variable and is compared to a heuristic-based approach for
   determining the sites for PV installation. The proposed methodology has
   been applied in a typical low-voltage (LV) DN as a case study, including
   real power demand data for the residences and technical characteristics
   for the EVs. The results indicate that both the DN power losses and the
   voltage profile are further improved in regard to the heuristic-based
   approach, and the simultaneously scheduled penetration of EVs and PVs
   could yield up to a 66.3\% power loss reduction.},
