This study investigates the critical issue of optimizing the size and location of these stations, considering total costs, including investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, cost of power system loss, and power system reliability costs. To address this challenge, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a powerful optimization technique, is employed to identify the optimal sizes and locations of FCSs. The PSO enables the consideration of complex relationships among variables such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) demand, station capacity, and power system limitations. From the perspective of the Transmission System Operator (TSO), the impact of FCSs on power system reliability has been evaluated using an Energy Not Supplied (ENS) index to evaluate power system reliability costs. Simulation results on the 193-bus test system in northeastern Thailand, conducted with Power Factory DIgSILENT software, validate the effectiveness of our proposed model and method. The results demonstrate that our approach not only identifies the optimal placement and size of FCSs with minimal overall costs but also ensures the operational security of the power system. The proposed method can solve the problem rapidly and accurately. Additionally, power system reliability is considered a criterion in the proposed method.

The extra loads for charging massive PHEVs could compromise the power system reliability and impose considerable stress on the power system. Transmission line congestions and generation capacity inadequacy could be caused under this circumstance. However, there is little literature which comprehensively studies the impact of large-scale PHEVs on the bulk power system reliability when smart grid technologies are incorporated including smart charging and flexible transmission topology control technologies. This work studies the impacts of different charging strategies and transmission network operation strategies on the bulk power system reliability with high PHEVs integration. An evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the charging load of PHEVs and shave the peak load. A network topology optimization (NTO) operation strategy is employed to lessen the transmission congestions and reduce the load curtailment. Based on the sequential Monte Carlo simulation method, these technologies are integrated into the reliability evaluation process. Numerical studies and sensitivity analysis are conducted on modified IEEE RTS-79 systems. The results verify the effectiveness of the technologies to realize the potential of existing power system infrastructures so as to relieve the stress caused by the PHEVs load, increase the available penetration of PHEVs and promote the bulk power system reliability which is meaningful for power system planning and risk management.

J	Wang, X; Karki, R				Wang, Xue; Karki, Rajesh			Exploiting PHEV to Augment Power System Reliability	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				Article								Environmental concerns with gasoline vehicles have led to increased attention to electric vehicles in recent years. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) use both electricity and gasoline to propel the vehicle, and is being recognized as a potential alternative to conventional vehicles. PHEVs offer opportunity to use electric energy generated by renewable resources and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The electric energy requirement of PHEV can, however, cause negative impacts on the power system reliability, especially when the size of a PHEV fleet is relatively large. This paper presents the development of a probabilistic model considering the driving distance, charging times, charging locations, battery state of charge, and charging requirements of a PHEV. A methodology using hybrid analytical and Monte Carlo simulation approach is presented to evaluate the reliability of a power system integrated with PHEVs, considering the important PHEV characteristics, charging scenarios, and power system parameters. Studies are presented on the IEEE-reliability test system to illustrate the impact of PHEV penetration in a power system. Based on the study results, the methods of augmenting system reliability through controlled PHEV charging are presented in this paper.

Electric vehicle chargers integrate with distribution networks via power electronic interfaces, offering significant control and operational flexibility. The industry is quickly adapting to this rapidly emerging load type, and now requires a robust means for understanding their impact on power system operations. This paper presents a modeling approach to capture the aggregate dynamic impact of these chargers on the power system in response to a range of network fault conditions. Six commonly available electric vehicles were empirically tested under various supply disturbances using a grid simulator, and their fault ride-through performances have been characterised. The undervoltage withstand capability of the six vehicles varied considerably, with fault voltage thresholds ranging between 0.3 and 0.7 pu leading to electric vehicles either ceasing charging for between similar to 2 and 10 seconds, or locking out completely. A composite dynamic load model for electric vehicles was developed and validated, employing the collected empirical data. The validation process demonstrated the aggregate load model's capability to accurately capture the resulting load deficit owing to electric vehicle fault ride-through in response to transmission-level faults. The proposed model is suitable for application in wide-area power system studies to enhance the accuracy of simulated network load response for frequency assessments, operations planning, and other system analyses.

J	Aguilar, JA; Wang, S				Aguilar, Jose Acedo; Wang, Shian			Dynamic Modeling and Optimal Planning for Integrating Electric Vehicles and Renewable Energy Into Coupled Traffic-Power Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				Article								The large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is regarded as an effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Although EVs do not produce tailpipe emissions, their widespread adoption may impose significant pressure on the decarbonization of the power system-a critical aspect often overlooked in planning and policy-making. Moreover, the actual environmental benefits of EVs depend on the source of electricity used for charging. Considering the power demand induced by EV charging, we develop a continuous-time dynamic model for the optimal planning of simultaneous EV adoption and the integration of renewable energy sources into the power system. The interactions between competing entities, such as EVs versus legacy vehicles, and renewable versus conventional energy sources, are incorporated into our mathematical model based on the Lotka-Volterra equations. We formulate an optimal control problem to determine planning policies for EV subsidies, infrastructure investment, and the rates of renewable integration and fossil fuel retirement. The goal is to achieve a desired EV market penetration rate (MPR) while enabling the smooth integration of renewables. The nonlinear optimal control problem is solved using the Pontryagin minimum principle. Comprehensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including sensitivity analyses on MPR targets, planning horizons, and cost-benefit considerations. The results offer useful insights for policymakers in designing long-term strategies for EV adoption within a coupled traffic-power system.

J	Chae, M; Kim, T; Won, D				Chae, Myeongseok; Kim, Taesic; Won, Dongjun			Optimal Operation Scheme of Electric Vehicle Routing and Charging Considering Power Distribution and Transportation Integrated System	IEEE ACCESS				Article								The increase in EV (Electric Vehicle) charging demands significantly affects the power system; thus, developing an optimal operating system is necessary to improve the power system stability while considering the transportation network. However, in existing studies, charging scheduling is divided into a power system perspective focusing on grid stability and a transportation perspective focusing on the optimal operation of EVs. As EVs affect both systems, it is necessary to consider both grid operation and transportation-network operation simultaneously. In this study, an integrated operation algorithm for the transportation network and power grid has been developed, which determines the amount of demand response through the power-flow results at the upper level and resolves traffic congestion by setting the optimal route for EVs at the lower level. The Demand Response (DR) adjustment amount is determined based on MATSim vehicle data, rather than simply looking at the DR amount from the perspective of the power system. Furthermore, the concept of Autonomous Integrated EVs (AIEV) in the integrated system has been constructed, which improves the grid stability to cope with uncooperative EVs. The transportation system is configured using MATSim to run the integrated simulation, and the power system is configured using the IEEE-33 bus model. The integrated operating algorithm received high evaluation indicators for voltage stability, power loss, and average driving time. In addition, the effectiveness of the algorithm was demonstrated in various situations through the composition of multiple scenarios.

However, the generation variability and uncertainty of RES, the unpredictable charging schedule of EVs, and access to energy storage systems (ESS) pose significant challenges to the planning, operation, and scheduling of new power systems. Game theory, as a valuable tool for addressing complex subject and multi-objective problems, has been widely applied to tackle these challenges. This work undertakes a comprehensive review of the application of game theory in the planning, operation, and scheduling of new power systems. Through an analysis of 143 research works, the applications of game theory are categorized into three key areas: RES, ESS, and EV charging infrastructure. Moreover, the game theory approaches, payoff/objective functions, players, and strategies used in each study are thoroughly summarized. In addition, the potential for game theory based on artificial intelligence is explored. Lastly, this review discusses existing challenges and offers valuable insights and suggestions for the future research directions.

The aim of the work is to define a set of recommendations in order to guarantee a stable large-scale deployment of EV fleets as primary reserve providers. A realistic fleet model is proposed, which emulates the aggregated response of a number of EVs characterized by V2G hardware response times derived in laboratory tests. The effects of primary frequency control via EV fleets replacing conventional generating units are assessed with a sensitivity study in a single-bus power system with growing fleet sizes and response times. Two recommendations are derived to guarantee safe and stable operation: Recommendation 1 requires the share of EVs providing primary reserve to be smaller than the reserve from conventional units; Recommendation 2 requires response times below a given limit value, calculated as a function of the following power system parameters: the system inertia, the total primary reserve over the rotating generation capacity, and the employed droop gain. The full 60 kV power system of the Danish island of Bornholm is then employed to evaluate the validity of the proposed requirements on a real system with complex dynamics, non-linearities and voltage dependencies.

One way to provide EFR is to use power electronic compensators (PECs) for point-of-load voltage control (PVC) to exploit the voltage dependence of loads. This paper investigates the techno-economic feasibility of such technology in future GB power system by quantifying the total EFR obtainable through deploying PVC in the urban domestic sector, the investment cost of the installment and the economic and environmental benefits of using PVC. The quantification is based on a stochastic domestic demand model and generic medium and low-voltage distribution networks for the urban areas of GB and a stochastic unit commitment (SUC) model with constraints for secure post-fault frequency evolution is used for the value assessment. Two future energy scenarios in the backdrop of 2030 with `smart' and `non-smart' control of electric vehicles and heat pumps, under different levels of penetration of battery energy storage system (BESS) are considered to assess the value of PEC, as well as the associated payback period. It is demonstrated that PVC could effectively complement BESS towards EFR provision in future GB power system.

This demand increment, called Cold Load Pick-up (CLPU) has been a critical concern to utilities and will slow down the restoration process. Thus, it is imperative to predict the CLPU demand to perform restoration process more precisely. The use of new loads such as electric vehicles (EVs) has made new problems. In this paper, first the negative impact of EVs after an outage, on CLPU demand is investigated and then it is shown that the behavior of EVs during restoration service is the same as CLPU phenomenon. In doing so, the proposed approach uses Monte Carlo simulation method to predict EVs recharging demand. Since there will be some other new loads in the future that may have CLPU performance, a new approach is proposed to predict the CLPU demand of any load, without the need to have its exact model. ANFIS method is used to estimate CLPU demand based on previous outage cases in the feeder. The proposed approach is implemented in MATLAB(R) and simulation results confirm its ability in load prediction for restoration service.

However, the increasing adoption of EVs and PVs has introduced unprecedented challenges to the reliability of power systems. The challenge lies in the inherent intermittency associated with solar generation and the uncertainty introduced by the charging load of EVs on the demand side of power grids. Therefore, it is indispensable from the perspective of power system operation and planning to consider the uncertainties associated with the output power of these resources in the reliability assessment framework. This paper develops an electric vehicle load model considering diverse charging station locations, EV types, and drivers' behavior. Also, the proposed method integrates the uncertainty of PV generation through interval prediction utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors regressor. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze the impact of PV interval (forecasted lower and upper generation profile), EV load (hourly and peak), line failures, and demographic characteristics associated with EV on power system reliability. The reliability assessment is extended to sensitivity analysis and evaluation of the impact of EV loads and PV generation profiles on the capacity value of PV generators with different capacities, utilizing the Discrete Convolution approach. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the IEEE Reliability Test System and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in determining the reliability of the power system by explicitly accommodating PV uncertainties and the intricacies of EVs.

J	Kim, G; Hur, J				Kim, Gyeongmin; Hur, Jin			Methodology for Security Analysis of Grid- Connected Electric Vehicle Charging Station With Wind Generating Resources	IEEE ACCESS				Article								The project Carbon-Free Island Jeju by 2030 promoted by the Republic of Korea aims to expand the renewable energy sources centered on wind power in Jeju Island and supply electric vehicles for eco-friendly mobility. However, the increased penetration rate of electric vehicles and expansion of variable renewable energy sources can accelerate the power demand and uncertainty in the power generation output. In this paper, power system analysis is performed through electric vehicle charging demand and wind power outputs prediction, and an electric vehicle charging decentralization algorithm is proposed to mitigate system congestion. In order to predict electric vehicle charging demand, the measurement data were analyzed, and random sampling was performed by applying the weight of charging frequency for each season and time. In addition, wind power outputs prediction was performed using the ARIMAX model. Input variables are wind power measurement data and additional explanatory variables (wind speed). Wind power outputs prediction error (absolute average error) is about 9.6%, which means that the prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm is high. A practical power system analysis was performed for the scenario in which electric vehicle charging is expected to be higher than the wind power generation due to the concentration of electric vehicle charging. The proposed algorithm can be used to analyze power system problems that may occur due to the concentration of electric vehicle charging demand in the future, and to prepare a method for decentralizing electric vehicle charging demand to establish a stable power system operation plan.

The hybrid power system consists of conventional thermal generating units, wind energy generators, solar photovoltaic plants and electric vehicles. An optimal emergency plan has been developed using the coordinated action of slow and fast reserves for the secure power system operation with optimum overall cost. In this paper, we have considered reserves from thermal generators (i.e., spinning reserves), demand-side resources and also the reserves from battery storage. Here, an optimal dynamic and sequential reserve activation plans are developed by using the optimal coordination of fast reserves (i.e., demand-side resources and battery storage) and slow reserves (i.e., spinning reserves). The optimization problem is solved using the MATLAB optimization toolbox (Fmincon function). The effectiveness and suitability of the proposed approach is tested on IEEE 30, 118 and 300 bus test systems.

It targets users who want to study large-scale power grids having only limited information on the actual power system. Besides creating cost minimal PNMs, users are able to flexibly configure the framework to produce PNMs individually tailored to their specific use cases. Both greenfield and expansion planning are possible. The framework further comprises a built-in ac power flow simulation designed to simulate power flows in large-scale networks. This allows users to conduct a great variety of simulation studies on entire power systems, which would otherwise not be possible without access to comprehensive power grid data. Apart from the presentation of the methodology, this work comprises a demonstration of the power system planning process at the example of Singapore. The investigation shows that the framework is capable of generating a network that matches the topological and electrical metrics of the Singapore power grid.

A change such as this will be multifaceted. A power system production cost model (PCM) is a useful tool with which to analyze one of these facets, the operation of the power system. A PCM is a computer simulation that mimics power system operation, i.e., unit commitment, economic dispatch, reserves, etc. To understand how electric vehicles (EVs) will affect power system operation, it is necessary to create models that describe how EVs interact with power system operations that are suitable for use in a PCM. In this work, EV charging data from the EV Project, reported by the Idaho National Laboratory, were used to create scalable, statistical models of EV charging load profiles suitable for incorporation into a PCM. Models of EV loads were created for uncoordinated and coordinated charging. Uncoordinated charging load represents the load resulting from EV owners that charge at times of their choosing. To create an uncoordinated charging load profile, the parameters of importance are the number of vehicles, charger type, battery capacity, availability for charging, and battery beginning and ending states of charge. Coordinated charging is where EVs are charged via an "aggregator" that interacts with a power system operator to schedule EV charging at times that either minimize system operating costs, decrease EV charging costs, or both, while meeting the daily EV charging requirements subject to the EV owners' charging constraints. Beta distributions were found to be the most appropriate distribution for statistically modeling the initial and final state of charge (SoC) of vehicles in an EV fleet. A Monte Carlo technique was implemented by sampling the charging parameters of importance to create an uncoordinated charging load time series. Coordinated charging was modeled as a controllable load within the PCM to represent the influence of the EV fleet on the system's electricity price. The charging models were integrated as EV loads in a simple 5-bus system to demonstrate their usefulness. Polaris Systems Optimization's PCM power system optimizer (PSO) was employed to show the effect of the EVs on one day of operation in the 5-bus power system, yielding interesting and valid results and showing the effectiveness of the charging models.

J	Kamruzzaman, MD; Benidris, M				Kamruzzaman, M. D.; Benidris, Mohammed			Reliability-Based Metrics to Quantify the Maximum Permissible Load Demand of Electric Vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS				Article; Proceedings Paper								The continuous increase of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to introduce several challenges to power systems among which is the deteriorating reliability of power supply. This paper proposes two adequacy metrics to quantify the maximum permissible EV loads for a power system without deteriorating its reliability and the required improvements to power systems to accommodate high penetrations of EVs, which are defined as follows: 1) extra effective available energy for EVs' charging (EEAE-EVs) and 2) extra effective required generation to accommodate EVs (EERG-EVs). The EEAE-EVs provides a measure for the maximum amount of EV loads that a power system can accommodate without adding new generation while maintaining its reliability. The EERG-EVs provides a measure to the minimum amount of new generation that is needed to restore the reliability level of a power system if the load of EVs exceeds the maximum permissible load of the system. These metrics provide a decision aid to power system planners and operators on when and how to perform generation expansion. The importance of the proposed metrics is demonstrated on the IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE RTS) with real EV charging data. The sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is used in evaluating the well known power system reliability indices, the EEAE-EVs, and the EERG-EVs. The results show that a power system can accommodate EV loads without deteriorating its reliability as long as EV loads do not exceed the EEAE-EVs of the system. For the IEEERTS, the EERG-EVs shows that the amount of the required generation to maintain system reliability is about half of the added EV loads from 330-660 MW.	[Kamruzzaman, M.

However, a major concern about electric vehicles is their compatibility with power grids. Adopting a whole-power-system approach, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the impacts and benefits of electric vehicles' diffusion on a national power system, i.e., Italy. Demand and flexibility profiles are estimated with a detailed review of the literature on the topic, allowing us to put forward reliable charging profiles and the resulting flexibility, compatible with the Italian regulatory framework. Distribution network planning and power system dispatching are handled with dedicated models, while the uncertainty associated with EV charging behavior is managed with a Monte Carlo approach. The novelty of this study is considering a nationwide context, considering both transmission and distribution systems, and proposing a set of policies suitable for enabling flexibility provision. The results show that the power and energy demand created by the spread of EVs will have localized impacts on power and voltage limits of the distribution network, while the consequences for transmission grids and dispatching will be negligible. In 2030 scenarios, smart charging reduces grid elements' violations (-23%, -100%), dispatching costs (-43%), and RES curtailment (-50%).

We show that the multiagent optimization problems can be reformulated as a single convex optimization problem and prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium.

This raises the necessity of modeling stochastic and flexible energy resources in power system operation. However, some distributed energy resources have both stochasticity and flexibility, e.g., prosumers with distributed photovoltaics and energy storage, and plug-in electric vehicles with stochastic charging behavior and demand response capability. Such partly controllable participants pose challenges to modeling the aggregate behavior of large numbers of entities in power system operation. This paper proposes a new perspective on the aggregate modeling of such energy resources in power system operation. Specifically, a unified controllability-uncontrollability-decomposed model for various energy resources is established by modeling the controllable and uncontrollable parts of energy resources separately. Such decomposition enables the straightforward aggregate modeling of massive energy resources with different controllabilities by integrating their controllable components with linking constraints and uncontrollable components with dependent discrete convolution. Furthermore, a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model based on the proposed model for power system operation is established. The proposed model is tested using a three-bus system and real Qinghai provincial power grid of China. The result shows that this model is able to characterize at high accuracy the aggregate behavior of massive energy resources with different levels of controllability so that their flexibility can be fully explored.

The existing literature has examined the impact of extreme events on power system planning. However, few studies have systematically explored the role of large-scale electric vehicle (EV) fleets toward grid resilience enhancement in EWEs. Therefore, we propose a resilience-oriented power system planning method considering vehicle-to-grid (V2G) coordination, especially amidst blizzard events. A blizzard-induced grid failure model is established for long-term N-K contingency scenario generation, followed by a two-stage generation expansion and line hardening optimization considering both normal and contingency conditions. Three charging modes of EV fleets, i.e., plug and play (PnP), orderly charging (V1G) and V2G, are compared. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, using 2024 data from the Jibei region of northern China and two extreme blizzard scenarios, demonstrate that combining resilience-oriented planning with V2G coordination significantly reduces total system costs by 58.02% compared to the baseline, achieving the lowest total cost of $2.48 x 103 million. Furthermore, the integrated approach reduces load shedding cost by 87.74% and 77.95% compared to considering only EV coordination or only resilience planning, respectively. These findings highlight the value and novelty of integrating EV flexibility into long-term resilience-oriented power system planning.

As of July 2023, India's power system has seen a rapid transformation, with renewable energy, including large hydro, accounting for 40% of the total installed capacity at 177 GW. The ongoing energy transition has not only changed the country's energy mix but also brought new challenges for system operators. The primary challenge is frequency instability due to the reduction of system inertia and governor-based primary frequency response (PFR) availability by large-scale integration of uncertain renewable energy resources (RES) such as wind and solar photovoltaic generators. Furthermore, the absence of frequency control ancillary services market, inadequate penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and uncertainty of RES generation enhance the complexity of the frequency response services in the Indian power system. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the frequency response challenges of the future low-carbon Indian power system and underlines the new potential fast frequency response (FFR) services from advanced energy storage and renewable generation technologies. Such FFR services can be swiftly deployed in low-inertia grids through the integration of energy storage systems and inverter-based resources in a shorter span. Modeling of FFR services in security constraint unit commitment (SCUC) can enhance grid resiliency and facilitate high penetration of RES in the Indian power system without loss of frequency stability.

Relying on day-ahead power market planning has limitations in addressing the volatility caused by RESs, resulting in unnecessary reserve capacity consumption. The optimal utilization of flexible resources, including Energy Storage Systems (ESSs), is crucial to tackle these issues. Economic Dispatch (ED) plays a vital role in power system operation and planning, which has become even more significant with the growth of RESs and the widespread adoption of EVs. It introduces dynamic loads due to varying user behaviors, posing operational challenges for the power system. The integration of EVs into the grid through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology is becoming increasingly important.

We propose a stochastic linear programming framework to study long-term investments under uncertain short-term operations of nationally aggregated assets. We apply the model to a case study assuming European power sector decarbonization towards 2060 according to a 1.5 degree scenario, and we investigate the impact of coupling building heat systems and electric vehicle charging in Norway with the European power market. The case study focuses on the role of Norway in a European perspective because: (1) Norwegian electricity production is mainly based on flexible and renewable hydropower, (2) Norwegian building heating systems are currently mainly electric, and (3) Norway is already introducing electric vehicles at large. We focus on the European power market to test our hypothesis that it is more cost-efficient to decarbonize when the central power system is coordinated with building heat systems and electric vehicle charging. For Europe as a whole, results show that the average European electricity cost reduces by 3% and transmission expansion decreases by 0.4% when Norwegian heat systems are developed in coordination with the European power system. The average Norwegian electricity cost decreases by 19%. The strategy includes supplying up to 20% of Norwegian buildings with district heating fueled by waste and biomass, and the remaining electric heating supply is dominated by heat pumps.

However, the fuel cell of the hybrid power system has a critical drawback of short lifetime. For this reason, the development of the energy management strategy considering power sources degradation becomes significant and urgent. In addition, the power system configuration has a strong link with the control strategy. In this vein, a sizing method of the hybrid energy storage system for a fuel cell hybrid excursion ferry is proposed to prolong the fuel cell lifetime. Based on the configuration of the power system, a real-time optimization control strategy considering efficiency and durability is developed. To verify the control strategy, the mathematical model of the hybrid power system is established.

Optimal scheduling of distributed battery storage for enhancing the security and the economics of electric power systems with emission constraints	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								In this paper, the sustainable day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems with the integration of distributed energy storage devices is investigated. The main objective is to minimize the hourly power system operation cost with a cleaner, socially responsible, and sustainable generation of electricity. Emission constraints are enforced to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional thermal generating units. The stationary electric vehicles (EV) are considered as an example of distributed storage and vehicle to grid (V2G) technology is considered to demonstrate the bilateral role of EV as supplier and consumer of energy. Battery storage can ease the impact of variability of renewable energy sources on power system operations and reduce the impact of thermal generation emission at peak hours. We model the day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems as a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem for solving the hourly security-constraint unit commitment (SCUC). In order to expedite the real-time solution for large-scale power systems, we consider a two-stage model of the hourly SCUC by applying the Benders decomposition (BD). The Benders decomposition would separate the hourly generation unit commitment (UC) in the master problem from the power network security check in subproblem. The subproblem would check dc network security constraints for the given UC solution to determine whether a converged and secure dc power flow can be obtained. If any power network violations arise, corresponding Benders cuts are formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will continue until the network violations are eliminated and a converged hourly solution is found for scheduling the power generating units. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MILP approach and its potentials as an optimization tool for sustainable operations of electric power grids.

Security-constrained power generation scheduling with thermal generating units, variable energy resources, and electric vehicle storage for V2G deployment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								This paper investigates the role of integration of distributed storage with high penetration of variable renewable sources in power systems. The paper analyzes the impact of such integrations on the security, emission reduction, and the economic operation of electric power systems. The paper also identifies strategies for a larger penetration of variable generation resources without compromising the power system security. Mixed integer linear programing (MILP) is applied for the optimization of the day-ahead hourly security-constrained unit commitment. The assimilation of EVs (both as a provider and a utilizer of energy), renewable energy sources, and smart grid is regarded as a novel, low-cost, and low-emission solution to the existing challenges of electric power systems including the means of storing large quantities of energy considering variable renewable energy sources and large carbon footprints of conventional thermal units. Numerical studies are conducted in this paper to showcase the potential impacts of EV fleets as battery storage for peak load shaving, minimizing power grid operation costs and hourly wind curtailments, and optimizing the environmental impacts based on hourly commitment and dispatch of thermal generating units.

In this paper, a coordinated solution for stochastic security constrained unit commitment-traffic assignment problem (SCUC-TAP) is proposed in which stochastic SCUC is used to model the power grid operation with large-scale renewable energy integration, and TAP is used to model the constrained traffic network. The impact of the departure time of commuting EVs on mitigating the congestion in PTN is analyzed based on the proposed model. A heuristic algorithm using Benders decomposition is proposed in which the traffic plan is introduced for decoupling the proposed SCUC-TAP while utilizing the existing software packages of TAP and stochastic SCUC. Two case studies including a 6-bus power system with 9 nodes and 24 directed links traffic network and an IEEE 118-bus system with three independent urban traffic network are used to simulate various scenarios in the coupled networks of power and transportation. The simulation results show that by introducing a flexible EV charge/travel schedule, the power system generation and delivery costs can be further reduced in which most EV users gain from the optimization of transportation, charge/discharge, and power system delivery schedules.

While traditional approaches of assigning conventional generation units to maintain system stability can increase operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, or give signals for new investments, utilizing intelligent control of distributed sources might mitigate those negative effects. This can he achieved by controllable charging of domestic electric vehicles. On the other hand, increasing number of public charging stations gives final users the opportunity to fast charge, making their vehicles an additional source of uncertainty rather than a provider of flexibility. This paper brings a full system assessment of combined effect of slow home charging of electric vehicles together with fast charging stations (both with and without integrated energy storage systems), cast as mixed integer linear programming unit commitment model. The contributions of this paper look into optimal periods when fast charging is beneficial for the system operation, as well as assess the benefits of integrating battery storage into fast charging stations to mitigate the negative effects to power system operation.

J	Kitamura, T; Kubo, T; Kondoh, J				Kitamura, Takeru; Kubo, Toshiki; Kondoh, Junji			Demonstration of Frequency Regulation via Autonomous Load Control	IEEE ACCESS				Article								With the increasing proliferation of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power globally, frequency regulation by balancing generation and load in power systems is becoming increasingly difficult owing to reductions in dispatchable power and inertia. One countermeasure is autonomous load control, in which thermostatic loads and electric vehicle chargers quickly adjust the power consumption based on the grid frequency monitored by themselves without communication. However, testing the impact of such load controls on the frequency in actual power systems is too expensive. Therefore, a laboratory-scale isolated power system was prepared as a test bed to examine autonomous load control based on the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and the frequency deviation to cope with steep frequency fluctuations. Moreover, the experimental system was simulated numerically using MATLAB/Simulink. The experimental and simulation results are comparable, indicating that the simulation can be used to determine the total capacity and threshold when planning the introduction of autonomous control loads. The experimental and simulation results also show that frequency fluctuations can be mitigated by introducing autonomous control loads to the grid, and the response time can be improved by approximately 1 s by controlling the load based on the RoCoF.

As the share of power generated from wind energy continues to increase due to environmental concerns and to reduce carbon footprints, the case study proposed is designing an effective wind energy system for a smart building environment to reduce the burden on the grid. Incorporating wind energy systems into grid-connected buildings increases the reliability of the microgrid system for smart building environments. Applying smart techniques with integrated automation in the built environment can play a key role in decreasing peak demand for load development in smart cities. This can also enhance the overall efficiency of power grids, reduce waste, and enable the effective use of energy resources. Furthermore, researchers are finding new ways to collect energy from renewable sources and power-built environments due to dwindling fossil fuel resources and increased environmental awareness. The analysis of wind-connected power systems has been initiated to satisfy the increasing demand for reliable supply systems by consumers. This has prompted the use of wind energy systems with controlled techniques to enhance the reliability of power systems and reduce carbon footprints generated by fossil fuel-based power systems. Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to understand the economic prospects of wind energy sources for smart building environments, reliability analysis of wind energy sources-based power systems, reduce carbon footprints, and balance power demand through wind energy systems. The Progressive Wind Model Taylor-Sequence Proliferation (PWMTSP) and Innovative Six Parameters Based Progressive Beta Creative Model (ISPBPBCM) approaches are proposed to understand the reliability of wind energy-based power systems in smart building environments. The work also provides an economic analysis of the proposed low-cost wind power system with different capacities for residential consumers in selected geographic location. Eight cases are considered for the proposed effective wind energy system for smart building environments ranging from 2 MW to 32 MW. Hence, the economic analysis of the proposed systems is discussed for residential users. All eight cases are eco-friendly and reduce carbon emissions as these generated units from wind energy sources need not be purchased from fossil fuel-based plants, which increases the reliability of the proposed system. The expected energy not supplied (EENS) in the planned work increases as wind power capacity increases. Loss of load expectation (LOLE), loss of load probability (LOLP), and failure rate all decrease with the installation of more wind power systems. Moreover, it can be seen that mean time to repair (MTTR) improves when wind energy capacity rises incrementally from 2 MW to 32 MW. The proposed progressive wind model Taylor-sequence proliferation (PWMTSP) improves MTTR while increasing the wind power capacity from 4.8 to 13.8. The value of MTTR rises from 5.2 to 14.7 with the novel six parameter progressive beta creative model (ISPBPBCM). The proposed method is anticipated to be adaptable to various types of wind energy systems where dependability is a crucial component of system design and scalable to large wind integrated power systems.

If the power system involves battery-swap stations of electric vehicles, it is difficult to ensure the data security during the distributed scheduling. To solve the problem, this paper sets up a collaborative optimization model for distributed scheduling based on blockchain consensus mechanism, considering the battery-swap stations. The power system was divided into three levels: the transmission network level, the distribution network level and the battery-swap station level. Next, the objective functions were constructed to minimize the generation cost and daily load variance on each level, and the optimal scheduling plan for the power system was solved through multi-level collaborative optimization. The blockchain consensus mechanism was adopted to verify the accuracy of the transaction data, and the production data of all entities were encoded by hash function before storage, such that the data are tamper resistant and traceable. The example analysis shows that our model can effectively reduce the generation cost, lower the daily load variance, and enhance system stability. The research findings shed new light on maintaining the optimization efficiency and data confidentiality of modern power network.

J	Ny, D; Jeenanunta, C				Ny, Dino; Jeenanunta, Chawalit			Optimizing Power System Reliability and Carbon Emissions With a Fuzzy Unit Commitment Model Incorporating Renewable Energy, Load Forecast Errors, EV Charging, and Energy Storage System	IEEE ACCESS				Article								The increasing use of Renewable Energy (RE), the influence of forecasted load error, and Electric Vehicles (EVs) add significant uncertainty and variables to power system Unit Commitment (UC) planning. For addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a Fuzzy Mathematical Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMMILP) approach for daily UC that incorporates the scheduling of Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) and Battery Energy Storage (BES) to manage supply and demand fluctuations. The FMMILP model explicitly considers these uncertainties and aims to minimize total production cost and carbon emissions while ensuring reliable and sustainable power system operation. The effective solution method for solving FMMILP is explained. The FMMILP model is applied to Thailand's national power system, characterized by its diverse generation mix, substantial RES penetration, and growing EV adoption. A comprehensive stochastic reliability analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation is performed, incorporating a wide range of supply and demand scenarios, including extreme worst-case scenarios, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models. These scenarios incorporate optimal solutions from UC and RES dispatch patterns. Three distinct FMMILP models are compared against a deterministic UC benchmark in the rainy, summer, and winter seasons. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the FMMILP model achieves optimal solutions within acceptable computational time and significantly enhances system reliability compared to the deterministic model, with reliability improvements of 15.99%, 26.14%, and 51.44% in the rainy season, summer season, and winter season, respectively. This is evidenced by the reduction in the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) in power system operation.

Its main goals are to meet growing electricity demand, ensure system reliability, and maintain economic efficiency. However, recent changes in the energy sector-such as the rapid growth of renewable energy, the push for decarbonisation, and the rise of electric vehicles-have introduced new challenges and uncertainties for TEP. This paper reviews more than 150 research articles to explore how these trends are reshaping TEP. We identify key insights, emerging challenges, and research gaps, emphasizing the need for improved tools and approaches to address the complexities of modern power systems. Finally, we discuss the need for research in TEP to incorporate uncertainties like energy storage systems (ESS), electric vehicle adoption, and high renewable energy integration, using advanced algorithms and real-world data to enhance accuracy and relevance.

J	Dagteke, SE; Unal, S				Dagteke, Suleyman Emre; Unal, Sencer			Design of an Electric Vehicle Charging System Consisting of PV and Fuel Cell for Historical and Tourist Regions	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								One of the most important problems in the widespread use of electric vehicles is the lack of charging infrastructure. Especially in tourist areas where historical buildings are located, the installation of a power grid for the installation of electric vehicle charging stations or generating electrical energy by installing renewable energy production systems such as large-sized PV (photovoltaic) and wind turbines poses a problem because it causes the deterioration of the historical texture. Considering the need for renewable energy sources in the transportation sector, our aim in this study is to model an electric vehicle charging station using PVPS (photovoltaic power system) and FC (fuel cell) power systems by using irradiation and temperature data from historical regions. This designed charging station model performs electric vehicle charging, meeting the energy demand of a house and hydrogen production by feeding the electrolyzer with the surplus energy from producing electrical energy with the PVPS during the daytime. At night, when there is no solar radiation, electric vehicle charging and residential energy demand are met with an FC power system. One of the most important advantages of this system is the use of hydrogen storage instead of a battery system for energy storage and the conversion of hydrogen into electrical energy with an FC. Unlike other studies, in our study, fossil energy sources such as diesel generators are not included for the stable operation of the system. The system in this study may need hydrogen refueling in unfavorable climatic conditions and the energy storage capacity is limited by the hydrogen fuel tank capacity.

However, EV charging may also impose significant investment requirement for the power system that needs to be analyzed carefully including the capacity of the existing distribution network system, investments needed in solar PV together with battery storage and additional diesel capacity to meet the incremental demand from EVs. We explore an EV adoption scenario for Maldives for 2030 with 30% of all vehicles including two-wheelers that dominate the transport on the island under two different charging regimes: uncoordinated and optimized coordinated mode. The latter is achieved through a system wide optimization using a modified version of the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM) that optimizes charging load subject to a range of constraints on allowable timing for different categories of vehicles. If charging from the fleet is uncoordinated, a relatively small increase in energy requirement of 3.1% due to EV may lead to a 26.1% increase in generation capacity requirement and hence 15.7% additional investment. While the optimized charging regime helps to drastically cut down on generation capacity requirements to just 1.8% increase and also considerably eases feeder loading, it may also lead to higher emissions as more EV load during off-peak hours lead to an increase in diesel-based generation. We have therefore explored an additional scenario wherein the annual emissions from the power sector are constrained to the baseline ("No EV") scenario. The analysis shows the importance of focused modeling analysis to understand the ramifications of EV load impact on the power system including significant increase in generation capacity and potential increase in power sector emissions in a fossil-fuel dominated system.

In this paper, a partial decomposition method which is based on the Lagrangian relaxation framework is proposed for the EV charging control in transmission-constrained power systems. The partial decomposition method helps reduce the number of dual multipliers and stabilize the iterative process. The proposed partial decomposition framework is applied to a day-ahead SCUC algorithm which can be easily implemented in the existing hierarchical power system operations. The proposed EV charging control method can not only help reduce the total generation cost of power systems but also alleviate the transmission grid congestion. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the case studies applied to the modified IEEE-RTS1979.

J	Forestieri, JN; Farasat, M				Nunez Forestieri, Juan; Farasat, Mehdi			Energy flow control and sizing of a hybrid battery/supercapacitor storage in MVDC shipboard power systems	IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION				Article								The propulsion system of a medium-voltage dc (MVDC) ship is subject to large thrust/torque variations due to interactions of the ship and the propeller with sea waves. These variations induce steep power fluctuations on the MVDC bus, adversely impacting the stability, efficiency and power quality. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is a promising solution for mitigating these power fluctuations. Dictating the energy that the HESS components must deliver/absorb, the energy management strategy (EMS) impacts the size/capacity of the energy storage system (ESS). Based on this consideration, sizing and EMS of a battery/supercapacitor (SC) HESS are jointly optimised by using a deep reinforcement learning-based method. The proposed method splits the power between the HESS components such that while the operational constraints are satisfied, energy storage size and losses are minimised. Its features are adaptability to varying sea states, real-time implementation feasibility, while obviating the requirement for knowledge of the ship propulsion power profile. The efficacy of the joint sizing/EMS on reducing the ESS size is validated by comparing the sizes when battery-only, SC-only and HESS are employed in the MVDC shipboard power system. Real-time implementation feasibility and adaptability to various ship propulsion power profiles is confirmed through real-time simulations.

This article proposes a new data-driven approach for EV charging load modeling. We first introduce a mathematical model that characterizes the flexibility of EV charging demand. Advanced simulation procedures are then proposed to identify the parameters of different EV load models and simulate EV charging demand under different electricity market realizations. The proposed EV load modeling approach can simulate different EV operation schedules, charging levels, and customer participation as a benchmark system. The proposed framework will also provide informative guidelines to transmission system operators for EV charging infrastructure planning in modern power systems.

Assessing the impacts of energy storage on the electricity market-clearing algorithms	INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								This work presents a generic optimization framework based on linear Mixed Integer Programming to assess energy storage options' influence on the operational scheduling and the economic performance of a given power system with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources. In particular, three power markets-clearing algorithms with different order types and modeling of technical characteristics have been developed, including energy storage devices and cross-border trading capabilities as additional flexibility sources. A representative case study of the future Greek power system in 2030 with an hourly time span has been utilized to assess the developed framework's applicability. Several case studies have been studied to quantify the impacts of the market-clearing procedure and the electricity storage capacity. The results highlight the improvements in the power system due to the utilization of energy storage in terms of the system's operational cost, operational scheduling through the provision of ramping capabilities, environmental impact, and increased renewables' utilization. Energy storage has to be considered in an integrated way along with other flexibility providers (electric vehicles, interconnections, demand response, and flexible generation) to achieve synergies and fully exploit its contributions.

Day-ahead charging operation of electric vehicles with on-site renewable energy resources in a mixed integer linear programming framework	IET SMART GRID				Article								The large-scale penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the power system will provoke new challenges needed to be handled by distribution system operators (DSOs). Demand response (DR) strategies play a key role in facilitating the integration of each new asset into the power system. With the aid of the smart grid paradigm, a day-ahead charging operation of large-scale penetration of EVs in different regions that include different aggregators and various EV parking lots (EVPLs) is propounded in this study. Moreover, the uncertainty of the related EV owners, such as the initial state-of-energy and the arrival time to the related EVPL, is taken into account. The stochasticity of PV generation is also investigated by using a scenario-based approach related to daily solar irradiation data. Last but not least, the operational flexibility is also taken into consideration by implementing peak load limitation (PLL) based DR strategies from the DSO point of view. To reveal the effectiveness of the devised scheduling model, it is performed under various case studies that have different levels of PLL, and for the cases with and without PV generation.

The increasing of EV utilization in transportation sector and renewable energy integration, such as, PV panel, in local power grid exacerbates system frequency fluctuation. Regulation of system frequency deviation by EV battery storage charging/discharging is a crucial issue for the time being. In this article, a power grid model with a high proportion of PV power is constructed, numerical simulation using time series data is carried out to observe the contribution of the charging/discharging control of aggregated EV group to vehicle to grid (V2G) system frequency regulation. By this way, constructive suggestions are given for the development of charging stations and EV charging/discharging plan, so that the transportation system and power system can be better coordinated and integrated.

J	Kazemtarghi, A; Dey, S; Mallik, A				Kazemtarghi, Abed; Dey, Saikat; Mallik, Ayan			Optimal Utilization of Bidirectional EVs for Grid Frequency Support in Power Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY				Article								Bidirectional onboard chargers introduce electric vehicles (EVs) as flexible actors in the power grids that can operate in grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) modes. Despite the benefits of the bidirectional EVs in the event of grid contingencies, they may have adverse impacts on the normal operation of the power systems. This article investigates the impacts of bidirectional EVs on power quality, voltage profile, and frequency stability of the power grid. For this purpose, a detailed model of practical bidirectional onboard charger is presented to measure the total harmonic distortion (THD) in the grid current caused by the EVs. The proposed study accounts for various EV power levels, grid voltage levels, and EV modes of operation. Furthermore, an optimal frequency support strategy is developed that takes advantage of available EVs in V2G mode to improve the frequency stability of the grid in the event of frequency fluctuations. The effects of bidirectional EVs on the voltage profile is also explored by implementing current summation method (CSM)-derived power flow analysis for IEEE 33-Bus radial distribution system. The results show that with an optimal planning of EVs, it is possible to improve voltage profile and frequency stability of the grid while the power quality of the grid is maintained in the allowed range according to the IEEE 519-2014 standard.

Placement of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) is crucial to fulfilling the charging demand at different locations maintaining the minimum negative impact on the power system network. In this article, placement of EVCS has been planned in a radial distribution network superimposed with a road network. The weightage for different places have been considered as per charging demand which depends on the supermarket, road junctions, residences etc. The objectives are minimization of the energy loss, voltage deviation of the power system network and minimization of the land cost with maximum weightage to serve maximum EV with minimum establishment cost. The area has been divided into three zones to establish an EVCS at each zone to make it distributed. Uncertainties related to EV have been considered in this work using 2m Point Estimation method (2m PEM). The optimization problem has been solved using Differential Evolution (DE) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) techniques. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One of the most significant impacts is the extreme load valley caused by "consistency"in off-grid actions of EVs automatically finishing their charging, which normally occurs at night. The dramatic load reduction at limited period not only leads to security problem of power system due to the deficiency of downward reserve in generation side, but also forces the thermal units to operate in the extremely uneconomical deep peak regulation (DPR) state. To address this issue, a coordinated optimization strategy considering nighttime DPR state of units and uncertain EV demand response (DR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, unlike traditional studies, a detailed unit commitment (UC) model considering life loss and oil cost is established in this paper. After that, on the basis of elastic pricing method and day-ahead contract, price-based demand response (PDR) and incentive-based demand response (IDR) model are proposed to avoid units operating in the DPR state. The uncertainty of both IDR and PDR progress are considered as a whole in the form of opportunity constrain, and then transformed into deterministic linear constraints for solving by adopting sequence operations. Finally, various cases are simulated in the improved IEEE 30-bus system, the results indicate that the presented coordinated optimization strategy can reduce the units' operating cost effectively, as well as bring benefits to EV owners.

Furthermore, the randomly connected EVs at different time periods and locations add more uncertainty to the power system. In this study, uncertainties in wind power generation and EV charging load are modelled into the day-ahead dynamic economic dispatch (DED) problem, solution feasibility and robustness are discussed, and the bad scenario set is formulated for the day-ahead DED problem. In the obtained model, parameters can be used to adjust the positive bias or conservative bias, charging/discharging power of battery switch stations are also controlled to optimise the total cost of power system. To solve the optimisation problem, the multi-agent bacterial colony chemotaxis algorithm and a mutation strategy based on the cloud theory are developed. The simulation results show that the proposed method is effective, and battery switching station can help to reduce total cost by charging and discharging batteries.

By considering the environmental and economic problems, the application of EVs as a proper charging/discharging scheduling model and green energy sources plays an important role in the power system. This study focuses on multicriteria scheduling through uncertainty factors via inexhaustible assets and EVs, presenting a battery storing framework and reducing both the operation costs and the amount of the framework's pollution while improving the procedures. For this purpose, a new optimization algorithm has been considered to address the mentioned problem taking into account some clean energy sources and emission. The proposed model is examined in smart grid environment based on real-life model by Demand Response Program (DRP) evaluation and the uncertainties in sustainable energies. The proposed optimization algorithm shows more desirable results in comparison with other models, while the efficiency of the suggested approach is studied and evaluated in two power systems, i.e., a 33-bus standard power system and a 94-bus Portugal network.

J	Alaei, MH; Latify, MA				Alaei, Mohammad Hosein; Latify, Mohammad Amin			Dynamic investment planning of CVR implementation considering PEVs' reactive power compensation capability	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				Article								Conservation voltage reduction (CVR) is a strategy that tries to save energy consumption by managing consumers' voltage. On the other hand, enhancing reactive power compensation in the power system gives rise to CVR implementation more effectively. This paper addresses how the power system planner could encourage investment to establish the above-mentioned topics. Here, a model for encouraging industrial loads to dynamically invest in implementing the CVR strategy over the planning horizon is presented. To make CVR implementation more efficient, investment in upgrading plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) chargers to be utilized as reactive power compensators is also considered. Industrial loads benefit from saving in their electricity bills and incentive payments that might be paid by utilities (if necessary). The objective function of the proposed planning model is to maximize the energy-saving of industrial loads and to minimize incentive payment by electric utilities over the planning horizon. This objective is achieved subject to that the investment plan is economically feasible. Moreover, power system operation constraints in the planning horizon based on AC power flow equations and voltage-dependent load models are considered. The proposed planning problem is modelled as a non-linear optimization problem that can be solved by off-the-shelf software, for example, GAMS. The proposed model is applied to the Ontario transmission system. The numerical results show the proposed model's effectiveness in designing an investment plan for industrial loads to implement the CVR strategy and upgrade PEVs' chargers.

A Survey of Open-Source Tools for Transmission and Distribution Systems Research	IEEE ACCESS				Article								This work presents a review of open-source electric power transmission and distribution systems analysis tools suitable for use by industry professionals and academic researchers. Due to the high complexity of the electric grid, there exist numerous tools and extensive research pertaining to nearly every aspect of the design, operation, and control of transmission and distribution networks. In addition to the commercial tools, a wide range of free, open-source tools, models, and data usable by the scientific community for related research have been developed by different organizations, including both international and US universities and national laboratories. However, due to the absence of a catalog of available tools, models and data, researchers often lack a knowledge of existing capabilities and may develop duplicative software and tools. Increasing awareness of these available resources seeks to accelerate their broader use, leading to more efficient and standardized grid analysis. This review paper (which is part of a larger survey effort that studied over 400 tools in the transmission, distribution, buildings, and electric vehicles space) outlines selected open-source resources that have been developed in power transmission and distribution systems research. It is anticipated that this work can serve as a guide for industry and academic researchers alike, ensuring that research efforts are well-channeled.

To quantify the temporal and spatial flexibility of EVs for charging and discharging, a novel dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem is proposed. The DTA problem is based on a link transmission model (LTM) with extended charging links, depicting the interaction between EVs and power systems. It models the charging rates as continuous variables by an energy boundary model. To consider the evacuation requirements of TNs and the uncertainties of traffic conditions, the DTA problem is extended to a two-stage distributionally robust version. It is further incorporated into a two-stage distributionally robust unit commitment problem to balance the enhancement of EPNs and the performance of TNs. The problem is reformulated into a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved by off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Case studies are performed on two test networks. The effectiveness is verified by the numerical results, e.g., reducing the load shedding amount without increasing the unmet traffic demand.

Congestion gradually violates the physical, operational and policy constraints of the present electricity market. Congestion management in huge power system remains a challenging and tough task, which can be achieved by introducing one or more Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as Distributed Generation (DG), electric vehicles, modern micro grid, Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) etc. over congested lines. Consequently, this work proposes the hourly congestion management by optimal allocation of DG in '24 hours' time frame. Further, Transmission Congestion Rent is used to determine the optimal and sub optimal locations for DG, whereas Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization based hybrid optimization technique is exploited to identify optimal DG size. In this work, solar based DG along with battery based ESS is considered to act as Distributed Energy Storage System 'DESS. Subsequently, Interval computation method is introduced in this work to consider the intermittency of solar DG. Battery Energy Storage System 'BESS' is integrated with DGs due to its excess energy storage capability during off-load period and make it available at peak load conditions, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the network. The '24 hours' solar irradiance and temperature data of Delhi, India is taken into account to mathematically model the power generated from Solar DG. The proposed methodology is tested on IEEE 30-bus system and '24 hours' demand data is generated from the original IEEE load data. From the obtained results, it has been established that the hybrid optimization technique results into a better solution as compared to their individual enforcement in managing available generation resources and congestion problem.

The flexibility and reliability of the optimal resource expansion planning are ensured by means of appropriate constraints incorporated into the proposed planning tool where thermal generation units, ES systems, and DR programs are considered as flexibility resources. The proposed planning tool is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem due to the non-linear and non-convex constraints of AC power flow equations. Accordingly, to linearise the proposed MINLP problem, the AC nodal power balance constraints are linearised by means of the first-order expansion of Taylor's series and the line flow equations are linearised by means of a polygon. Additionally, the stochastic programming is used to characterise the uncertainty of loads, a maximum available power of wind farms, forecasted energy price, and availability/unavailability of generation units and transmission lines by means of a sufficient number of scenarios.

The proposed model contains a two objective problem that the first objective function minimizes the construction and operation costs of resiliency sources (RSs) and, in the second objective function, the minimization of the expected energy not supplied (EENS) due to the outage of the system against the mentioned natural disasters is formulated. Also, the proposed model is constrained to linearized AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equations, the planning and operating of RSs constraints such as generation units, hardening transmission lines, parallel and series FACTS devices, resiliency constraints and power system angular stability against earthquakes and floods in the presence of critical and non-critical loads. In order to achieve the best compromise response, the RCGTEP single-objective problem is formulated based on the epsilon constraint-based Pareto optimization. In addition, this model has the uncertainty of RSs availability against natural disasters, so stochastic programming is used for RCGTEP. Then, the Benders decomposition (BD) method is used to solve the proposed problem and achieve the optimal solution in the shortest possible time. Finally, by implementing the proposed model on an IEEE standard transmission network, the numerical results confirm the capability of this method in improving the economic, operation, angular stability and resiliency indices of the power system simultaneously.

It has become an irreversible trend to replace traditional fossil fuels with advanced energy storage technology. However, an improper energy management leads to not only energy waste but also undesired costs and emissions. Accordingly, the authors develop a two-layer shipboard energy management framework. In the initial stage, a shipboard navigation planning problem is formulated that considers battery state estimation and is subsequently solved using particle swarm optimisation to obtain an optimal speed trajectory. To track the scheduled speed, a reinforcement learning method based on a deep Q-Network is proposed in the second stage to realise real-time energy management of the diesel generator and energy storage system. This approach ensures that the state of charge remains within a safe range and that the performance is improved, avoiding excessive discharge from the energy storage systems and further enhancing the efficiency. The numerical results demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Pandit, D; Pandit, D; Nguyen, N				Pandit, Deepak; Pandit, Dilip; Nguyen, Nga			Reliability Assessment of Power Systems in the Presence of Large-Scale Electric Vehicle Integration	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS				Article								The rising environmental concerns and depletion of fossil fuels have promoted the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into modern power grids. EVs can serve either as a load or storage, presenting a dual-faceted challenge to power system planning and operation. As a result, there is a growing need for comprehensive reliability assessment in the presence of EVs. This paper proposes improved reliability assessment frameworks for systems with large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) operating in battery exchange (BE) and plug-in modes. Initially, a reliability model for BE electric vehicles (BEVs) is formulated using a time-series aggregated EV user load profile, BE station operation strategy, and off-peak battery exchange mode of BEVs. Additionally, a random-sampling-based operational algorithm is developed for plug-in EVs (PEVs), considering their charging, discharging, and grid support modes. A composite reliability assessment framework is then developed, incorporating an optimization model that accounts for the aggregated operations of BEVs and PEVs. The effect of EVs on the system reliability is assessed using the mixed-timing sequential Monte Carlo simulation on the IEEE RTS-79 and the RTS-GMLC systems. Simulation results show that up to 18% improvement in reliability indices is achieved with a 15% penetration of BEVs operating in off-peak mode. Also, the same penetration of PEVs with grid-support modes yields up to 14% improvement in system reliability. Finally, the impacts of BEV and PEV integration on the loading and reliability of transmission lines and power transformers are analyzed.

This article investigates the prospects of implementing hydrogen P2G technology in coupling the power system and the transportation system. A novel coordinated long-term planning model of integrated power and transportation system (IPTS) at the regional scale is proposed to simulate the power system balance and travel demand balance simultaneously, while subject to a series of constraints, such as CO2 emission constraints. IPTS of Texas was investigated considering various CO2 emission cap scenarios. Results show unique decarbonization trajectories of the proposed coordinated planning model, in which IPTS prefers to decarbonizing the power sector firstly. When the power system reaches ultralow carbon intensity, the IPTS then focuses on the road transportation system decarbonization. The results show that with the P2G system, IPTS of Texas could achieve 100% CO2 emission reductions (relative 2018 emissions level) by adding a combination of approximately 143.5 GW of wind, 50 GW of solar PV, and 40 GW of P2G systems with 2.5% renewables curtailment. The integration of the P2G system can produce hydrogen by use of surplus RES generation to meet hydrogen demand of Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and to meet multiday electricity supply imbalances.

That is, PEV driving and charging behavior will influence the two networks simultaneously. This paper studies optimal planning of PEV fast-charging stations considering the interactions between the transportation and electrical networks. The geographical targeted planning area is a highway transportation network powered by a high voltage distribution network. First, we propose the capacitated-flow refueling location model (CFRLM) to explicitly capture PEV charging demands on the transportation network under driving range constraints. Then, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated for PEV fast-charging station planning considering both transportation and electrical constraints based on CFRLM, which can be solved by deterministic branch-and-bound methods. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the proposed planning method. The influences of PEV population, power system security operation constraints, and PEV range are analyzed.

However, PEVs growth is moderate owing to range anxiety of drivers. In this context, fast charging stations (FCSs) deployment is an emerging development to lower the range anxiety of drivers. Though, heavy deployment of PEVs has up-surged the need of load demand on power systems. This requires a coordinated operation between power systems and future transportation systems to meet their demands. The FCS investors have keen interest in the net present value (NPV) of the project. On the other hand, the utility wants to keep its peak demand within the limits to ensure the safe-operation. This creates a contradiction between the FCS investor and utility' objectives. Thus, this paper proposes an analytical approach for traffic-based multi-stage planning of FCS that aids FCS investor by considering PEV traffic, staggered investments, convenience of PEV drivers, profit on investments, and capacity limit of FCS imposed by the utility. The formulation for NPV is modified to account the revenue incurred owing to staggered investments. Proposed methodology determines a set of few sub-solutions constrained by mean service time of PEVs. This facilitates FCS investor to select the planning solution on the basis of his/her satisfaction. Detailed investigation of the proposed methodology highlights the applications and importance on assessing the FCS investors' concerns while considering the affecting factors of transportation system, power system, drivers' concerns, and profit margins altogether.

The paper investigates the impact of such integrations for enhancing the environmental sustainability, social sustainability, and economic operation of electric power systems. The goal is to keep the energy sector on track for addressing the 2 degree Celsius (2DC) target per Copenhagen climate agreement. 1 The paper identifies strategies for large-scale integration of variable generation resources without compromising the electricity infrastructure security. The power system uncertainties pertaining to hourly load and wind energy forecast errors, and random outages of generation and transmission components are taken into consideration in Monte Carlo scenarios. The stochastic optimization of day-ahead hourly scheduling of electricity is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. The merits of the proposed optimization model are demonstrated by applying four numerical case studies. The conclusion is that the applications of renewable energy resources and the intelligent assimilation of EV fleets (both as a provider and a consumer of energy) offer major potentials for alleviating power system peak demands, minimizing power grid operation costs and hourly wind energy curtailments, and limiting the environmental impacts of fossil fuel-based thermal generating units in the stochastic operation of an electricity infrastructure.

A popular vehicle-to-grid control interface, which enables the aggregation of the charging mechanism for energy management in the distribution grid, is one of the most significant road blocks to realize this opportunity. Understanding the ecology of electric transportation and integrating it in local communities to alleviate the energy shortage at peak hours is very complicated. In this research paper, recent standardization initiatives aimed at overcoming obstacles such as the integration of electric cars into smart grids are discussed. A charge control scheme focused on vehicle-to-grid connectivity is implemented. It is observed that the rise of environmentally sustainable energy sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy, is straining the power network and their infrequent power generation is causing problems in power system operation, regulation and planning.

Despite the potential of EV loads offering emergency demand response (DR) for addressing such challenges, the willingness of EVs to respond to DR and the actual response quantity are uncertain. Furthermore, the uncertainty level in EV response varies along with DR incentive decisions, which further aggravates operation challenges. This paper proposes a resilient unit commitment (UC) model for EV-integrated power systems against extreme cold events. Specifically, first, we model how the temperature-sensitive EV charging loads change under extreme cold events considering the actual driving range and air conditioning load in EVs. Then, the inter-coupling relationship between uncertainties in EV response quantity and the DR incentive decisions is modeled. To overcome the limitations of conventional modeling approaches for decision-independent uncertainty, an affine function-based tractable model reformulation is presented addressing decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) in EV response. Subsequently, we establish the resilient UC model within a two-stage stochastic framework considering temperature-sensitive EV loads and DDU in EVs' response behaviors. Case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed UC model in cost-efficiently and reliably accommodating increased EV loads under extreme cold events.

As emerging technologies such as wind and solar generating systems become more cost effective, traditional power system operating strategies will need to be re-evaluated. The presence of wind and solar generation (commonly referred to as variable generation or VG) can increase variability and uncertainty in the net-load profile. One mechanism to mitigate this issue is to schedule and dispatch additional operating reserves. These operating reserves aim to ensure that there is enough capacity online in the system to account for the increased variability and uncertainty occurring at finer temporal resolutions. A new operating reserve strategy, referred to as flexibility reserve, has been introduced in some regions. A similar implementation is explored in this study, and its implications on power system operations are analysed. Results show that flexibility reserve products can improve economic metrics, particularly in significantly reducing the number of scarcity pricing events, with minimal impacts on reliability metrics and production costs. The production costs increased due to increased VG curtailment - i.e. including the flexible ramping product in the commitment of excess thermal capacity that needed to remain online at the expense of VG output.

However, the intermittent and unpredictable behaviour of renewable energy sources poses new challenges for the planning and operation of power systems. To overcome these issues, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges and improve power systems. This research focuses on improving the performance of the V2G system by implementing an intelligent fuzzy logic-based charge and discharge management system for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The system uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to ensure accurate and stable energy extraction from the photovoltaic system, even under varying irradiation conditions. Indeed, the fuzzy logic controller, in combination with the Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV)/CC (Constant Current) strategy, ensures the charging and discharging of the electric vehicle batteries according to specific pre-defined conditions. The system is connected to the grid using a three-phase inverter controlled by the voltage source control strategy. The efficiency of the proposed system is supported by detailed simulation results which demonstrate maximum power extraction without oscillation or overshoot, as well as remarkable stability and resistance to gradual or abrupt changes in irradiance and load variations. The fuzzy system facilitates intelligent management, allowing EVs to actively participate in energy balancing activities, ensuring load con-tinuity and enabling charging of other vehicles. The system achieves a constant energy efficiency of 97 % under different conditions.

During the planning or reinforcement stage of distribution networks, it is paramount to have some estimations and analyses done on system-wide EV charging loads that will be placed in the network. Thus, this paper systematically investigates the EV fleet composition, market shares, and charging patterns within New Zealand (NZ) area. A multivariate probabilistic modelling of dependent random variables and cumulative distribution functions is adopted for the accurate estimation of aggregated EV charging demands. Several vehicle travel survey data sets are utilised to quantitatively determine charging behaviours and driving patterns of EVs. The developed methodology based on Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) is utilised to generate results close to the real use-cases daily power demand, which can be further utilised in the analysis of EV charging strategies. In addition, non-smart and smart EV charging strategies are introduced to mitigate impacts of the large-scale EV deployment and to guarantee the charging completion for each EV.	[Su, Jun; Lie, T.

One possible way to use EVs in energy balancing is to let each distribution system mitigate its forecast uncertainties through the flexibility of EVs. In consideration of the difficulties to directly govern a large number of EVs, it is more reasonable for distribution systems to dispatch electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs). Without influencing driving activities of EVs in the next day, a model is established for distribution systems to make use of EVAs, whose contributions are delaying uncertainties through their temporal flexibility and thus creating opportunities for uncertainties from different hours to offset each other. In the established model, a scheme of uncertainty transferring is proposed to relieve interruption to EVAs and distributionally robust optimization is adopted to evaluate the operation plans' average performance with temporal and spatial uncertainty correlations considered. Comprehensive case studies are carried out based on charging demands of EVAs simulated from real traffic data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Optimal Load Sharing between Lithium-Ion Battery and Supercapacitor for Electric Vehicle Applications	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								There has been a suggestion for the best energy management method for an electric vehicle with a hybrid power system. The objective is to supply the electric vehicle with high-quality electricity. The hybrid power system comprises a supercapacitor (SC) bank and a lithium-ion battery. The recommended energy management plan attempts to maintain the bus voltage while providing the load demand with high-quality power under various circumstances. The management controller is built on a metaheuristic optimization technique that enhances the flatness theory-based controller's trajectory generation parameters. The SC units control the DC bus while the battery balances the power on the common line. This study demonstrates the expected contribution using particle swarm optimization and performance are assessed under various optimization parameters, including population size and maximum iterations. Their effects on controller performance are examined in the study. The outcomes demonstrate that the number of iterations significantly influences the algorithm's ability to determine the best controller parameters. The results imply that combining metaheuristic optimization techniques with flatness theory can enhance power quality. The suggested management algorithm ensures power is shared efficiently, protecting power sources and providing good power quality.

The study was carried out using a generation planning model combined with a unit commitment and economic dispatch model. The results from the planning model show a strong shift away from combined cycle gas turbines to open cycle gas turbines and gas engines as the share of wind power and solar photovoltaic increases. Demand side flexibility measures pushed this trend further. The results from the unit commitment and economic dispatch model demonstrate that the flexibility measures decrease the ramping frequency of thermal units, while the ramp rates of thermal units remain largely unchanged or increased. This indicates that the flexibility measures can cover smaller ramps in the net load more cost-effectively but that thermal power plants are still valuable for larger ramps. Impacts on emissions and electricity prices are also explored.

There is also significant increase in load that may come in the form of electric vehicles (EV) charging and hydrogen requirement for decarbonization of other sectors. While there is a growing literature around long-term decarbonization strategies, there is still ample room for a practical methodology to rigorously test capacity plans to include a range of options inter alia re- optimization of the mix of renewable technologies, better coordination of the (EV) load from a system perspective, or augmenting the plan with battery energy storage (BESS) and hydrogen. This paper presents our research on EV load and green hydrogen modeling including how they can be integrated into long-term electricity models. We also present a methodology that allows planners to undertake a rigorous assessment that can be readily implemented using the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM). The application of the model is illustrated through a case study for Turkey (Turkiye) for 2050. The case study shows how an incumbent policy-driven capacity plan for 2050 that included 33% contribution from variable renewable energy (VRE) may be prone to unserved energy risk during winter months due to seasonal variability of VRE. The analysis goes on to demonstrate how the plan can be reinforced with additional peaking gas turbines, re- optimization of wind and solar, BESS and hydrogen. Coordinated charging of EVs is also shown to bring significant relief to investment requirements.

J	Tabari, M; Yazdani, A				Tabari, Mansour; Yazdani, Amirnaser			An Energy Management Strategy for a DC Distribution System for Power System Integration of Plug-In Electric Vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				Article								This paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) for a dc distribution system for power system integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The dc distribution system is intended to integrate electric vehicles in a parking lot with an ac grid through bidirectional dc-dc converters (battery chargers) and a central voltage-sourced converter. Using an online constrained optimization algorithm, the proposed EMS manages the power flow within the dc system. Thus, the PEV owners can charge or discharge their batteries based on the state-of-charge of the batteries and their upcoming trip plans. The EMS offers two energy exchange options to the PEV owners: 1) the fast energy exchange option for the owners wishing to minimize the energy exchange time; and 2) the optimal energy exchange option for the owners intend to either minimize their costs of charging or maximize their revenues through selling their stored energy. The proposed EMS seamlessly handles all charging/discharging requests from the PEV owners with different options and, at the same time, it takes into account the power demand and power generation limits of the ac grid to preclude under-voltage, over-voltage, and reverse power flow issues. Various energy exchange scenarios are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS.

As a result, power companies need to reduce the operational cost and maximize profits by operating generators with high efficiency. On the other hand, the all electric residences are increasing, so controllable loads such as the electric water heater, heat pump and electric vehicle are being introduced to the power systems. The conventional system does not operate using thermal units with controllable loads in a coordinated manner. Therefore, the smart grid has become very popular in all over the world. This paper focuses on the reactive power scheduling of controllable loads, and determines the optimal operation of thermal units by satisfying the voltage constraints. The proposed method can satisfy the voltage constraint and reduce the rate of the power cost for a power system. The optimal control algorithm has been determined by the Tabu search method. Simulation results verify the proposed method and validate the performance and effectiveness of the control algorithm applied to the controllable loads and batteries.

J	Strezoski, L; Stefani, I				Strezoski, Luka; Stefani, Izabela			Enabling mass integration of electric vehicles through distributed energy resource management systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								Global initiatives are actively progressing to integrate large numbers of electric vehicles (EVs) as part of efforts to electrify and decarbonize the transportation sector. This approach plays a crucial role in addressing global greenhouse emissions and pollution problems. However, mass integration of EVs imposes unprecedented challenges to electrical power systems, especially to their distribution grids. These challenges range from planning issues, where the traditional panning procedures are not adequate for integration of EVs and their charging stations, to operational challenges, where a huge number of dispersed EVs can cause peak load increase, voltage violations, congestions, feeder overloads, etc. Hence, despite the significant importance of maximizing the deployment of EVs, their stochastic integration can give rise to critical challenges in electric power systems, thereby impeding their subsequent expansion. Therefore, in order to properly integrate mass amounts of EVs, without causing technical violations in the electrical power system, intelligent software tools are required, to aid distribution system operators and engineers in the transition to a new era of electrified transportation. In this paper, we argue that novel software solutions called Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMSs) are a key solution for enabling a safe integration of mass amounts of EVs into emerging distribution grids. Specifically, we introduce a novel Hybrid DERMS framework, as an integration of multiple hierarchical levels of DER management solutions, and propose this solution as a suitable instrument for distribution system operators and grid engineers to safely integrate and manage high volumes of EVs within the grid infrastructure. The hypothesis is validated through a real -life use case for integration and management of high amounts of EVs into an existing distribution grid, using an industrial DERMS solution. Specifically, an in-depth analysis of adding two large charging stations, boasting capacities of 5 MW each, has been performed through all stages of integration, from the planning stage, up to using their flexible output to manage technical constraint violations in real time. The influence of these EV charging stations on both the feeder where they are planned to be integrated, as well as on the entire supply substation, have been analyzed in detail. The resultant findings, especially on successfully managing overloads, peak load increases, as well as voltage violations through intelligent use of aggregated EVs through DERMS, have proven to be notably encouraging, further substantiating the paper's hypothesis.

Since peak power cannot be satisfied only by generator, hybrid energy storage system (HESS) should be well sized to match their energetic performances versus instantaneous power requirement and improve reliability of electrical power system. To deal with these challenges, a sizing optimization for HESS with considering energy management strategy (EMS) based on virtual-droop control in aircraft is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the spectrum characteristics of HPPL profile, splitting frequency between different types of energy storage devices is specially analyzed and designed to give full play to HESS. HESS weight, loss and parameters in EMS are taken into account in this multi-objective optimization based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms II (NSGA-II). Series of Pareto fronts can be obtained through the optimization process, and the most suitable solutions of different HESS combinations are selected by a decision-making means which combines subjective and objective weighting methods. Finally, optimization results of four different combinations are compared. Simulation results are obtained in MATLAB/Simulink environment to prove the rationality and applicability of the optimal sizing tool. The research has resulted in a solution of HESS and EMS optimization for HPPL used in aircraft.

Multi-objective optimal short-term planning of renewable distributed generations and capacitor banks in power system considering different uncertainties including plug-in electric vehicles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The increasing penetration of solar distributed generations (SDGs) and wind distributed generations (WDGs) together with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will lead to a promising amount of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, they bring about adversities such as uncertainty in production-load sides, augmented power loss, and voltage instability in the power system, which should be carefully addressed to increase the reliability. In this concern, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization methodology for sizing and siting of SDGs, WDGs, and capacitor banks (CBs) in the power system considering uncertainties stemmed from PEVs load demand, solar irradiance, wind speed, and the conventional load. The understudy objectives are the voltage stability index, green-house gas emissions, and the total cost. An unconventional point estimate method (PEM) is used to handle the related uncertainties, and chance-constrained programming method is deployed to deal with smooth constraints. The corresponding probability distribution functions of output variables are estimated by the maximum entropy method. Furthermore, robustness analysis is made by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed methodology is applied to a typical radial distribution network. The results show that the presence of PEV's significantly increases the load demand, which results in voltage collapse in the distribution system without the presence of distributed generations. However, the proposed probabilistic method ensures the safe operation of the distribution system with the optimal allocation of renewable distributed generations and CBs. Moreover, the results of deterministic and probabilistic cases are compared under different penetration levels of PEVs. The best tradeoff solution of the Pareto front is selected by the fuzzy satisfying method.	[Zeynali, Saeed; Rostami, Naghi; Feyzi, M.

As network planning is becoming a more complex task, an approach to automated network planning that yields the optimal reinforcement strategy is outlined. Different reinforcement measures are weighted against each other in terms of technical feasibility and costs by applying a genetic algorithm. Traditional reinforcements as well as novel solutions including voltage regulation are considered. To account for electric vehicle charging, a method to determine the uptake in equivalent load is presented. For this, measured data of households and statistical data of electric vehicles are combined in a stochastic analysis to determine the simultaneity factors of household load including electric vehicle charging.

This paper develops further the coordinated and frequency level-dependent distributed energy resources (DERs) control and adaptive on-load-tap-changers (OLTCs) management scheme which enables prioritized flexibility services provision for the DSOs and TSO. The key idea of the scheme is that the coordination of flexibility utilisation between DSOs and TSOs is done depending on the severity of the situation from the whole power system's viewpoint regarding frequency deviation level. During smaller frequency deviations DSOs' needs are prioritized and during larger frequency deviations priority is on TSO's needs to support momentarily the stability of the whole power system. The overall target of the studied management scheme is also to increase DERs', especially photovoltaics' (PVs') and electric vehicles' (EVs'), hosting capacity in the DSOs' networks and increase DERs availability for the flexibility services provision to the TSO during smaller frequency deviations. In this paper, enhanced OLTC control principles are presented including novel interconnection transformer OLTC control scheme for larger medium-voltage (MV) network-connected DER units. This MV DER OLTC control logic can enable, for example, same DER active power response with 7.7% smaller current or 8.5% higher DER unit active power response with the same current value. In addition, this paper studies the effect of different OLTC control inputs, DER reactive power control settings, LV feeder length and large-scale integration of EVs on low-voltage (LV) network with multiple PSCAD simulations. At the end, further improvement possibilities of the studied management scheme are also briefly described.

Time-Series Modeling of Aggregated Electric Vehicle Charging Station Load	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS				Article								The widespread proliferation of Electric Vehicles (EVs) can have a transformative effect on the electric power system. The power and energy consumed by EVs when charging is substantial, which has consequences on power system operation and planning. This paper identifies, evaluates, and proposes time-series seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models of aggregated EV charging station load. The modeling is based on 2 years of time-stamped aggregate power consumption from over 2400 charging stations in Washington State and San Diego, California. The different data sets allow the influence of time-of-use pricing on the time-series models to be explored. Weekday, weekend, and near-term and long-term models are developed and analyzed. The best performing near-term weekday models are (2, 0, 0) x (0, 1, 1)(24) x (1, 0, 0)(120) for Washington State and (2, 0, 0) x (1, 1, 0)(24) x (0, 0, 1)(48) for San Diego. Applications of the seasonal ARIMA models to aggregate EV charging station load forecasting and creation of synthetic time-series at different penetration levels are discussed.

Whereas, its features of time mismatch with power demand and uncertainty pose barriers for the power system to utilize it effectively. Hence, a novel unit commitment model is proposed in this paper considering demand response and electric vehicles, which can promote the exploitation of wind power. On the one hand, demand response and electric vehicles have the feasibility to change the load demand curve to solve the mismatch problem. On the other hand, they can serve as reserve for wind power.

This problem is a bi-level optimisation problem. In the upper-level problem, the objective function is to maximise the profit for each resource, that is, the generation company (GENCO), wind generation company (WINDCO), and transmission company (TRANSCO) as well as the DRP aggregator. Also, the lower-level problem considers a market model with the participation of private GENCOs, WINDCOs, TRANSCOs, and DRP aggregators. The lower-level problem minimises energy cost subject to AC power flow (PF) equations, power network limitations, pollution constraint, GENCO, WINDCO, TRANSCO constraints, and technical limitations of DRPs. Here, the lower-level problem is non-linear and non-convex. Accordingly, to facilitate the solution of the proposed bi-level optimisation problem, a linear model is proposed. Then, the proposed bilevel optimisation problem is converted into an integrated single-level one using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Eventually, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 6-bus and the IEEE 30-bus test systems, and finally, the capabilities of the proposed scheme are evaluated.

However, the lack of pervasive en-route charging infrastructure on regional highway networks hinders the use of electric vehicles for long-distance intercity trips. Traditionally, transportation and power systems are often studied separately, each by itself as a complex system. This paper proposes a system of systems modeling framework for planning charging infrastructure deployment in intercity transportation networks while considering users' travel behavior and coupling relationships between transportation and power systems. The aim is at facilitating long-distance electric vehicle travels and providing an effective and comprehensive tool to evaluate the total emissions from both the transportation and power sectors. We look at a somewhat "forward-looking" problem in which the charging loads of widely-adopted electric vehicles induce interdependence between the power and the transportation sectors. A general equilibrium modeling framework is developed to capture the interdependencies among charging infrastructure design, users' travel behaviors, and power sector operations. An iterative solution approach is proposed to solve the overall equilibrium between the transportation and power sectors, and a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the bi-level subproblem for the charging infrastructure deployment. Numerical experiments based on a semi-realistic case study are performed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed modeling and solution approach.

However, smart management of PEVs in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system can result in benefits to the grid such as load leveling, and cost reduction. This paper proposes a unit commitment model for a V2G system connected to a smart power grid. The model considers different penetration levels of PEVs and investigates the economic and technical effects of using PEVs to support the grid. The proposed methodology incorporates controlled charging and discharging as well as accounting for battery degradation in the unit commitment problem. The model is tested using an IEEE 24 bus network to determine the impact of high PEV penetration on generation cost. A comparison between a system without V2G and a system with V2G is presented to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach. The results show that the optimal scheduling of PEVs leads to reduction in generation cost and is effective in leveling the load profile through valley filling and peak load reduction.

The effectiveness of the proposed technique is tested on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system with considering the power system constraints and using genetic algorithm. This algorithm selects the optimal sites and sizes (number of electric vehicles) of these parking lots and shows the optimal results. The results of these simulations with genetic algorithm demonstrate that the economic problem of parking lots placement depends on many items such as number of the electrical vehicles (EVs) in each parking lot (capacity of parking lot), state of charge of EVs, as well as the electricity price in peak/off-peak periods. Moreover, it is suggested that the existence of parking lots, considering adequate incentives for EVs owners, has economic benefit for distribution network operators, reduces total power loss, and can improve the distribution,system voltage profile. Also, the number of parking lots to be allocated in a distribution system supports the distribution system at peak load hours because it is more interesting from economic point of view to install more parking lots.

This article proposes a novel gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm-based transmission expansion planning (TEP) method considering renewable energy sources and EVs and evaluates the performance of alternating current power flow (ACPF) and direct current power flow (DCPF) models in the TEP problem in terms of accuracy, run-time, and objective functions. The uncertainty associated with renewable energy sources, EVs, and loads are explicitly modeled in this study using probability density functions (pdfs) and the Copula approach. The proposed GWO-based TEP method is validated by case studies using the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system (RTS) and IEEE 118-bus test system.

Driven by an urgent desire to mitigate the effects of global warming and a foreseen end to the world's fossil fuel resources, an increasing tendency toward renewable energies is fostered by the international community. On the other hand, distributed generation and electric vehicle adoption are altering load nature and profile. Therefore, energy storage (ES) becomes a necessity for its ability to bridge the gap between the dynamically changing supply and demand in addition to other ancillary services it can provide. Meanwhile, advances in smart grid technologies enable escalating the incorporation of new technologies with more efficient control schemes and energy management algorithms. This paper presents an overview on the employment of ES technologies in planning and operation of distribution systems through the literature survey. The problem of sizing and siting ES units in distribution systems is first introduced. The state of the art of the technology is summarized, and some outstanding issues to be addressed through future research are highlighted.

Herein, the uncertain EVPLs are integrated into the SCUC problem with the aim of reducing the operation cost. It is notable that growing integration of unspecified EVPLs can introduce novel challenges to the power system, significantly impacting its flexibility. In this study, electric vehicles are leveraged as a means to enhance system flexibility. Meanwhile, the FDI attacks in EVPLs can distort the system's flexibility and lead to inaccurate assessments of the power system's ability to adapt to changing conditions. In order to model the FDI attack, a bi-level optimization problem based on mixed integer linear programming is formulated. At the upper level, the impact of EVPLs on the flexibility indices of the SCUC is evaluated, and the false data injected into the EVPL is calculated at the lower level. Since both levels of the proposed FBSCUCP-P/EV FDI include discrete variables, a reformulation and decomposition technique is utilized to achieve the optimal solution. Instead, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based machine learning method is considered to detection and correction of FDI attack. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 24-bus system. The simulation results initially indicate the improvement of the flexibility of the power system in proposed structure. Further, injecting false data into all available EVPLs causes to increase the system operation cost. Besides, false data leads to distorted charging and discharging scheduling of EVPLs; likewise, scheduling and commitment of power generation units also changes. Subsequently, the application of the XGBoost algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of FDI attacks, achieving a maximum accuracy of 85.41%.

In this situation, the charging cost of an EV can be reduced by considering other EVs' charging strategies and avoiding simultaneous charging. In this article, we develop a distributed EV charging mechanism (D-EVCM) where each EV possesses some information, such as the charging probabilities of other EVs, electricity price, current energy level, and expected departure time. Based on the information, an EV periodically decides whether to charge its battery in a distributed manner. To minimize the average charging cost of EV while avoiding the situation where an EV departs from a charging station with insufficient energy level, a constrained stochastic game model is formulated and its solution is obtained using a best response dynamics-based algorithm. The evaluation results show that D-EVCM can reduce the average charging cost over 48% with a sufficient low battery outage probability (e.g., 0.01%) compared to a threshold-based charging scheme.

The optimal sizing of this assembly, especially with the minimization of mass, is one of the challenges of designing the power system of an electric vehicle. The condition of the unpredictability of the power demand determined by the vehicle driver must also be added, which must be met by the power system without exceeding safe operating limits for the devices. This article presents a methodology for minimizing the mass of the electrical energy storage system (ESS) that considers the various aspects mentioned and a variety of battery technologies and supercapacitor values. The resulting minimum mass dimensioning is verified by simulation for different driving cycles under conditions of maximum power demand. The system also includes a tertiary source, such as a fuel cell, responsible for the vehicle's extended autonomy. In addition to sizing the ESS, the article also proposes a management strategy for the various sources to guarantee the vehicle's expected performance while respecting each device's operational limits.

However, these new concerns may have an adverse effect on the complexity of the operation of the network, they present great opportunities to the network operators for a better service, in terms of lower costs and enhanced security. In this paper, the integration of the coordinated aggregated Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) fleets and Demand Response Programs (DRPs) into power systems is studied using the stochastic reliability-based Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC). The proposed SCUC program minimizes network operation costs while determining the best strategy for deployment of PEVs and DRPs. Moreover, the proposed approach analyze the effect of these resources on the adequacy of the power system by considering reliability metrics Being a mobile power storing device enables the PEVs to provide their energy to the network when called upon. Moreover, DRPs can mitigate power consumption during the peak load or in case of a contingency. Optimal integration of these resources could reduce the network operating costs and improve security. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model is employed for power system modeling in a smart grid environment. In the proposed model, PEV fleets are modeled as virtual power plants that can provide electric power while DRPs are assumed to only affect the power consumption of the customers. The proposed paradigm is applied to the IEEE 6-bus and IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) to illustrate its effectiveness. Numerical analyses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in lessening the cost of network operations, better performance in case of contingencies and a higher level of reliability.

This work is the first study that includes the actual weather data and transportation data with realistic and coordinated distribution and transmission grid data in a large industry-scale level study. The main goal of this study is to identify possible issues and required upgrades in the electric grid, caused by an increase in EV integration. The transmission case study is a large grid with 6717 buses over a Texas footprint, and the distribution grid is over Houston, a city in Texas, covering over three million customers. The resulting overloads and voltage violations experienced in the system are discussed, and required planning upgrades to avoid these issues are suggested.

Incorporating emerging flexible resources like electric vehicle parking lots (EVPLs) and demand response programs (DRPs) into power systems, could be a good solution to deal with inherent uncertainties imposed by these resources to the power grid. EVPLs can improve power system operating conditions by active and reactive power injection capabilities. The participation of consumers in DRPs can also improve energy consumption management by decreasing or shifting loads to other periods. This paper proposes a hybrid information gap decision theory (IGDT)stochastic method to solve a transmission constrained AC unit commitment model integrated with electric vehicle (EV), incentive-based DRP, and wind energy. The behavioural uncertainty related to EV owners is modelled using a scenario-based method. Additionally, an IGDT method is applied to manage wind energy uncertainty under a two-level optimization model. Verification of the proposed model is done under several case studies. Based on the results achieved, the proposed risk-based hybrid model allows the operator to differentiate between the risk level of existing uncertainties and apply a high-flexibility decision-making model to deal with such difficulties. Additionally, the role of the aforementioned flexible resources in the reduction of power system running costs and wind power uncertainty handling are evaluated. Numerical results confirm a 3.7% reduction in the daily operating costs as a consequence of coordinated scheduling of EVPL and DRP. Moreover, Taking advantage of reactive power injection of EVPL provides more cost savings.

Coordinated distributed energy resources and PEV charging can mitigate the impact of this shift. This study presents an analysis of photovoltaic (PV) solar parking lots that address this benefit. Real-world charging data, solar data, and electricity tariffs are used to determine the microgrid system that minimises the cost of retrofitting an existing parking lot with PV and PEV infrastructure coupled. The result is a load scheduling algorithm that takes into account tariffs and insolation to reduce costs while ensuring customer satisfaction. The techno-economic feasibility of PV infrastructure in the microgrid is determined by minimising the net present cost (NPC) in two case studies: Victoria, BC, and Los Angeles, CA. Relatively low solar irradiation and electricity prices make it economically infeasible to install solar panels in Victoria even though the operational costs are reduced by 11%. In Los Angeles, high time-of-use prices, together with abundant solar radiation, make PV retrofitting economically feasible with any array capacity. At the current solar infrastructure price, coordinated charging in this region yields 8-16% savings on NPC and smaller feeder size requirements with greater load growth opportunities.

J	Kurukuru, VSB; Khan, MA; Singh, R				Kurukuru, Varaha Satya Bharath; Khan, Mohammed Ali; Singh, Rupam			Electric Vehicle Charging/Discharging Models for Estimation of Load Profile in Grid Environments	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS				Article								The increasing electric vehicles (EVs) and their integration with the electrical networks to achieve the charging demands has highly affected the operation of the power system. These effects are due to the increased and variable amount of electricity consumption caused by the irregular charging patterns of EVs. As the EV penetration level increases with such irregular charging patterns, the overall load profile in a network will increase resulting in load peaks. To overcome this, a well-planned charging-discharging algorithm is needed for the EV users and the power suppliers. In light of the above issues and requirements, this paper proposes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation-based EV charging (EVC) behavior models and charging-discharging power prediction models. The proposed methods analyze the traveling behavior of EVs, and their charging patterns to make EV a flexible load. This helps in understanding the variable electricity consumption and mitigating the peak loads and load variations. Further, to assess the operation of the proposed methods, the charging-discharging power prediction is carried out for a large EV fleet based on the historical data. The power predictions are carried out for 100 days and the convergence of the proposed algorithm is targeted to be kept below 0.5% to achieve optimal power prediction. The results showed the credibility of the proposed approach in identifying the daily average charging-discharging load curves.

This research provides a comprehensive mathematical optimization model for EV charging scheduling that integrates stochastic network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) with N-1 criteria and network losses. A generalized generation distribution factor (GGDF) for the pre-and post-contingency selection technique is applied based on the DC power flow model to address the uncertain parameters. A line outage distribution factors (LODF) method is proposed for the post-contingency constraints to reduce the computational burden due to many scenarios and N-k line outages. In addition, the bender decomposition approach is employed to simplify the problem complexity. Hence, this work evaluates the impact of transportation networks for EV charging stations and N-k outages in a proposed model for economic and technical benefits. The validity of the NCUC model is substantiated through verification using IEEE 24-bus systems. The economic benefits shared by EV charging stations and RES with post-contingency LODF were reduced by about 5.91% in scheduling costs as compared to the conventional preventive GGDF-based approach.

The challenge, however, is to ensure an efficient incorporation of large scale of HVACs into unit commitment to enhance the intra-hour flexibility for system operation. To this end, this paper focuses on the aggregation and scheduling of multi-chiller HVAC systems in continuous-time stochastic unit commitment. The continuous-time modeling method is utilized to handle the sub-hourly variability of wind power and the intra-hour flexibility of the HVAC systems. To describe the electricity consumption characteristic of the HVAC system with multiple chillers, a cooling model is formulated based on the chiller load sharing strategy and linearization method. Besides, an aggregation method for heterogeneous HVACs to provide reserve capacity is proposed to improve computational efficiency. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 118-test systems validate the effectiveness of the modeling and aggregation for multi-chiller HVAC systems, and demonstrate the benefits of applying the continuous-time HVAC reserve provision model to enhance the flexibility for the power system operation.

Furthermore, electrification of the transportation system is an alternative promoted by many governments to mitigate the dependency on fossil fuels and achieve the goals of decarbonizing the economy. However, interconnecting a large quantity of distributed energy resources (DERs) to the power system reveals technical problems affecting the entire system. Planning coordinators and grid operators need to understand the full-spectrum impact of DERs on the power system to ensure secure and reliable grid planning and operations. The operation of a Hydro-Que<acute accent>bec transmission system planned for 2030 is simulated in quasi-static time series mode with a massive integration of 1 million of electric vehicles and 1000 - 3000 MW of distributed photovoltaics.

J	Ye, R; Huang, XL; Chen, Z; Ji, ZY; Tan, LL				Ye, Rui; Huang, Xueliang; Chen, Zhong; Ji, Zhenya; Tan, Linlin			Novel fast forecasting method for nodal voltage violations	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				Article								With the increase penetration of new energy and electric vehicles (EVs), the nodal voltage violations (NVVs) problem is widely concerned. Voltage predictive regulation methods can prevent NVVs and improve the performance of traditional voltage control. A fast and reliable forecasting method for NVVs is a key requirement to support this application. However, it is time-consuming to forecast NVVs using a Monte Carlo simulation-based probabilistic load flow method and the traditional deterministic method based on load forecasting has low reliability due to it not considering the uncertainty of load forecasting errors. A novel fast forecasting method for NVVs with shorter computational time and higher reliability is proposed. In the proposed method, the uncertainty of the load forecasting is taken into account and the impact of active/reactive power change on NVVs can be quantified like the traditional deterministic method. Thus, this method can assist in correcting voltage regulation plans so that voltage constraints can be satisfied as much as possible. Finally, the IEEE 69-bus test system and real historical load series are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Electricity trading among the three and hydrogen trading between IP and P2H is considered in the model to maximize their own interests. Specifically, IP focus on distributed PV integration and low carbon travels, P2H strives to improve cost competitiveness of hydrogen, and electricity-hydrogen trading prices and quantities are optimized between them. Also, GC obtains profits by charging grid fees considering power flow constraints. The cooperation game model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming problem through linearization methods. Case studies show that electricity-hydrogen trading among the three has apparent advantages over pure electricity coupling or non-cooperation. With future reduction of investment prices of PV and P2H and maturity of the carbon trading market, the profit margin of this cooperation model can be further enhanced.

This model not only takes into account the influence of new CFs on the power system but also considers the impact of CF locations on traffic flow distribution and congestion level in the transportation system (TS). Yen's algorithm is innovatively employed to offer multiple possible choices for EV drivers' route selection considering CF locations determined in the traffic flow assignment model. Overall, the total cost of both distribution and TSs is minimized to obtain the optimal CF planning results. For the DS, generation cost, energy loss, and penalty cost for voltage deviation are included. For the TS, the main objective is to ensure EVs can reach their destinations at the lowest cost, while the travel time due to different path selections and the delay time caused by congestion can be minimized. Finally, a comprehensive case study on the integrated IEEE 30-bus and a 25-node TS is conducted to validate our approach.

This trend results in the decline of system inertia and thus raises the frequency secure issue. Concurrently, electric vehicles (EVs) proliferate. Numerous EVs hold a huge potential of frequency regulation in case of contingency as EVs are able to achieve primary frequency responses (PFRs) via vehicle to grid chargers. However, the value of frequency responses from aggregated EVs has not fully exploited. This paper, proposes a chance constrained scheduling model incorporating the ability of PFRs from aggregated EVs. The proposed model characterizes uncertainties associated PFR capacities from aggregated EVs and wind power forecast errors by the Wasserstein-metric ambiguity sets, which do not rely on distributional assumption, and then formulates uncertainties-related constraints as distributionally robust (DR) chance constraints. These DR chance constraints are reformulated as tractable linear programs. Consequently, the proposed model leads to a mixed-integer linear program. Numerical results on a modified IEEE 39-bus system show that incorporating PFR from EVs can reduce total costs from $4,540,396 to $4,431,233, which is reduced by 2.4%. The proposed model also achieves better reliability compared to traditional methods, demonstrating the distributionally robust optimization in enhancing electricity scheduling and rising renewable integration.

The uncertainty of renewable energy output is represented by empirical prediction intervals in the traditional interval optimization scheduling model, but the interval range is not precise enough. To address this problem, a novel improved interval optimization method is proposed in this paper. First, the improved adaptive diffusion kernel density estimation (IADKDE) is used to obtain more accurate intervals for the renewable energy output. Furthermore, a data-driven adaptive optimal bandwidth selection is adopted to select the optimal bandwidth instead of normal reference rules in IADKDE. In addition, the day-ahead scheduling optimization model is developed by IADKDE considering the driving requirements of electric vehicles (EVs) owners. The proposed model is described in details and solved by interval linear programming method. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are validated, and the comparative analysis with interval optimization by empirical prediction intervals, extreme learning machine(ELM) and stochastic optimization is given. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can obtain more accurate interval ranges of uncertain variables and has strong applicability.

The successful deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) in the transportation sector depends on fast charging station, charging process, autonomy, and EVs on-road price. This paper focuses on the installation of a fast charging station, a case study of IEEE 24-bus test system. The paper presents siting of charging stations with different power ratings of 5, 25, 50, and 100 MW onto the load bus lines in a different test case system keeping in mind the violation of voltage magnitude limit (0.95 < V < 1.05) and line ratings. Four different test cases have been analyzed using Newton-Raphson (NR) method for the integration of charging stations.The random charging of EVs results in power fluctuations at the grid side, power quality issues, and equipment loss of life. Distributed generators (DGs) are an effective way to improve the quality of energy services. Proper siting and sizing of DGs are done, taking into account four different test cases with pre-installed charging stations to overcome the network's losses and maintain the system's stability.

J	Guerrero, JDA; Acker, TL; Castro, R				Guerrero, Jose David Alvarez; Acker, Thomas L.; Castro, Rafael			Power System Impacts of Electric Vehicle Charging Strategies	ELECTRICITY				Article								This article explores the potential impacts of integrating electric vehicles (EVs) and variable renewable energy (VRE) on power system operation. EVs and VRE are integrated in a production cost model with a 5 min time resolution and multiple planning horizons to deduce the effects of variable generation and EV charging on system operating costs, EV charging costs, dispatch stacks, reserves and VRE curtailment. EV penetration scenarios of the light-duty vehicle fleet of 10%, 20%, and 30% are considered in the RTS-GMLC test system, and VRE penetration is 34% of annual energy consumption. The impacts of EVs are investigated during the annual peak in the summer and during the four weeks of the year in which high VRE and low loads lead to overgeneration. Uncoordinated and coordinated EV charging scenarios are considered. In the uncoordinated scenario, charging is undertaken at the convenience of the EV owners, modeled using data from the Idaho National Laboratory's EV Project. Coordinated charging uses an "aggregator" model, wherein EV charging is scheduled to minimize operating costs while meeting the daily charging requirements subject to EV availability and charging constraints. The results show that at each EV penetration level, the uncoordinated charging costs were higher than the coordinated charging costs. During a high-VRE, low-load week, with uncoordinated EV charging at 30% penetration (3% energy penetration), the peak load increased by as much as 27%. Using coordinated charging, the EV load shifts to hours with low prices, coincident with either low load, high VRE, or both. Furthermore, coordinated charging substantially reduces the curtailment of PV by as much as nine times during the low-load seasons, and the curtailment of wind generation by more than half during the summer peak season, compared to the scenarios with no EVs and uncoordinated EV charging. Using a production cost model with multiple planning cycles, load and VRE forecasts, and a "look ahead" period during scheduling and dispatching units was crucial in creating and utilizing the flexibility of coordinated EV charging.

There is vast amount of literature on flexibility covering research, demonstration and validation activities. Nevertheless, there is still no unifying definition of the term "flexibility" and consistent characterizing terms for "flexibility resources". The lack of clarity in definitions and concepts may undermine information exchange amongst stakeholders imposing hurdles on the transition from mature technology to in-vestment decisions and deployment. System operators, for example, require better clarity for the techno-economic evaluation of flexibility resources in their planning processes. This paper, by reviewing prominent flexibility-related publications, proposes a comprehensive flexibility definition and unified characterizing terms for flexibility resources. Furthermore, the paper proposes a taxonomy method which is applied to classify flexibility resources. The presented taxonomy method clears the confusion on "what-is-what" under the concept of flexibility. This paper also presents the benefits of unified characterizing terms in mapping flexibility resources to ancillary services. The benefits are illustrated by considering a realistic use case in a Norwegian distribution network.

It needs to be supported by an effective EV charging and discharging behavior control strategy to meet the operation demand of the power system. An optimization model with the objectives of minimizing grid load variance and minimizing user charging cost is established. An improved hybrid algorithm is proposed for the optimal allocation of charging and discharging power of EVs by combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The performance of variant algorithm is tested using CEC2005 benchmarking functions sets and applied to the solution of the ordered charge-discharge optimal scheduling model. The results show that the convergence accuracy of the algorithm is better than the traditional algorithm, and it can effectively balance exploration and exploitation ability of the particles. In addition, the scheduling analysis is performed for different charging strategies of EVs. The scheduling results show that with the same optimization weights, implementing the ordered charging and discharging strategy can significantly reduce the charging cost of users and the load variance of the grid. Thus, the operational stability of the grid and the economic benefits for users are improved.

J	Ebrahimi, A; Moradlou, M; Bigdeli, M				Ebrahimi, Ahad; Moradlou, Majid; Bigdeli, Mehdi			Optimal siting and sizing of custom power system and smart parking lot in the active distribution network	IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION				Article								Non-linear loads, electrical vehicles (EVs) and power electronics are the sources of harmonic generation in the power system. Harmonics are the reason for the disturbance in the technical constraints and quality of the power system. These disadvantages are formed in the current and the voltage of the system branches and buses. To reduce these harmonics, active and passive power filters are used. Since active power filters (APFs) include electronic power switching devices, they are used to eliminate or reduce current or voltage harmonics. To properly reduce these harmonics and supply consumer demand, private investors (PIs) are considered to enhance the power quality, by investing in the APF units and the distribution network operator (DNO) coordinating and feeding the EVs, by equipping the network with smart parking lots. Total harmonic distortion, bus voltage profile, active power loss and energy not supplied (ENS) are considered problem attributes. Using techniques for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS), it is determined how the addition of photovoltaic (PV), energy storage system, and batteries affects the ranking of attributes from the perspectives of both DNO and PI. The best solutions are obtained in the first stage using a genetic algorithm (GA), and the attributes have been prioritized from a utility perspective in the second stage by TOPSIS. To verify the performance of GA and TOPSIS, all of the obtained results are compared with the other algorithms. As seen clearly, active, reactive power loss and ENS in scenarios with the participation PV are reduced. Furthermore, comparing the results of different algorithms confirms the efficiency of GA and TOPSIS. Here, a private investor, to enhance power quality, invests in active power filter units. Furthermore, the distribution network operator to coordinate and feed electric vehicles (EVs) decides to equip the network with smart parking lots. Total harmonic distortion, bus voltage profile, active power loss and energy not supplied are considered problem attributes.image	[Ebrahimi, Ahad; Moradlou, Majid; Bigdeli, Mehdi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Zanjan Branch, Zanjan, Iran		Bigdeli, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Zanjan Branch, Zanjan, Iran.	m.bigdeli@srbiau.ac.ir								5	7											APR	2024	18	5					779	795		10.1049/rpg2.12945	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/rpg2.12945		JAN 2024										2025-12-09

Accordingly, there have been various research topics on architectures of hybrid power systems to further improve the system performance ability and sizing optimization for the packaging and production cost reduction. In this study, a novel multimode power split hybrid architecture has been suggested, which is based on multiple driving modes such as input- and output-power split and parallel hybrid modes in order to achieve fuel efficiency improvement and sizing optimization. The performance ability and sizing aspects of the invented system have been analyzed in comparison with Toyota Hybrid System (THS), which is a kind of typical power split hybrid architecture. The fuel efficiency of the suggested system has been compared by a backward-facing simulation with Dynamic Programming (DP) for representative driving test cycles from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In terms of the component sizing, the maximum torque and speed variation trends of motors have been analyzed according to the velocity variation. In the simulation and analysis results, the invented system shows opportunities to improve fuel efficiency with multiple driving modes and to reduce component sizing of power electronics which is related to the production cost reduction as well as the vehicle packaging space minimization.

However, designing an effective and efficient online V2V charging strategy with optimal energy utilization remains an open issue. In this chapter, a price control based semi-distributed online V2V charging strategy is put forward for an energy swapping station. Specifically, through electricity price control, GEVs are stimulated to participate in V2V energy transactions by offering high revenues for the discharging GEVs and low cost for the charging GEVs. The Oligopoly game theory and Lagrange duality optimization techniques are leveraged to solve the formulated optimal V2V charging problems. Simulation are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed V2V charging strategy.

Conventional power flow (PF) approaches such as forward-backward sweep (FBS) and Newton-Raphson require a high number of iterations to solve non-linear PF equations making them computationally very intensive. PF is the most important study performed by utility, required in all stages of the power system, especially in operations and planning. This paper discusses the applications of deep learning (DL) to predict PF solutions for three-phase unbalanced power distribution grids. Three deep neural networks (DNNs); Radial Basis Function Network (RBFnet), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are proposed in this paper to predict PF solutions. The strength of the proposed DNN models over the traditional iterative-based PF solvers is that these models can capture the nonlinear relationships in PF calculations to accurately predict the solutions. The PF problem is formulated as a multi-output regression model where two or more output values are predicted based on the inputs. The training and testing data are generated through the OpenDSS-MATLAB COM interface. These methods are completely data-driven where the training relies on reducing the mismatch at each node without the need for the knowledge of the system. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that the models can accurately predict the PF solutions for the unbalanced distribution grids with mutual coupling and are robust to different R/X ratios, topology changes as well as generation and load variability introduced by the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs). To test the efficacy of the DNN models, they are applied to IEEE 4-node and 123-node test cases, and the American Electric Power (AEP) feeder model. The PF results for RBFnet, MLP, and CNN models are discussed in this paper which demonstrate that all three DNN models provide highly accurate results in predicting PF solutions.

EBs, driven by decarbonized electricity, can reduce the air pollution and noise level. Besides, they can also recover electricity from regenerative braking. Recent years have witnessed continuous works on the topics of EB energy storage, power management, and charging scheduling. In this review, we have comprehensively surveyed three primary parts: important components; existing research topics; and open issues of EBs. Specifically, we first introduce the important components of EBs, including energy storage systems, powertrains, interleaving elements and electric motors, and driving cycles. Then, we review the existing research topics of EBs, including the energy storage system sizing, power/energy management, range remedy methods, charging design/scheduling, and trial projects. At last, extending from existing literatures, we further propose the future research opportunities and ongoing challenges, such as extending EV related research to EBs, EB charging demand modeling, and EB impact on power systems.

Generation scheduling (GS) in IMGs is affected by the stochastic behavior of electric and heat loads due to outages of production processes or production lines and the uncertainties in solar irradiance and combined heat and power systems. This paper presents a stochastic scenario-based GS framework to consider uncertainties in an IMG coordinated with PEV charging. Although the scenario-based methods are usually very time consuming, this paper shows that their applications in IMGs will not significantly increase the calculation time. The proposed formulation guaranties that occurrence of each condition of uncertainty will not affect the PEV activities. An IMG with 12 factories, photovoltaic generations, and 6 types of electric vehicles with different battery sizes is considered and simulated. The main contributions are (1) a new stochastic GS problem formulation to minimize the cost of IMGs while fully charging all PEVs within their requested periods considering the network security, factories, and PEV constraints; (2) changing the nonlinear constraints to linear forms suitable for scenario-based optimization; and (3) considering the stochastic behavior of electric loads without requiring any data about their internal process in each factory.

An emphasis is on evaluation of electric vehicle scheduling and demand side management. The main benefit of this new simultaneous optimization approach is that it converges towards a global optimum by considering not only infrastructure investments but also energy cost changes due to scheduling measures as for example curtailment or demand side management. The article firstly analyzes degrees of freedom in grid planning and in scheduling to derive models. The sections thereafter present the algorithm for simultaneous optimization. It integrates a fast scheduling optimization into a meta-heuristic grid-planning algorithm. The grid-planning algorithm uses Delaunay triangulation and an ant colony systems approach. The scheduling optimization combines dynamic programming and a fast heuristic to consider grid constraints. The last section presents exemplary results and illustrates effects of different regulatory regimes on costs. Results suggest that market-based scheduling will prevail due to energy cost-savings. However, purely market-based scheduling is unattractive when grid costs are considered. Distribution system operators can reduce long-term grid costs significantly, if they may perform demand side management.

Valuation of measurement data for low voltage network expansion planning	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								The introduction of electric vehicles and photovoltaics is changing the residential electricity consumption. Distribution network operators (DNO) are investing in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to enable cost reduction through smart grid applications. The DNO also benefits from the additional measurement data the AMI gives for the network planning process. The availability of AMI data can be limited by the cost of communication and by privacy concerns. To determine the social welfare of an AMI, the economic gains should be estimated. For the planning of the low voltage (LV) network, a method for determining the value of an AMI still needs to be developed. Therefore, a planning methodology which allows various levels of measurement data availability has been developed. By applying this approach the value of different levels of AMI from an LV-network planning perspective can be determined. To illustrated the application of this approach a case study for the LV-network of a Dutch DNO is performed. The results show that an increase in measurement data can lead to (sic)49-254 lower LV-network reinforcement costs. A detailed analysis of the results shows that already 50% of the possible cost reduction can be achieved if only 65% of the households have AMI data available. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

This paper proposes a novel model to optimize day-ahead spinning reserve requirement (SRR) considering PEVs' contribution in providing operating reserve. Based on the probabilistic criteria, the cost of expected energy supplied by PEV (EESEV) is formulated. The costs of reserves from thermal generators and PEVs as well as expected energy not supplied (EENS) are considered together to determine optimal SRR. The post-contingency PEV reaction time is taken into account in the formation of EENS and EESEV. The capacities of PEV interruptible charging demand and vehicle to grid service are calculated, respectively, under the conditions of both immediate charging and smart charging strategies. The effects of PEVs on system SRR quantification, unit commitment are comprehensively analyzed using IEEE reliability test system. Numerical results systematically demonstrate the effectiveness of PEVs' participation on the reduction of operation costs and the improvement of power system reliability. Sensitivity analysis of PEV penetration level and compensation cost to PEV owners is compressively conducted to provide meaningful reference for future implementation.

A modified backward and forward sweep method for microgrid load flow analysis under different electric vehicle load mathematical models	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								A power flow analysis under different electric vehicle (EV) load models based on the modified backward and forward sweep method is presented. Voltage-dependent loads (VDLs) were used to analyze the total power loss and load voltage deviation (LVD) under different EV load models and the general load of the electrical power system. The VDL was defined in the backward stage where the voltage ratio was between bus voltages per nominal voltage. The IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system was selected to be the test system. The EV penetration level was defined as 26.88% compared to the base case of constant power (P). The simulation results showed the impact levels from EV load models to the grid based on the traditional method, with impact levels from high to low being for polynomial load (EVI), constant current load (EVIII), and VDL (EVII) models, respectively. In particular, the highest impact for EVI was in scenario 4 (D), where the total active power loss, total reactive power loss, and LVD were 3.45%, 3.47%, and 3.36%, respectively. Therefore, the EV load model was one important factor to select for solving the power flow of the grid. Moreover, the position and size of the EV load could be considered in the optimal condition for reducing the impact to the grid. However, energy management will become a key challenge for supporting the high penetration of EVs in the near future.

Nonlinear constraint optimization to reduce the running cost, losses, and voltage variations is focused for the optimization. Loss sensitivity analysis is used to find the location wind, solar, distributed generators, distributed energy storage devices, and DSTATCOM. Firefly algorithm is used to optimize the size of distributed generators and DSTATCOM. Optimization reduced the loss, power taken from the grid and improves the voltages in the system.

J	Saber, AY; Kabir, KM; Khandelwal, T				Saber, Ahmed Yousuf; Kabir, Kazi Meharajul; Khandelwal, Tanuj			Optimum Resource Sizing and Operation in Virtual Power Plant Framework: VPP optimization and operation	IEEE ELECTRIFICATION MAGAZINE				Article								The optimum size and operation of virtual power plants (VPPs) are essential for sustainable green power systems in modern society. Renewable energy (mainly wind and solar) is intermittent and non-dispatchable. The aggregator of available energy storage systems and controllable loads, including heating, cooling, EV charging/discharging, etc., can mitigate those issues in the VPP framework and maintain system balance. The VVP platform's wind speed, solar radiation, and load demand are highly dynamic. Without intelligent coordination, it is impossible to determine the optimal size of the resources with minimum operation cost. An overestimate of resources suffers from unnecessary excess capital cost, which might not be feasible. On the other hand, an underestimate of resources builds an unreliable VPP. It is a multi-objective complex problem considering the minimization of capital and operation costs as objectives, subject to many constraints, including net zero emission. Moreover, an intelligent energy management system (EMS) is deployed considering present and near future dynamic forecasted demand profile, state of charge (SoC) of storage, and power availability from renewables for reliability, and maintains net zero energy and emission. All the dispatch and transaction communications in VPP are committed to using blockchain. This paper uses an intelligent multi-objective strategy to design and optimize a generalized VPP model. Historical wind speed, solar radiation, and load profiles over a long period are used as inputs for the model. An intelligent energy management system for the dispatch of resources is carried out. Results will show that the proposed method can build an effective VPP considering costs, emissions, efficiency, and reliability.

The analysis on charging demands of EVs is the basis of the study of influences on power grid and charging infrastructures planning. Charging demand calculation is based on the precise analysis on the driving law of users. This study proposes a method based on the stochastic simulation of trip chain to solve the existing problem. First, the concept and characteristic variables (trip start time, driving time, parking duration, driving distance and trip purpose) of trip chain are introduced. Second, the probability distribution models of these variables are established considering their correlative relationships. Third, using Monte Carlo method, the complete trip chains are simulated, and then the spatial-temporal distributions of charging demands are calculated. Finally, based on the National household trip survey data, and according to the proposed method, charging demands in different areas are studied. The results show that the proposed method can accurately simulate the driving law of users and reflect spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of charging demands, and different charging scenarios will lead to different forms of charging demand distribution, which will exert different impacts on power system.

J	Amini, MH; Kargarian, A; Karabasoglu, O				Amini, M. Hadi; Kargarian, Amin; Karabasoglu, Orkun			ARIMA-based decoupled time series forecasting of electric vehicle charging demand for stochastic power system operation	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								Large-scale utilization of electric vehicles (EVs) affects the total electricity demand considerably. Demand forecast is usually designed for the seasonally changing load patterns. However, with the high penetration of EVs, daily charging demand makes traditional forecasting methods less accurate. This paper presents an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method for demand forecasting of conventional electrical load (CEL) and charging demand of EV (CDE) parking lots simultaneously. Our EV charging demand prediction model takes daily driving patterns and distances as an input to determine the expected charging load profiles. The parameters of the ARIMA model are tuned so that the mean square error (MSE) of the forecaster is minimized. We improve the accuracy of ARIMA forecaster by optimizing the integrated and auto-regressive order parameters. Furthermore, due to the different seasonal and daily pattern of CEL and CDE, the proposed decoupled demand forecasting method provides significant improvement in terms of error reduction. The impact of EV charging demand on the accuracy of the proposed load forecaster is also analyzed in two approaches: (1) integrated forecaster for CEL + CDE, and (2) decoupled forecaster that targets CEL and CDE independently. The forecaster outputs are used to formulate a chance-constrained day-ahead scheduling problem. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed forecaster and its influence on the stochastic power system operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Amini, M.

J	Munawar, U; Wang, ZL				Munawar, Usman; Wang, Zhanle			Coordinated integration of distributed energy resources in unit commitment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								Distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles and roof-top solar panels have become increasingly popular and essential components of power distribution systems. However, their growth poses significant challenges to system operation, such as bidirectional power flow, intermittent power generation, increased peak demand, and unexpected frequency/voltage fluctuation. To tackle these challenges, we developed a vehicle-to -grid model, which incorporated dynamic electric vehicles usages, such as driving times, driving distance, and charging/discharging locations. The machine learning method of principal component analysis and XGBoost were used to develop the solar energy prediction model. We also developed a novel unit commitment model to coordinate and aggregate the distributed energy resources in power generation economic dispatch. Electric vehicle charging was used as elastic demand and electric vehicle discharging was used as power generation sources. The solar energy was considered as a negative load. Simulation results showed that uncontrolled electric vehicle charging and solar energy could negatively impact the power systems. For example, the load ramping rate was increased by 384%. Simulation results also showed that the proposed models could mitigate the negative impact and improve energy efficiency. For example, the peak demand, load ramping rate and average generation cost were reduced by 21%, 79%, and 27%.

Next, to increase the pure EV's driving range, an energy efficient optimal control framework based on dynamic traffic information flow was proposed, which includes the traffic information layer, the target planning layer, and the prediction and control layer. In the traffic information layer, the vehicle receives and updates the traffic information data. The time-domain information and distance domain information are converted in the target planning layer and the optimal state-of-charge (SOC) reference trajectory is planned through the remote cloud computing system. The traffic information is predicted in the prediction and control layer, and an SOC scroll tracking control method is proposed to continuously control the power system to achieve the goal of optimal energy consumption and economic driving. Finally, under a variety of real road simulation conditions with dynamic traffic information, we verify that the economic performance of the proposed control framework is equivalent to that of the one based on dynamic programming algorithms and has the potential for online real-time control.

J	Khalid, M; Akram, U; Shafiq, S				Khalid, Muhammad; Akram, Umer; Shafiq, Saifullah			Optimal Planning of Multiple Distributed Generating Units and Storage in Active Distribution Networks	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Traditionally, the energy supply in off-grid communities has relied on diesel generating units based microgrids (MGs) but global environmental concerns and advancements in renewable energy technology are pushing for the transformation of these systems into renewable-based MGs. This transformation is a more complex hybrid system, with dispatchable and non-dispatchable resources, and requires novel planning and design tools to ensure the security of supply in the future. This paper presents a methodology that jointly optimizes the capacities and locations of dispatchable and non-dispatchable distributed generating units and battery energy storage system employed in a stand-alone MG serving conventional residential and electric vehicle charging load. The complex dual optimization problem is solved innovatively in two sequential steps. In the first step, the capacities of solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, battery energy storage system, and diesel generator are determined without actually considering the system design itself. While in the second step, a novel and simple methodology is developed which determines the sub-optimal capacities of distributed generation units along with their actual locations in the distribution system. To determine the optimal locations of distributed generation units, we defined a novel factor, losses-voltage-factor (LVF), which ensures reduced losses and better voltage quality. The proposed methodology gives a robust design that not only results in reduced losses and better voltage quality but also have higher reliability. The proposed technique is very practical, which can easily be applied for the planning and design of the practical active distribution networks.

Consequently, using deterministic power flow (DPF) algorithms for EVCS planning is unreliable. To address this, we propose a probabilistic model for EV charging loads and introduce a novel dynamic system voltage stability (DSVS) index. We then present an effective optimization model for EVCS site and size planning using stochastic power flow (SPF). Our model aims to maximize capital gains on investment costs of EVCS, minimize yearly EV users' average wait time and distance to charge costs, and minimize the DSVS index. To simplify the problem, we use the super efficiency data envelopment analysis (SEDEA) method to determine objective weights and transform the multiobjective optimization problem into a single-objective one. Finally, we jointly solve the model using the voronoi diagram and adaptive differential evolution optimization algorithm (ADEOA). We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method using a case study with the IEEE 33-node distribution network topology diagram and a planning area diagram.

This development has triggered new and increasing challenges in the distribution system planning and operation, whereby the distribution systems must adapt to the increased share of DERs. However, EVs may also offer new opportunities and can be used to support the grid by providing several local and global power- and energy-based services. This paper presents a review and classification of the services potentially available from EVs for distribution systems, referred to as EV distribution system services (EV-DSS). A detailed description of recent services and approaches is given, and an assessment of the maturity of EV-DSS is provided. Moreover, challenges and prospects for future research are identified, considering key topics, such as the design of the market framework, economic assessment, battery degradation, and the impacts of the transmission system operator service provision by EVs on distribution networks. Thus, this paper offers a tool for stakeholders concerning services available from EVs and provides a broad literature framework that can be used as a base for further investigations. It is aligned with the current requirements to move toward the realistic implementations of EV-DSS.

In practice, the co-optimization problem for power-transportation systems can be overly complicated due to a great deal of uncertainty and many decision variables rooted in the EV population and mobile energy storage. Another challenge is the heterogeneity in terms of size and supporting capability due to various types of such mobile entities. This work aims to facilitate power-transportation co-optimization by proposing and formalizing the concept of Circulating Loads (CirLoads) to generalize these spatial-temporal dispatchable entities. With the new concept, the stochastic process of CirLoads' movement is introduced using Brownian particles for the first time. Such novel particle motion-based modeling for EVs can reflect their stochastic behaviors over time without requiring exact data of EVs. The distributions of CirLoads are further aggregated with Gaussian Mixture Models to reduce the dimensions. Based on this aggregated model, a co-optimization framework is proposed to coordinate the bulk of EVs while respecting data privacy between transportation and power systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

J	Son, YG; Acquah, MA; Kim, SY				Son, Yeong Geon; Acquah, Moses Amoasi; Kim, Sung-Yul			Optimal hierarchical modeling of power to X stations through a chance constrained Two-Stage stochastic programming	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The carbon neutrality policy aiming for net zero carbon emissions has led to a significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources (RES) globally. However, due to their uncertain nature, RES can cause imbalances in power demand. Recently, Power-to-X (P2X) station technology has gained attention as a solution to the uncertainties of RES and as a means to enhance the capacity and efficiency of RES operations. P2X stations can be utilized when power demand imbalances occur due to the uncertain output of RES or when the power system cannot accommodate the power supply from RES due to various stability issues. Specifically, when supply disruptions occur in the power system due to RES uncertainties, P2X stations contribute to preventing RES curtailment by supplying power to electric vehicle (EV) fuel sources, producing heat using electric heat pumps (EHP), or producing hydrogen using electrolyzers (ELZ), thus improving the uncertain financial benefits for independent power producers (IPP). This paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based chance-constrained two-stage stochastic optimization (CCTS) approach to address imbalances in power demand from RES and to enhance the profitability of IPP by finding the optimal planning and operational solutions for P2X stations. The proposed method provides hierarchical level results, demonstrating that economic benefits can increase by up to 60.2% with the application of P2X stations and that curtailed energy from RES can be reduced by up to 76.5%. The proposed methodology is also validated for its superior performance by being compared with both the non-linear stochastic chance constraint method and the stochastic method.

The electrification of transportation, however, is going to have a much larger impact on utility planning and operations, essentially transforming utilities into providers of foundational mobility-related services. The speed of electric vehicle (EV) adoption is increasing and is an order of magnitude faster than the pace at which utilities build new distribution and transmission infrastructure. EV adoption scenarios must be sufficiently accurate, granular, and specific to identify critical grid investment needs.

J	Li, XF; Li, C; Jia, C				Li, Xiaofei; Li, Chi; Jia, Chen			Electric Vehicle and Photovoltaic Power Scenario Generation under Extreme High-Temperature Weather	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								In recent years, with the intensification of global warming, extreme weather has become more frequent, intensifying the uncertainty of new energy output and load power, and seriously affecting the safe operation of power systems. Scene generation is an effective method to solve the uncertainty problem of stochastic planning of integrated systems of new energy generation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scenario generation and scenario reduction model of photovoltaic (PV) output and electric vehicle (EV) load power under extreme weather based on the copula function. Firstly, the non-parametric kernel density estimation method is used to fit a large number of sample data. The kernel density estimation expressions of PV and EV powers under extreme weather conditions are obtained and the corresponding goodness of fit tests are carried out. Then, a variety of joint distribution models based on the copula function are established to judge the goodness of fit of each model, and the optimal copula function is selected as the joint probability distribution function by combining the Kendall and Spearman correlation coefficients of each model. Finally, the optimal copula joint probability distribution is used to generate PV and EV power scenarios. The data of extremely hot weather in a certain province were selected for an example analysis. The results show that the output scenario obtained conforms to the correlation under this extreme weather, and has higher accuracy in reflecting the actual PV output and load power in this province under this extreme weather, which can provide a reference for reliability analyses of power systems and power grid planning.

Traditionally, power distribution system takes a long time to recover after a major blackout, due to its top-down operation strategy. New technologies in modern distribution systems bring opportunities and challenges to distribution system restoration. As fast response energy resources, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can accelerate the load pickup by compensating the imbalance between available generation and distribution system load. This study provides a bottom-up restoration strategy to use PHEVs for reliable load pickup and faster restoration process. The optimisation problem of finding load pickup sequence to maximise restored energy is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Moreover, the coordination between transmission and distribution restoration is developed to efficiently restore the entire system back to normal operating conditions. Simulation results on one 100-feeder test system demonstrate the efficiency of MILP-based restoration strategy and the benefit from PHEVs to restore more energy in given restoration time. The proposed restoration strategy has great potential to facilitate system operators to achieve efficient system restoration plans. It also provides incentives to deploy a large amount of PHEVs to improve system resiliency.

In this paper, the potential performance of Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS), consisting of the battery and supercapacitor, in mitigating fluctuations in shipboard electrical network has been investigated based on the simulation model. To achieve a cooperative control among the three-source powertrains (i.e., the generation set system, Li-ion battery, and supercapacitor), a power distribution strategy is proposed. Considering that the power distribution and capacity sizing of HESS are highly related to each other, a multi-objective joint optimization method based on Multi-objective pelican optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal number of Li-ion battery and supercapacitor and the optimal power distribution strategy among the three-source powertrain for adverse sea conditions. The results indicate that the HESS can effectively mitigate fluctuations in frequency and voltage of AC bus, which are caused by the power supply side and/or the load side. Compared to the original IPS (without HESS), the fluctuations amplitude of frequency and voltage for the proposed IPS with optimal HESS are reduced by 63.0% and 74.5% in adverse sea conditions, effectively improving the electricity quality and safety of the ship. Moreover, compared to traditional optimization methods, the investment cost and installation space for the proposed IPS with optimal HESS are reduced by 53.9% and 54.2% respectively.

In this context, a multistage low-carbon EV CFs planning model is proposed in this paper for the coupled transportation and power systems. This model not only takes into account the construction costs of newly-built CFs and their adverse impacts on the distribution system, but also considers the carbon emissions of CFs and the penalty due to the inconvenience for EVs to be recharged. In addition, a rational travel route choice model is significantly important to accurately evaluate the service capability of CFs to be constructed and thereby to obtain an optimal CF planning result. Therefore, a novel travel route choice model developed in this work allows EV drivers to take detours according to the CF locations to charge their EVs multiple times and then finish their trips. Carbon emission flow (CEF) model is innovatively employed to precisely calculate CFs' carbon emission amount from the perspective of consumption side. Subsequently, uncertainties involved in CF planning, i.e., distribution and growth rate of traffic flow and electric load, popularity of different types of EVs, as well as location of the connected node of clean electricity, are fully considered to obtain a robust CF planning scheme that can achieve a good performance in the current stage and exhibit robustness for the uncertainties in the future stage. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The impacts of future carbon price and EV cruising range on the planning results are also comprehensively evaluated.

In modern electric power systems, the integration of EVCS and DG must be carefully planned. Inappropriate sizing and location of EVCS can cause network overload, increase power losses, and allow for voltage variations outside the standard. This study adopts a reference distribution network that is representative of a typical business distribution network in a metropolitan city in Indonesia. To resolve the issue of determining the size and location of EVCS, the hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm algorithm (HGAMSSA) optimization method with multi-objective function is implemented. There are three scenarios used when determining the size and placement of EVCS. In the first scenario, the EVCS comprises chargers at levels 1, 2, and 3, with DG integration. In the second scenario, EVCS is comprised of level 2 and level 3, with DG integration. While in the third scenario, EVCS only consists of level 3 chargers with DG integration. The simulation results indicate that network utilization can be optimized at 79.00%, 75.53%, and 76.37% when electric cars (EV) operate in grid to vehicle (G2V) mode, compared to a base load of 29.46%. In vehicle to grid (V2G) mode, the energy supplied by the electric vehicle (EV) via the EVCS is 0.91 MWh. Additionally, the distribution network receives 10.036 MWh of electricity from rooftop photovoltaic (PV).

Real-time operations, depending on wind and photovoltaic solar power, baseload demand and EV demand variability, are taken into account in the second stage. The proposed model considers conventional generators and alternating current (AC) linearized power flow constraints. Besides, a detailed ESS operation is considered, including degradation costs, and nonlinear charging/discharging as well as efficiency variation dependent of state of charge (SOC), for lead-acid and lithium-ion technologies. EV demand behavior is generated by probability-based algorithms that use the Monte Carlo method to perform their simulations, which are based on data of initial SOC, plugin/out times, type of EVs, and chargers. Finally, the proposed model is successfully validated with an IEEE-37 bus system. The results support the superiority of the proposed model over existing works, showing significant variations in battery bank (BB) operation. The computational time is similar to previous works, despite adding new constraints that increase the complexity.

J	Xia, MC; Xian, YM; Chen, QF				Xia, Mingchao; Xian, Yiming; Chen, Qifang			Collaborative Planning for Hybrid Refueling Stations With PV Power in Highway Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS				Article								Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are ideal technologies for highway transport to achieve zero emissions, and their widespread adoption in highway networks require sufficient available hybrid refueling stations (HRSs). However, existing planning models for HRSs tend to focus on the interior of the city, the research on the planning of HRSs in highway networks, as well as the optimal allocation of hydrogen that can exist between HRSs is usually ignored. This article proposed a collaborative planning method for HRSs in highway networks that included photovoltaic (PV) and hydrogen allocation. First, based on the Floyd algorithm and the Monte Carlo algorithm, this article proposed a charging demand simulation method for HRSs in highway networks. Then we proposed an HRSs energy allocation method using hydrogen as backup mobile energy which aims to realize the cross-space energy dispatch of multi-site PV power generation and improve the energy supply reliability of the HRSs. Finally, based on the above research, considering the safety constraints of the power system along the highway network and the installed capacity constraints of the PV power generation system, we proposed an HRSs planning model including electric-hydrogen conversion devices and storage systems. This method minimizes the transportation cost of hydrogen by rationally planning the amount of hydrogen tube trailers (HTTs) and transportation routes, realizes cross-space energy scheduling of multi-site PV power generation, and thereby improving the energy supply reliability of HRSs and the consumption rate of PV power generation. The case study indicates that compared with the traditional method, the planning method proposed in this article reduces the operating cost by 32.5%, and the total cost decreases by 8.5%, with the PV power consumption rate along the highway network also improved to a certain extent.

J	Feng, JZ; Hu, ZC; Duan, XY				Feng, Jianzhou; Hu, Zechun; Duan, Xiaoyu			EV Fast Charging Station Planning Considering Competition Based on Stochastic Dynamic Equilibrium	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS				Article; Proceedings Paper								The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and the deployment of fast charging infrastructures bring considerable impacts on the planning and operation of power systems. Integrating photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) with fast charging station (FCS) can alleviate the negative impacts and bring benefits to both power system operation and charging service provider. In this paper, an integrated procedure is proposed for the charging service provider to optimally plan fast charging stations integrated with PV and ESS in urban area, while taking the influence of its competitors, EV users' decision-making psychology, the uncertainties of charging demand and PV power output into consideration. Firstly, a charging demand estimationmethod based on average travel speed is presented. Secondly, a stochastic dynamic user choice equilibrium (SDUCE) model and its solution algorithm based on method of successive averages (MSA) are proposed. The model considers the key factors influencing the charging decision of EV users as well as the uncertainty of their perceptions of utility values. In addition, the time-varying queuing time and the temporal coupling among EVs arriving at a charging station in different time periods are also considered. Thirdly, based on the equilibrium model, a multi-scenario benefit maximization model is built from the perspective of charging service provider, and solved by genetic algorithm. Finally, a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) planning model based on the Wasserstein-metric is formulated to determine the capacities of PV and ESS. The proposed planning method is tested using real traffic data of ShenzhenCity. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Alghamdi, AAM; Jayaweera, D				Alghamdi, Abdullah Ali M.; Jayaweera, Dilan			Electric Boats and Electric Vehicles Data-Driven Approach for Enhanced Resilience in Power Distribution Networks	IEEE ACCESS				Article								This paper proposes a novel hierarchical optimization framework to enhance power distribution network resilience against extreme events by incorporating electric boats (E-Boats) as complementary assets to electric vehicles (EVs). Unlike EVs reliant on potentially compromised roadways, E-Boats navigate unaffected waterways, offering superior resilience during disaster response in regions with rivers and canals. The approach employs a two-phase methodology evaluated on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder with actual infrastructure data, enabling large-scale integration of non-pre-determined EVs/E-Boats. Phase-I emphasizes proactive planning and anticipatory optimization, leveraging extensive data integration and a developed exchange architecture enabling efficient EV/E-Boat distribution through novel selection and pairing algorithms. Phase-II focuses on adaptive restoration and coordination optimization by employing sophisticated model layers. These include advanced EV and E-Boat dispatch models that use changing geospatial data to approximate motion conditions and charging/discharging requirements, enabling energy-efficient and optimized dispatch. Detailed simulations with comprehensive performance analysis demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superiority in achieving optimal solutions within shorter computational times. This work presents an effective solution for enhancing power network resilience using a combined EV/E-Boat network with geospatial data for EV and E-Boat locations, state-of-charge updates, and adaptive path optimization algorithms. Results highlight faster restoration, minimized costs, and reduced energy consumption.

However, the incorporation of the latter in system planning has yet to be comprehensively investigated. This paper proposes a novel planning model that allows co-optimizing the investment and operating costs of conventional generation assets and demand flexibility, in the form of smart-charging/discharging electric vehicles (EV). The model includes a detailed representation of EV operational constraints along with the generation technical characteristics, and accounts for the costs required to enable demand flexibility. Computational tractability is achieved through clustering generation units and EV, which allows massively reducing the number of decision variables and constraints, and avoiding non-linearities. Case studies in the context of the U.K. demonstrate the economic value of EV flexibility in reducing peak demand levels and absorbing wind generation variability, and the dependence of this value on the required enabling cost and users' traveling patterns.

This paper presents a strategy for optimizing the placement of flood resilient Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) to enhance the resilience of PDSs during critical events by leveraging Electric Vehicles (EVs). The methodology begins by establishing a traffic network in Klang, Malaysia, utilizing the professional transport modeling software PTV Visum to simulate EV evacuation during flood event.

J	Rahmani, M; Hosseinian, SH; Abedi, M				Rahmani, Mojtaba; Hosseinian, Seyed Hossein; Abedi, Mehrdad			Optimal integration of Demand Response Programs and electric vehicles into the SCUC	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) is carried out by power system operators to determine the optimal participation of generating units to meet the load demand while satisfying units' and systems' constraints as well as the desired level of security. With technological advances in the realm of communications and development in the infrastructure, a proper environment for the active contribution of customers has been formed. This new structure has enabled the consumers to play a vital role in the market via Demand Response Programs (DRPs) and coordinated aggregated Plug-In Electric Vehicle (PEV) fleets. These new resources could be a merit for the power system provided that they are employed correctly and in coordination with the rest of the system. The SCUC is where DRPs and PEVs could be optimally addressed to exploit their full potential. This paper tackles the problem of SCUC in the presence of DRPs and aggregated PEV fleets. The objective is to lessen the operation cost provided that all constraints are satisfied. Different constraints including those related to the system, units, transmission system, DRPs, and PEVs as well as the security constraints are taken into consideration. The SCUC is modeled as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem and an appropriate model of PEVs is derived to facilitate the integration of these resources into the grid while considering their charging and discharging characteristics as well as efficiency. Moreover, a suitable model of DRPs is introduced in this study based on the concept of price elasticity of demand. The proposed approach is practiced over the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System (RTS) to analyze the effect of the smart grid on SCUC. Obtained results demonstrate that with proper deployment of DRPs and PEVs the operation cost could be lessened while the security of the system is improved. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional AC power systems can scarcely meet the development demand of new DC trends, especially since both the generation side and load side are comprised of DC-based electronic power components. With this background, low voltage direct current supply and utilization system (LVDCSUS) has attracted more and more attention for its great advantages over an AC grid to overcome challenges in operation, reliability, and energy loss in renewable energy connection, DC load power utilization and a number of other aspects. However, the definition of the LVDCSUS is still not clear even though many demonstration projects have been put into planning and operation. In order to provide a clear description of LVDCSUS, first, the characteristics of LVDCSUS are illustrated in this paper to show the advance of the LVDCSUS. Second, the potential application scenarios of LVDCSUS are presented in this paper. Third, application of LVDCSUS technologies and some demonstration projects in China are introduced. Besides the development of the LVDCSUS, key technologies, including but not limited to planning and design, voltage levels, control strategies, and key equipment of LVDCSUS, are discussed in this paper. Finally, future application areas and the research orientations of LVDCSUS are analyzed.

This paper analyzes the impacts of DLC programs on the transition to renewable energy within the European electricity system towards 2060. The study quantifies the achievable hourly potential for DLC across Europe in the residential sector. By implementing and developing a DLC module within the stochastic capacity expansion model EMPIRE, we investigate how costs, long-term investments, and long-term marginal prices are affected by residential DLC participation rates. The research utilizes a comprehensive DLC dataset, including ten appliances such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, refrigeration, and others. This dataset serves as the basis for creating four storylines to investigate the integration of these programs into the European electricity system. The results indicate that residential DLC programs have some impact on grid -battery deployment, PV plant penetration, and electricity prices. In the best -case scenario, involving ambitious participation of residential loads in DLC programs without compensation, cost savings are about 1% versus not introducing DLC. The findings contribute to understanding the value of demand response programs in Europe, indicating that the savings they bring might not be sufficient to provide enough incentives or compensation for widespread participation in such programs. That is, from a long-term investment or capacity expansion perspective, it may not be worthwhile to soley include residential demand response in the planning of the electricity system.

J	Eltamaly, AM				Eltamaly, Ali M.			Optimal Dispatch Strategy for Electric Vehicles in V2G Applications	SMART CITIES				Article								The overutilization of electric vehicles (EVs) has the potential to result in significant challenges regarding the reliability, contingency, and standby capabilities of traditional power systems. The utilization of renewable energy distributed generator (REDG) presents a potential solution to address these issues. By incorporating REDG, the reliance of EV charging power on conventional energy sources can be diminished, resulting in significant reductions in transmission losses and enhanced capacity within the traditional power system. The effective management of the REDG necessitates intelligent coordination between the available generation capacity of the REDG and the charging and discharging power of EVs. Furthermore, the utilization of EVs as a means of energy storage is facilitated through the integration of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Despite the importance of the V2G technology for EV owners and electric utility, it still has a slow progress due to the distrust of the revenue model that can encourage the EV owners and the electric utility as well to participate in V2G programs. This study presents a new wear model that aims to precisely assess the wear cost of EV batteries, resulting from their involvement in V2G activities. The proposed model seeks to provide EV owners with a precise understanding of the potential revenue they might obtain from participating in V2G programs, hence encouraging their active engagement in such initiatives. Various EV battery wear models are employed and compared. Additionally, this study introduces a novel method for optimal charging scheduling, which aims to effectively manage the charging and discharging patterns of EVs by utilizing a day-ahead pricing technique. This study presents a novel approach, namely, the gradual reduction of swarm size with the grey wolf optimization (GRSS-GWO) algorithm, for determining the optimal hourly charging/discharging power with short convergence time and the highest accuracy based on maximizing the profit of EV owners.

J	Zhou, BW; Littler, T				Zhou, Bowen; Littler, Tim			Local storage meets local demand: a technical solution to future power distribution system	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				Article								Future power systems are expected to integrate large-scale stochastic and intermittent generation and load due to reduced use of fossil fuel resources, including renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EV). Inclusion of such resources poses challenges for the dynamic stability of synchronous transmission and distribution networks, not least in terms of generation where system inertia may not be wholly governed by large-scale generation but displaced by small-scale and localised generation. Energy storage systems (ESS) can limit the impact of dispersed and distributed generation by offering supporting reserve while accommodating large-scale EV connection; the latter (load) also participating in storage provision. In this study, a local energy storage system (LESS) is proposed. The structure, requirement and optimal sizing of the LESS are discussed. Three operating modes are detailed, including: (i) storage pack management; (ii) normal operation; and (iii) contingency operation. The proposed LESS scheme is evaluated using simulation studies based on data obtained from the Northern Ireland regional and residential network.

In this paper, we study these benefits of PEV charging, demonstrating that controlled PEV charging can reduce costs associated with wind uncertainty and variability. Interestingly, we show that the system does not require complete control of PEV-charging loads to mitigate the negative cost impacts of wind variability and uncertainty. Rather, PEV owners giving the system a two-hour window of flexibility in which to recharge their vehicles provides much of the benefits that giving full charging control does.

This paper proposes a novel sensitivity analysis-based FCS planning approach, which considers the voltage sensitivity of each sub-network in the distribution network and charging service availability for EV drivers in the transportation network. In addition, energy storage systems are optimally installed to provide voltage regulation service and enhance charging capacity. Simulation tests conducted on two distribution network and transportation network coupled systems validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

A method for predicting the expected demand pattern at these HREVCs is presented in this paper. This is critical to plan a network of chargers.

Analysis of electric vehicle charging using the traditional generation expansion planning analysis tool WASP-IV	JOURNAL OF MODERN POWER SYSTEMS AND CLEAN ENERGY				Article								Electric vehicles (EV) are proposed as a measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport and support increased wind power penetration across modern power systems. Optimal benefits can only be achieved, if EVs are deployed effectively, so that the exhaust emissions are not substituted by additional emissions in the electricity sector, which can be implemented using Smart Grid controls. This research presents the results of an EV roll-out in the all island grid (AIG) in Ireland using the long term generation expansion planning model called the Wien Automatic System Planning IV (WASP-IV) tool to measure carbon dioxide emissions and changes in total energy. The model incorporates all generators and operational requirements while meeting environmental emissions, fuel availability and generator operational and maintenance constraints to optimize economic dispatch and unit commitment power dispatch.

However, to consider the vehicle-to-home (V2H) and home-to-vehicle (H2V) capabilities, new energy control strategy has to be developed to avoid new peaks consumption. This paper presents a novel controller based on fuzzy logic, which integrates an objective state-of-charge (SoC) for V2H application. The V2H capability is used when the PHEV is connected to the home to help the grid to meet the household loads during peak period. The SoC objective is the minimum SoC that the PHEV has to have when the driver connects the PHEV to the home. The proposed controller is applied on fourth different scenario.

J	Xie, JH; Vorobev, P; Yang, RF; Nguyen, HD				Xie, Jiahang; Vorobev, Petr; Yang, Rufan; Nguyen, Hung Dinh			Battery Health-Informed and Policy-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for EV-Facilitated Distribution Grid Optimal Policy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				Article								Electric vehicles play a crucial role in modern active distribution system operation, owing to their flexibility and mobility. The joint optimization of power grid operation and EV scheduling is expected to achieve better decision-making for both power and transportation systems. However, such joint optimization can suffer from high computational complexity and a lack of information about the other system. One possible approach for the power system operator is to assume the charging/discharging pattern of the EV population and make dispatch decisions based on such estimated EV profiles. This practice results in grid-level policies. The problem arises as whether the EV population complies with and fulfills the grid-level policies is not easy to monitor. To address this issue, we further investigate and expand upon the innovative concept of grid facilitation for electric vehicles (EVs). A newly designed probabilistic incentive signal is introduced to assist in implementing grid policies. Correspondingly, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for EV prosumer scheduling that effectively balances EV autonomy with the execution of grid policies. Cast as a demand response signal, the grid-level policy is capable of managing overall grid operation with the facilitation of individuals and decoupling the co-optimization of the operator and EV owner. For the DRL of the EV, the training reward considers both the EV operation cost and the grid facilitation incentive, featuring a dynamically shrinking EV battery's feasible operation range in terms of voltages and currents, and the health-informed reward. The policy-aware reward utilizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify the gap between the actual EV power injection pattern and the system operator's assumption. Invalid action mask tricks are integrated to prevent infeasible actions for EVs. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the facilitation effect of EV on system operation planning.

In traditional systems, invest-ment in the generation expansion was made by the electricity company, but with the restructuring in the electricity industry, the owners of different parts of the system submit their proposals to the independent system operator and the independent system operator chooses the optimal design. Slowly increasing energy production from renewable sources can pose challenges for the grid. Increasing the penetration of renewable resources due to uncertainty in their production can reduce network reliability and thus increase system costs. The investi-gation on generation expansion planning is a multifaceted issue (technical and economic) that has been analyzed in various aspects in recent years. In this study, a multidimensional structure of generation expansion planning based on increasing the penetration level of distributed generation resources (renewable and non-renewable) as well as the application of load management and demand response algorithms is proposed. The proposed model is scheduled based on two levels of primary and secondary development. In the primary, the development of generation and transmission based on large-scale power plants as well as solar and wind farms are presented. In the secondary, in order to reduce the power fluctuations caused by the distributed generation's units, non- stochastic power generation units such as micro turbines, gas turbines and combined heat and power have been utilized. To overcome the difficulties in solving the problem of hybrid and non-convergent mixed-integer problem, the adaptive particle swarm optimization has been hired. The simulation results indicate that in the second scenario, where the development of the generation expansion planning is based on the integration of distributed generation resources and power plants, it is more cost-effective. In addition to, these simulation results represent the accuracy of the proposed probabilistic method in planning of dynamic generation systems in order to estimate the probability density function and the optimal output variables in multi-objective techno- economic planning.

We formulate adaptive EV charging as a feasibility problem that meets all EVs' energy demands before their deadlines while satisfying constraints in charging rate and total charging power. We propose an online algorithm, smoothed least-laxity-first (sLLF), that decides the current charging rates without the knowledge of future arrivals and demands. We characterize the performance of the sLLF algorithm analytically and numerically. Numerical experiments with real-world data show that it has a significantly higher rate of feasible EV charging than several other existing EV charging algorithms. Resource augmentation framework is employed to assess the feasibility condition of the algorithm. The assessment shows that the sLLF algorithm achieves perfect feasibility with only a 7% increase in the maximal power supply of the charging station.

The system value of optimized battery electric vehicle charging: a case study in South Africa	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING				Article								This study quantified the impact of future battery electric vehicle (EV) charging on the least-cost electricity generation portfolio in South Africa (RSA). This was done by performing a capacity expansion optimization of the generation fleet for the year 2040. It was assumed that there would be 2.8 million EVs by 2040, informed by global estimates. Two EV charging scenarios were tested, one using an aggregated fixed charging profile based on existing literature and another where the charging demand was optimized by the power system based on least cost. The results showed that additional capacity was required to meet the demand. For both scenarios, the least-cost capacity investment technologies chosen were the same, although the quantities differed. This indicates that the least-cost technology choice was robust against the charging profiles. The optimized charging profile led to lower system costs and a slightly higher energy share from solar relative to the fixed charging case.

Conventional offline optimization algorithms lack real-time applicability due to uncertainties involved in the charging service of an EV charging station (EVCS). Firstly, an optimization model for real-time EV charging strategy is proposed to address these challenges, which accounts for environmental uncertainties of an EVCS, encompassing EV arrivals, charging demands, PVG outputs, and the electricity price. Then, a scenario-based two-stage optimization approach is formulated. The scenarios of the underlying uncertain environmental factors are generated by the Bayesian long short-term memory (B-LSTM) network. Finally, numerical results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed optimization approach, and demonstrate superior profitability compared with prevalent approaches.

To overcome the poor forecasting accuracy associated with limited available data, this research proposes a time-series-based hybrid transfer learning forecasting approach, namely CNN-BiLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network - Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) to forecast EV charging profile. Additionally, the proposed algorithm has been applied to forecast network voltage from the EV data without performing power flow.

J	Gao, S; Jia, HJ				Gao, Shuang; Jia, Hongjie			Integrated Configuration and Optimization of Electric Vehicle Aggregators for Charging Facilities in Power Networks With Renewables	IEEE ACCESS				Article								This paper investigates the optimal configuration and control of electric vehicle aggregators equipped with smart meters in the regional power distribution network. The mixed optimization of configuration and control is originally formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with the stochastic operation model of EV aggregations. The controllable charging load is calculated by using a queuing model with non-homogeneous Poission process and integrated into the reliability constrained economic dispatch of the power system. Benders decomposition technique is adopted to lessen the dimensional and computational complexities introduced by the charging control of massive EVs. The total operating cost is minimized in the master problem, and charging plan for each individual EV is made by EVA in the sub-problems.

J	Akram, U; Khalid, M; Shafiq, S				Akram, Umer; Khalid, Muhammad; Shafiq, Salfullah			An Improved Optimal Sizing Methodology for Future Autonomous Residential Smart Power Systems	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Accelerated development of eco-friendly technologies, such as renewable energy (RE), smart grids, and electric transportation will shape the future of electric power generation and supply. The power consumption characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible and easily controllable, which will also affect the sizing of power generation system. This paper presents a methodology for the joint capacity optimization of a typical residential standalone microgrid (MG) employing RE sources, i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WTs), diesel generators (DGs), and battery energy storage system (BESS). The MG supplies a residential community load comprising of typical residential load plus electric vehicles (EVs) charging load. The realistic mathematical models of PV, WT, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load are formulated to improve the capacity optimization methodology, which involves various realistic constraints associated with the RE sources, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load. The labyrinthine optimization problem is formulated and solved innovatively to 1) minimize the cost; 2) reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; and 3) curtail dump energy. All three objectives have special significance in designing a standalone MG, for example, cost is related to the economics, GHG emissions deal with global warming, and dump energy is related to the stability and economics of the system. The optimization problem is solved for different possible combinations of PV, WT, DG, and BESS to determine the best possible combination to serve the load effectively and economically. In addition, the impact of load shifting on the sizes of distributed generators and BESS in terms of per-unit cost and GHG emissions is analyzed using the concept of controllable loads. This study could be assumed as a powerful roadmap for decision makers, analysts, and policy makers.

A New Time-Decoupled Framework for PEVs Charging and Scheduling in Industrial Microgrids	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				Article								Solving the optimal power flow (OPF) in industrial microgrids (IMGs) in presence of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) changes the structure of problem to a complex dynamic OPF (DOPF). The complication is due to energy and time related constraints of PEVs that requires the complex nonlinear time-coupled DOPF problem to be solved over a long period of few hours (e.g., 24-h). This paper presents a novel time-decoupled framework for solving the generation scheduling problem in IMGs by relaxing the time correlated constraints of the DOPE The relaxation is mathematically achieved by replacing the time-coupled constraints with their corresponding long term time averages. This will resolve the time coupling property of DOPF and results in a simpler solution approach. The relaxed DOPF problem can be solved in independent time periods while considering other constraints such as PEVs and security constraints of OPF as well as factories constraints. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, different simulation scenarios have been applied to an 18-bus IMG consisting of PEVs and 12 factories with electrical and thermal loads as well as combined heat and power systems.

However, the operation mechanism and the uncertainty management in the process still lack research. Aiming at this issue, this paper proposes a day-ahead bidding strategy for the battery swapping and charging system (BSCS) providing regulation reserve capacity in the ancillary service market. Firstly, a new BSCS-based regulation model is established. Then, an ambiguity set based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used to manage the uncertainty of regulation signals and battery swapping demands. Furthermore, a boundary expectation approach is proposed to turn the problem into robust optimization. Finally, after using the extreme scenario method (ESM) to generate extreme scenarios, a duality-free column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is employed to solve the problem. The case studies demonstrate that BSCS can provide economical and robust reserve capacity bidding plans in the day-ahead market with the proposed strategy. At the same time, the BSCS-based regulation service is simulated with the battery development trend in the future, and suggestions are given.

We develop a closed-form model for PEV fast-charging stations' service abilities, which considers heterogeneous PEV driving ranges and charging demands. We utilize a modified capacitated flow refueling location model based on subpaths (CFRLM_SP) to explicitly capture time-varying PEV charging demands on the transportation network under driving range constraints. We explore extra constraints of the CFRLM_SP to enhance model accuracy and computational efficiency. We then propose a stochastic mixed-integer second-order cone programming model for PEV fast-charging station planning. The model considers the transportation network constraints of CFRLM_SP and the power network constraints with ac power flow.

Firstly, individual electric vehicle (EV) charging behaviours are modeled considering EV customers adopting smart charging services as the main charging method and those using fast charging, super fast charging and battery swapping services as a complementary charging approach. Next, EV aggregation and the associated system economic dispatch model are built. A novel model predictive control (MPC) learning approach is then proposed to iteratively learn the correlation between different types of EV charging loads and the EV interactions with renewables and other generating units in modern power grids of the future. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used to quantify the ratio of different types of charging loads in a region and strategically guide on the integration of EVs and renewables to achieve the clean energy transition goals. The proposed framework can also be used to decide charging capacity needs in a charging demand zone.

In addition, the requirement of a low-carbon smart grid means some policy backgrounds, such as carbon emissions trading (CET), should not be ignored. Under these circumstances, it is a good idea to construct a novel unit commitment (UC) model. This paper proposes a model that not only takes advantage of various resources on the demand side, such as electric vehicles, demand response, and distributed generation, but also reflects the effects of CET on generation schedule. Then, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is applied to solve the problem. In numerical studies, we analyze the impacts of DSR and CET on the results of UC, respectively. In addition, two meaningful experiments are conducted to study the approaches to allocate emission quotas and the effects of price transmission mechanism.

PEVFCSs are supplied by the DNs, generally using power electronic devices. Thus, PEVFCSs could be used as power line conditioners, especially as active filters (for mitigating harmonic pollutions) and reactive power compensators. Accordingly, this paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model taking into account the traffic impacts and power line conditioning capabilities of PEVFCSs to determine optimal locations and sizes of PEVFCSs. Various load profile patterns and the variation of charging demand during the planning horizon are included in this model to consider different operation states of DN and TN. The proposed model is implemented in GAMS and applied to two standard test systems. Numerical results are provided for the case studies and various scenarios. The results confirm the ability and efficiency of the proposed model and its superiority to the existing models.	[Hashemian, Seyed Nasrollah; Latify, Mohammad Amin; Yousefi, G.

Scalable Electric Vehicle Charging Protocols	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS				Article								Although electric vehicles are considered a viable solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, their uncoordinated charging could have adverse effects on power system operation. Nevertheless, the task of optimal electric vehicle charging scales unfavorably with the fleet size and the number of control periods, especially when distribution grid limitations are enforced. To this end, vehicle charging is first tackled using the recently revived Frank-Wolfe method. The novel decentralized charging protocol has minimal computational requirements from vehicle controllers, enjoys provable acceleration over existing alternatives, enhances the security of the pricing mechanism against data attacks, and protects user privacy. To comply with voltage limits, a network-constrained EV charging problem is subsequently formulated. Leveraging a linearized model for unbalanced distribution grids, the goal is to minimize the power supply cost while respecting critical voltage regulation and substation capacity limitations. Optimizing variables across grid nodes is accomplished by exchanging information only between neighboring buses via the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical tests corroborate the optimality and efficiency of the novel schemes.

As a high-quality FR resource, community integrated energy station (CIES) can effectively respond to frequency deviation caused by renewable energy generation, helping to solve the frequency problem of power system. This paper proposes an optimal planning model of CIES considering FR service. First, the model of FR service is established to unify the time scale of FR service and economic operation. Then, an optimal planning model of CIES considering FR service is proposed, with which the revenue of participating in the FR service is obtained under market mechanism. The flexible electricity pricing model is introduced to flatten the peak tie-line power of CIES. Case studies are conducted to analyze the annual cost and the revenue of CIES participating in FR service, which suggest that providing ancillary services can bring potential revenue.

As EV adoption grows, charging demand-particularly during peak hours in cities-may place significant pressure on the electrical grid. Charging at high power, especially during the evening when most EVs are parked in residential areas, can lead to grid instability and increased costs. One promising solution is to leverage long-duration, low-power charging, which can align with typical user behavior and improve grid compatibility. This paper delves into how public slow charging stations (<7.4 kW) in metropolitan residential areas can alleviate grid pressures while fostering a host of additional benefits. We show that, with respect to a reference (22 kW infrastructure), such stations can increase EV user satisfaction by up to 20%, decrease grid costs by 40% owing to a peak load reduction of 10 to 55%, and provide six times the flexibility for energy markets. Cities can overcome the limitation of private garage scarcity with this charging approach, thus fostering the transition to EVs.

The proposed model helps the investor evaluate two potential options: aggregating distributed batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) or using a dedicated energy storage system (ESS). For EV aggregations in AS markets, the targeted EV fleet size, which is a function of energy tariff charged by the EV aggregator, is a key planning consideration. In the case of ESS, the physical size is the main planning consideration. Using the proposed model, the two options for maximizing the investor's long-term payoffs are analyzed and compared by assuming the same initial investment cost for both options. Accordingly, the investor's daily bidding strategy in AS markets is optimized for each case. The net present worth is used as the basis for comparing the two investment options, and sensitivity analyses are carried out to study the impact of planning and operation variables on the feasibility of the two options. Simulation results consider both options and discuss the results for providing AS to electricity markets.

Modelling of PEVs (as vehicle to grid (V2G)) is highly dependent on the owner's behaviour. In this study, a systematic method based on multi-state Markov model is utilised to represent the uncertainty of V2G's presence. To investigate the impact of PEVs, a probabilistic TEP in the presence of V2Gs (P_TEPV2G) is proposed. In the proposed TEP model, the objective function consists of the total line and risk costs (RCs). Moreover, the optimal place and capacity of PEV parking lots are considered as the decision variables. It is assumed that there is an electric vehicle fleet operator for the management of electric vehicles. Because P_TEPV2G is a complex and non-linear optimisation problem, an improved cuckoo search algorithm (ICS) is utilised to effectively solve the problem. On the IEEE 24-bus system, simulation results show that the availability of the PEVs at the proper bus leads to decreasing RC and deferring construction of new transmission lines.

It is proposed that the system operator uses the electric vehicles (EVs) as alternative resources of primary reserve in the power system. The proposed model deals with the effect of generation scheduling on the EV charging schedules and primary reserve capacities. In fact, the amount of primary reserve provided by EVs is highly related to the EV's charging schedules. Therefore, in this paper a smart charging algorithm is also proposed that is based on direct load control of EVs by the system operator. The proposed scheme would be applicable with the lowest intelligence level and will not impose extra investment cost to the EV owners. All the nonlinear constraints included in the primary reserve scheduling are linearized to be solvable by mixed integer linear programming method. A case study on IEEE RTS79 system with 30% EV penetration is used to illustrate the feasibility and acceptable performance of the proposed method. The influence of EVs' participation on operation costs, load curve, and EV bills is discussed.

In this article, the optimal charging pricing problem of public electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) considering the interdependent operations of UTN and PDN is modeled from the view of the charging network operator (CNO), which is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. In order to match the spatial size of UTN and power capacity of PDN, multiple PDNs are incorporated in the modeling to support EVCSs at different parts of UTN, permitting charging load migration across PDNs. Fixed point theory is used to analyze properties of the CNO's optimal charging pricing problem. An iterative method is designed to obtain the optimal charging pricing result, which solves the CNO's pricing subproblem and PDN market clearing subproblem in turn. Numerical case study results validate the effectiveness of proposed models and methods, and demonstrate the impacts of the CNO pricing on the operations of UTN and PDN.

Y.; Wen, Fushuan; Qin, Mingwen; Xue, Yusheng			Scenario-Based Comprehensive Expansion Planning for Distribution Systems Considering Integration of Plug-in Electric Vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS				Article								Widespread utilization of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) would incur more uncertainties, and thus challenge the traditional planning strategies for distribution systems. In this paper, a scenario-based comprehensive expansion planning (SCEP) approach for distribution systems is presented to cope with future uncertainties. This approach can not only take into account the initial investment and operation costs but also consider the expected adaptation cost to other future scenarios, and in this way the flexibility of an initial planning scheme can be achieved. Future scenarios are identified in line with three uncertainties, namely the conventional load levels, penetration levels of PEVs and whether or not with successful implementation of a coordinated charging strategy. The charging profile for dump charging mode has been determined straightforwardly, while that for coordinated charging mode is obtained by solving the proposed day-ahead dispatching model (DDM). Furthermore, a priority-based real time dispatching strategy (PRTDS) is proposed to obtain direct charging instructions for PEVs, and thus to demonstrate the rationality of utilizing the charging profile acquired from DDM in distribution system expansion planning (DSEP). Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by numerical studies.

This paper presents the enhanced solution for the coordinated planning of multiple facilities in the two networks, including electric power lines, transportation roads, energy storage systems and fast charging stations. In order to calculate the optimal solution for the proposed coordinated planning problem, we introduce the applications of linear optimization theory including Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, the big M method, and a linear expression of power loss to transform the nonlinear planning problem into a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) formulation, which is solved by commercial solvers. The proposed MIQCP formulation is decomposed into two corresponding subproblems by Lagrangian relaxation to represent transportation and electric power networks. The case studies validate the proposed planning model and demonstrate that the proposed solution can enhance the coordinated network planning with the proliferation of EVs.

The use of EVs has been promoted through the development of inclusive strategies for electromobility in the recent years. Apart from actions directed and funded by the European Union, national strategies have also been employed to support electromobility. Such a strategic plan has already been enacted by the Hellenic Ministry of Environment and Energy, funding municipalities to prepare siting and sizing plans for electric vehicle chargers. In this paper, the final study of this strategic plan for the municipality of Heraklion in Crete is used as a case study to investigate the effect of EV chargers on the operation of the Cretan power system. Their selected siting points are evaluated by performing a power flow analysis at the level of 150 kV. Thus, they are aggregated in each 20 kV/150 kV distribution substation of the electrical grid with the aim of investigating their effect on substation loading and transmission line losses. Generally, extensive fast charging should be avoided to minimize the risk of sudden stress of the existing cities' grids and control strategies should be implemented to mitigate the need for upscale substation equipment or even postpone reinforcements.

Whilst this burden is borne by the distribution system operator (DSO), microgrid-users can contribute in grid congestion management to maintain a stable grid connection by providing flexibility on the DSO's request. This paper uses Jacobi-alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize power exchange between a microgrid and the grid to assist in congestion management. The algorithm decomposes the optimization problem into sub-problems solved locally and in parallel using fitted Q-iteration. The local optimization plans the operation of heat pumps and batteries to provide the required flexibility. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using real-world data from thirty residential prosumers. Simulation results show that solving the sub-problems with fitted Q-iteration leads to feasible control policies within acceptable computation times while providing the required flexibility for grid congestion management.

By analyzing the influence of various information declared by electric vehicle users on the dispatching plan made by aggregators, and by taking the declared dispatching power, users' credit, battery loss and users' participation as evaluation indicators, the evaluation index model of electric vehicle cluster is established. The weight of each index is determined based on the optimal combination weight method of accelerated genetic algorithm. At the same time, this paper compares and analyzes various scenarios under different weights to obtain the scheduling order of each electric vehicle in the cluster. Combined with the requirements of power system scheduling plan, this paper further determines the schedulable ability of each aggregator in each period. The example simulation shows that the comprehensive weights adopted in this paper not only can exclude the fleets with poor credit, but can also eliminate the fleets with low declared power. The proposed strategy can reasonably and effectively dispatch electric vehicle cluster to participate in the scheduling plan by comprehensively considering the influence of multiple indicators.

J	Louie, HM				Louie, Henry M.			Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Analysis of Aggregated Electric Vehicle Charging Station Load	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS				Article								The number of electric vehicles is increasing worldwide. The charging of a single electric vehicle can draw several kilowatts of power, and the aggregate effects of charging thousands of electric vehicles on electric power system infrastructure, operation, and planning must be considered. An important tool in studying the integration of electric vehicles and developing associated technologies and controls within the framework of the smart grid are probabilistic models of charging station load. This article identifies, evaluates, and proposes probabilistic models and analyzes the statistical characteristics of aggregated electric vehicle charging station load. A data-driven approach is taken, using measured time-stamped power consumption from charging stations to formulate and evaluate suitable parametric probabilistic models. The influence of time-of-use pricing on electric vehicle charging station load characteristics is also examined. Two data setsone from Washington State, the other from San Diego, CAeach covering over 2 years, are used to create the models.

With the continuous increase of the temperature-controlled load and the proportion of electric vehicle load in the urban power grid, the complexity of the load side in the restoration process gradually increases. Therefore, based on the existing grid environment, this paper considers the sudden increase in load recovery caused by cold load pick-up and the auxiliary effect of electric vehicle discharge on load recovery during the load recovery process. From the perspective of economy, safety, and speed, this paper establishes a multi-objective function that includes the amount of load, improved weighted power flow entropy, and the number of recovered lines. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition is used to optimize the constructed multi-objective load recovery model. Through the IEEE30 node system, it is verified that the method proposed in this paper can effectively establish a fast and safe load recovery plan that meets the actual grid environment.

However, DR programs must consider the increasing demand-side uncertainty due to proliferative devices like electric vehicles and rooftop photovoltaics. Shifting power consumption by DR programs may change the realizations of future uncertainties of loads, leading to decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs). This paper first proposes a novel multi-stage robust energy and reserve dispatch model with the DR program, where DDUs of deferrable loads and decision-independent uncertainties (DIUs) of curtailable loads are considered simultaneously. Then we develop an improved constraint generation (CG) algorithm with an embedded scenario mapping approach to solve the model effectively. Numerical experiments illustrate the influence of DDUs on the multi-stage robust dispatch problem and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method to cope with DDUs and DIUs in DR programs.

Traditionally, to compare their efficiency, one energetic model is developed per architecture and is optimized. Today, this heuristic approach can be replaced by a systematic method that explores all the possibilities in a defined search space. This article presents hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) optimization and comparison using an automatic methodology for architecture generation. The components of the series-parallel hybrid architecture, with the exception of planetary gears, are chosen as starting components. All possible architectures are generated and then filtered to determine the most promising ones. The latter are automatically assessed and optimized using a general hybrid model. The process includes a genetic algorithm (GA) for design optimization and dynamic programming (DP) for control optimization. Given two different objectives to minimize, namely, battery size and fuel consumption in our considered case, the Pareto fronts of the most promising architectures are presented and compared to the Pareto fronts of reference series-parallel architectures. Several of the filtered architectures are found to be better than the references (their consumption is roughly 5 & percnt; lower), and a gain in powertrain sizing and cost is found. The best architecture is explored, and its operation is analyzed to determine the functionalities that lead to its energy efficiency.

Vehicle -to -Building (V2B) and Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are two important and effective tools. However, existing studies lack the sizing method of bidirectional chargers and ESSs. This study has proposed a costeffective sizing method of V2B chargers and ESSs during the planning stage. By developing a linear model that clusters electric vehicle users based on mobility patterns and employing mixed integer linear programming for day -ahead control strategies, the method minimizes the dynamic payback period of initial investments. Tested in an office park featuring photovoltaic generation, the optimal configuration of 50% V2B chargers and 1 ESS significantly reduces cumulative peak -hour load and peak power by 51.3% and 42.4%, respectively. The price and rated power of EV chargers on the optimal sizing result are also investigated, providing guidance for the design and operation of micro -grid systems. Furthermore, the study suggests further exploration into actual data acquisition, real-time control strategy enhancement, and comprehensive user behavior for broader application.

This means with smart charging it is possible to shift loads from peak to off-peak hours. For the flexibility from privately owned electric vehicles to be offered to the electricity market, customer participation is crucial; however, the impacts of sub-aggregation on customers have not been studied thoroughly. In this paper, charging data covering over 80,000 real-world charging sessions from various commercial charging sites are introduced and the charging characteristics are analyzed. Importantly, a method for finding an optimal pattern for load reduction with the least impact on customers is presented. We suggest an optimal schedule for load reduction from the customer viewpoint at different types of charging sites, including public car parks, offices, residential sites, and shopping centers. The findings indicate that residential and office charging sites offer the greatest potential for load reduction with the least impact on customers. The most flexibility is available during peak charging hours, which on average are at 08:00 at car parks, 07:30 at office sites, 19:00 at residential sites, and 10:00 at shopping centers.

A fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV) with the FC/battery hybrid powertrain is used as the study case. The battery plays a key role in current transportation electrification, and the optimal sizing of the battery is critical for both system technical performances and economical revenues, especially in the hybrid design. The optimal battery design should coordinate the static sizing study against the dynamic power distribution for a given system, but few works provided the synergistic consideration of the two parts. In this study, the interaction happens in each sizing point with the optimal power sharing between the battery and the FC, aiming at minimizing the summation of hydrogen consumption, FC degradation, and battery degradation. Under the proposed framework, the power management is developed with deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, considering multiobjectives that minimize hydrogen consumption and suppress system degradation. In the case study, optimal sizing parameters with lowest cost are determined. Leveraged by the optimal size, the hybrid system economy with synergistic approach is improved by 16.0%, compared with the conventional FC configuration.

Therefore, a capacity planning method is proposed from the perspective of reliability evaluation and economic analysis. Firstly, an EVs model with load characteristics is developed. Then, the reliability evaluation process and economic model are presented. Finally, the capacity planning schemes are compared and selected in the modified RBTS BUS6 F4 system. The results show that the probability indices will be optimized by increasing RE capacity with a certain energy storage system (ESS) configuration, but the system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI) shows non-monotonic change. Taking Microgrid A as an example, the peak of SAIFI can be reduced by 63.17 % when ESS configuration change from 1.0 MW & sdot;h/0.1 MW to 3.0 MW & sdot;h/1.5 MW, which indicates that reasonable ESS configuration can effectively reduce the impact of SAIFI on microgrid.

Reliability and allocation of charging systems (charging stations and piles) need strong support from the distribution network, whose expansion planning would be also greatly impacted by the incremental load from the charging system. To address this issue, a collaborative planning scheme of the EV charging system and distribution networks that combines economic and reliability benefits is proposed, which is formulated as a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model considering source-load uncertainties. First, a candidate EVCS planning scheme is obtained using queuing theory. Then, system reliability is quantified by adopting the average energy not supplied index and correlated integrated into the two-stage mixed-integer linear programming model. Finally, it is solved to perform distributionally robust expansion planning by the column and constraint generation algorithm. Effectiveness and scalability of the proposed planning method are illustrated by numerical case studies. Results indicate the planning scheme that considers economic and reliability benefit can perform better than traditional optimization methods.

Due to the increase in Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) penetration, the power system's resilience can be increased by scheduling PEV charging and discharging in electrified Parking Lots (PLs); So this paper presents a bi-level optimization model that considers the electrical and transportation networks simultaneously. The Upper-Level (UL) problem specifies the optimal DN islanding plan to maximize the amount of load restored utilizing the optimal charge/discharge management of PEVs in PLs. The closest energized PL to the deenergized destination PLs and the number of PEVs in energized PLs are specified in the Lower-Level (LL) problem. The proposed bi-level framework is converted into a single-level model utilizing the Karush-KuhnTucker optimality constraints due to the linearity of the LL problem. The efficiency of the proposed framework is verified using GAMS software applying the IEEE-33 bus distribution system, and the 25-node traffic network. Analysis of the simulation results shows that the optimal islanding decision considering the PEV drivers' willingness to stop in energized PLs and optimal charge and discharge management of these PEVs enhances the resilience of the DN.

This paper discusses the architecture and control framework of the proposed CPEMS. Acapacity optimization problem is formulated based on the mixed-integer linear programming and solved with a scenario-based approach to schedule the CPEMS generation and storage. Individual nanogrids and BSS share scheduled generation and storage resources and exploit diversities in supply and demand profiles to achieve mutual economic and security benefits. The paper considers the following three issues: 1) optimal sizing and scheduling of nanogrids and BSS can supply a sufficient storage capacity for smoothing out volatile renewable energy sources ( RES); 2) surplus RES generation can be aggregated and stored in the BSS for supplying electric vehicles at peak hours; and 3) a networked nanogrid structure can share BSS resources for attaining considerable savings and higher resilience, without compromising each nanogrid's cyber-physical security. Numerical case studies demonstrate the applications of the proposed CPEMS to power system operation and control.

Especially, the resilience aspect of the EVs is focused due to its significance for EVs during power outages. First, the stochastic load of the fast-charging station (FCS) and the resilience load of the EVs are estimated using probability distribution functions. This information is utilized to maintain the energy level in the ESS to ensure the resilience of EVs during power outages. Then, the annualized cost of the ESS is determined using the annual interest rate and lifetime of ESS components. Finally, the optimal ESS size is determined using the annualized ESS cost, penalty cost for buying power during peak hours, and penalty cost for resilience violations. Simulations along with sensitivity analysis of uncertainties (market price, arrival time of EVs, and the residual energy level of EVs), number of EVs in the FCS, and converter ratings are conducted. Simulation results have shown that increasing the penalty cost for peak intervals is a viable solution to decrease the peak load while controlling the cost of the FCS.

A prediction model for the ET spatio-temporal charging load is proposed, which considers the drivers' subjective decision-making and the ET travel patterns. First, an improved Gaussian mixture model with a genetic algorithm is developed based on the real ET data. Besides, a prospect theory based on the Dijkstra algorithm for choosing charging stations is put forward. Then, considering the ambient temperature, a calculation method for the remaining energy in the ET battery is utilized. Based on the refined travel patterns and the Monte Carlo method, the charging load in three scenarios are analyzed, which studies the influence of temperature. ET charging loads of different scales are obtained and the influence of charging load on the typical daily load profile is discussed. The simulation results show that the prediction models can combine the drivers' psychology with the objective traveling time, and the average error between the real load and the predicted load is less than 1%.

The proposed methodology allows the selection of type, capacity, and location of battery energy storage systems in distribution networks with distributed generation and electric vehicle charging stations. A mixed-integer stochastic programming problem is cunningly approached with a metaheuristic, where fitness calculation with stochastic scenarios is performed by introducing an approximation to the operation costs in the form of a polynomial neural network, generated according to the Group Method of Data Handling-GMDH method, with strong computing speeding-up. The quality of this approximation for heavy Monte Carlo simulations is assessed in a first case study using a 33-bus distribution test system. The optimization planning model is then validated in the same test system using real data collected from solar and wind sources, demand, prices, and charging stations. Four types of batteries are compared considering degradation impact. The results demonstrate the practicality and advantages of this process.

As a smart load, EV requires an intelligently designed scheduling and pricing algorithm that takes into account the stochastic EVs user behavior, grid charging capacity, battery characteristics, and real-time electricity price variations. In this paper, a multi-objective comprehensive stand-alone solution is proposed considering the time-of-use (TOU) price to intelligently regulate EVs charging/discharging activities. The proposed alternative heuristic charging strategy optimally configures solution indices and provide a tradeoff between considered evaluation parameters, thus mitigating the effect of uncontrolled charging introduced by stochastic EV charge/discharge activities. The objective is to shift the peak hours load to nonpeak hours with reduction in average-to-peak ratio, charging cost minimization and maximize the availability of charging capacity for pledging the traveling plan determined by EV users. Different EVs penetration are tested to validate the performance of the proposed solution under massive EV integration, with a driving pattern obtained from the Beijing National Travel Survey.

Modelling Electric Vehicle Charge Demand: Implementation for the Greek Power System	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								The emerging popularity of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) is creating new connections between the transportation and electric sectors, and PEV charging will bring new opportunities and challenges to a system of growing complexity. The electrification of transport will increase energy security, reduce carbon emissions, and improve local air quality. The actual expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) will depend on several factors: the evolution of autonomy, the acquisition price, the charging process and infrastructure, etc. This paper provides a guide for simulating the accumulative load profile for EV charging on a national level. The importance of all the parameters and variables involved (deterministic or stochastic) is investigated. Detailed tables and references concerning the distribution of values and the composition of the EV fleet are provided. A multivariate probabilistic model is developed considering the EV classes, weekly and seasonal driving patterns, charging strategies, battery capacities, consumption per EV, etc., leading to an accurate estimation of aggregated EV charging demand. Finally, a net-metering scheme is proposed, in which a photovoltaic (PV) system of a certain size will be able to provide the annual energy needs of the first 10,000 EVs in the Greek market.

This will result in more reliability stress and security constraints on existing and planned electricity generation and transmission assets, at a time utilities are facing pressure to do more with less. This paper proposes to address grid limitations, which may constrain large-scale PEV integration in future grids, using a novel planning model for transmission and generation expansions under uncertainties, based on adaptive robust optimization via scenario-based ambiguity sets. The new model can achieve decarbonization of both the electricity and transportation sectors economically, while meeting the electric grid reliability requirements. It also incorporates PEV charging controls over the planning horizon aiming at facilitating the maximum PEV penetration in the used test cases, more economically and realistically, considering current technology trends. Successful applications of the proposed model on a 118 bus test system and the simplified Ontario's transmission grid demonstrate, in a satisfactory manner, its capability and effectiveness for planning deep decarbonization technology paths.

Indeed, detailed treatment of PEV charging is necessary for efficient allocation of resources. It is envisaged that a coordinator of charging schedules, i.e., a PEV aggregator, could exercise some form of load control according to electricity market prices and network charges. In this context, it is important to consider the effects of uncertainty of key input parameters to optimization algorithms for PEV charging schedules. However, the modeling of the PEV aggregator's exposure to profit volatility has received less attention in detail. Hence, this paper develops a methodology to maximize PEV aggregator profits taking decisions in day-ahead and balancing markets while considering risk aversion. Under uncertain market prices and fleet mobility, the proposed two-stage linear stochastic program finds optimal PEV charging schedules at the vehicle level. A case study highlights the effects of including the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) term in the objective function and calculates two metrics referred to as the expected value of aggregation and flexibility.

Probabilistic planning of electric vehicles charging stations in an integrated electricity-transport system	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								One of the most important aspects of the development of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the optimal sizing and allocation of charging stations. Due to the interactions between the electricity and transportation systems, the key features of these systems (such as traffic network characteristics, charging demands and power system constraints) should be taken into account for the optimal planning. This paper addressed the optimal sizing and allocation of the fast-charging stations in a distribution network. The traffic flow of EVs is modeled using the User Equilibrium-based Traffic Assignment Model (UETAM). Moreover, a stochastic framework is developed based on the Queuing Theory (QT) to model the load levels (EVs' charging demand). The objective function of the problem is to minimize the annual investment cost, as well as the energy losses that are optimized through chance-constrained programming. The probabilistic aspects of the proposed problem are modeled by using the point estimation method and Gram-Charlier expansion. Furthermore, the probabilistic dominance criteria are employed in order to compare the uncertain alternatives.

Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) should be connected to the power grid for battery charging. With a wide range of cars, the power system performance in the distribution network. The uncontrolled charging of the battery can cause issues such as overvoltage, overload, unbalanced load, instability, harmonics, and increased loss. Hence, efficient charging methodologies need to be developed for the power grid. The objective of this article is to maximize the total revenue of the charging stations and schedule the charging stations for PEV charging with reduced cost. First, the system model with its objectives such as demand, constraints, and fitness values are computed. Next, efficient charging path planning is proposed using the deep Q network, which is a reinforcement learning model. This can assist the PEV user in selecting the charging station and planning its path. Lastly, the particle sailfish optimization from our previous research work has been used to solve the charging station optimal solution. The simulation results analysis shows the efficiency of the proposed model in reducing the charging cost and time and improves the charging scheduling of PEVs.

Motivated by nonstop power exchange design, this article proposes a novel facility planning model under energy transfer conditions and natural endowments, such as photovoltaic resources in geographical locations, to optimize the overall system benefit.

The optimal facility location and allocation of photovoltaic hydrogen plants, movable tank shifting devices, and train cars are collaboratively decided. A Lhasa-Xining railway case study is applied by conducting sensitivity analyses on significant parameters. Various insights hold the promise to promote policies and strategies for integrating transportation and power systems in a real-world application. It is demonstrated that energy cost reduction, solar power generation improvement, and energy-carrier capacity expansion help solve the mileage anxiety problem in nonstop power exchange systems.

As an intermediary between power grid and individual electric vehicle, electric vehicle aggregator can play an important role in the coordination and management of electric vehicle charging. In this paper, we develop a decentralized EV charging control strategy of the electric vehicle aggregator for scheduling the flexible charging demand of plug-in electric vehicles in residential distribution networks. First, the centralized charging control model of the electric vehicle aggregator aiming at the maximization of its revenue under the background of time of use price mechanism is established, meanwhile meeting individual charging requirements and satisfying distribution network constraints. Then a decentralized charging control strategy of the electric vehicle aggregator based on the augmented Lagrangian method and the alternating direction multiplier method is proposed. The electric vehicles can decide their charging plan locally with the decentralized strategy, which can eliminate the problem of high communication cost, low computing efficiency and privacy protection caused by the centralized charging control model in practical application.

It is predicted that the penetration of electric vehicles in the electrical network will grow steadily during the next few years. This growth of penetration causes major challenges for power system users, especially the distribution network. Firstly, increasing load consumption, especially during peak hours, and secondly, increasing the cost of developing a network to provide load, along with the operation moved away from the optimum point, are the major challenges of the penetration of electric vehicles. In this research, a solution is proposed not only to resolve these challenges but also to make an opportunity to improve the network parameters. In this study, the charging and discharging strategy along with two price-based and voltage-based load management programs are proposed to manage the penetration of electric vehicles for economic and technical purposes. The proposed plan is implemented by GAMS and MATLAB software on the distribution network, and finally, the results are evaluated.

J	Lin, JF; Qiu, J; Yang, Y; Lin, WD				Lin, Jiafeng; Qiu, Jing; Yang, Yi; Lin, Weidong			Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Considering Fuzzy Selection of Second Life Batteries	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS				Article								The increasing sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in the market poses critical questions for the public on how to deal with millions of retired batteries (RBs). A number of studies have shown that second-life batteries (SLBs) from EVs usually have a considerable remaining capacity and hence still have additional utilization value. This article proposes a novel fuzzy inference system (FIS)-based planning framework for EV charging stations with wind, PV power, battery energy storage system and the utilization of SLBs (EVCS-WPE-SLBs system). In this framework, a narrowed and the most probable candidate node set for EVCS-WPE-SLBs system which makes the trade-off of several off-site factors from different fields that jointly determine the optimal planning results is obtained, including the installation and utilization requirements of SLBs, the transportation network features and power system properties. Numerical case studies are conducted on a coupled IEEE 33-bus distribution system and 25-node transportation system. According to the simulation results, the reasonable utilization of SLBs in the EVCS-WPE-SLBs system can reduce the total system cost while maintaining the normal operation of the system. Besides, a narrowed and most probable candidate node set not only reduces the search space and simplifies the optimization problem, but the results obtained are more practical according to the actual system conditions in real life.

In contrast to the inevitability and immutability of the use of household appliances, the duration and time period of charging electric vehicles can be changed. This paper addresses the aforementioned problem by time-of-use (TOU) electricity price, which can guide residents to stagger hours to charge, achieving the objective of peak load shifting. Taking residential areas as the research scope, considering the uncertainty of EV users' homecoming time, departure time and charging demand, the article proposes a bi-level planning model for pricing electric vehicle charging. The lower level is a minimization model of charging costs for individual users, which can acquire the charging load of all vehicles for multiple days. The upper level is a robust optimization model of TOU electricity price considering uncertain factors, which obtains the fast and slow charging prices. It has been demonstrated that the model increases grid stability by 43.46%.

In order to represent the stochastic characteristics of the EV driving patterns, a chance constrained optimization of the EV charging is proposed and formulated through MIP. With the chance constraints in the optimization formulations, it guarantees that the failure probability of the EV charging plan fulfilling the driving requirement is below the predetermined confidence parameter. The efficacy of the proposed approach was demonstrated by case studies using a 33-bus distribution system of the Bornholm power system and the Danish driving data. The case study results show that the DLMP method through chance constrained MIP can successfully alleviate the congestion in the distribution network due to the EV charging while keeping the failure probability of EV charging not meeting driving needs below the predefined confidence.

ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								A considerable number of classic and modern control applications in distribution systems are developed aiming at make the most of the existing infrastructure. Under this perspective, investments postponement in grid upgrade appears as a good expectable result. The advent of smart grids enhances this expectation since it promises ubiquitous system monitoring, secure and trustworthy communication technologies and advanced control schemes. These features will allow the implementation of innovative algorithms for better operation and management of system assets. New possibilities arise for DSM, microgeneration control, electric vehicle charging and intelligent operation of energy storage devices. The scientific literature has countless examples that illustrate the benefits of such tools. A frequent outcome of these studies highlights the advantage of investments deferral in network reinforcement. This paper analyzes the combined effects of these control actions with the investments required for network upgrade, namely in lines and transformers reinforcement. Contrary to other research papers, our results demonstrate that investments deferral could lead frequently to higher costs in a long-term perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optimal Energy Management Integrating Plug in Hybrid Vehicle Under Load and Renewable Uncertainties	IEEE ACCESS				Article								This article introduces a robust optimal week-ahead generation scheduling approach that takes into account plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) considering uncertainty in loads, renewable energy resources, and PHEV charging behavior. Due to the complexity of the scheduling process there is crucial need for a reliable optimal algorithm. The proposed approach can be applied in energy management platforms of decarbonized eco-friendly power systems. Generation scheduling is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem: (a) minimize generation production cost and (b) minimize emission costs. The focal concern is to (a) handle the scheduling of renewable energy resources against their volatilities, (b) integrating PHEVs with uncertainties related to their state of charge, and (c) stochastic load behavior over a whole week. Two heuristic-based algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem, namely Water Cycle Algorithm and Gravitational Search Algorithm The proposed scheduling approach is implemented in MATLAB ? Platform, and is tested using two different microgrids sizes, 3 generator, and 10 generator unit systems integrating the effect of week days profile, renewable energy intermittency and different PHEV state of charges using the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) data. The results show promising performance of GSA over the WCA in the energy management studies integrating three different types of sources; thermal units, Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), and the PHEVs.

Optimal sizing and siting of different types of EV charging stations in a real distribution system environment	IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION				Article								Due to the rising of both economic and environmental concerns in the energy sector, each subdivision of the community is investigating new solutions to overcome this critical issue. For this reason, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained more significance in the transportation sector owing to their efficient and clean operation chance. These improvements, however, bring new challenges such as installation costs, infrastructure renovation, and loading of the existing power system. Here, optimal sizing and siting of EV charging stations (CSs) are examined in a mixed-integer linear programming framework with the aim of minimizing the number of EVCSs in the distribution system (which in turn means to minimize CS-related investment while satisfying EV owners' needs) while satisfying constraints. The proposed optimization model considers EVCS types with different charging rate capabilities to provide opportunities for demand-side management. Moreover, the model takes the actual behaviour of the battery charging pattern into account by using real measured EV charging data together with the consideration of an actual distribution system belonging to a region in Turkey. Lastly, a bunch of case studies is conducted in order to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the devised model.

Suhail			Standardized Communication Model for Home Energy Management System	IEEE ACCESS				Article								As the number of electric vehicles and PhotoVoltaic (PV) panels per household increases, the need for a coordination between these active components becomes more imminent. Home energy management systems (HEMS) have been proposed to increase efficiency, renewable energy capture and reduce costs for the owners. However, renewable energy is intermittent and time dependent. To increase the capture of this source, an integrated control with Electric Vehicle (EVs) is required to store excessive solar energy. Furthermore, coordination with the load profile enables storage for use at a later time or selling the excess energy to the grid. This requires the use of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that can coordinate all these components with the grid. Operation of these controllers need to be validated before actual deployment. In this paper, a standardized communication modeling based on IEC 61850 is developed for a HEMS controller. An integrated emulation platform using network simulator and IEC 61850 Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) emulator is set up and the operation of HEMS is demonstrated with proper message exchanges. Such validation is crucial to project's success before on-site deployment.	[Ustun, Taha Selim; Hussain, S. M.

EVs are a hopeful way to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, but the way they charge can put a lot of stress on the grid, which can cause problems for both grid operators and EV users. The uncontrolled approach to EV charging could result in the development of new peak loads. This paper formulates a problem for the minimisation of EV charging cost while reducing the load variance using a dynamic charging strategy. This dynamic charging strategy forecasts the charging price of EV for each time stamp based on the available energy generation. The proposed formulation has also considered the seasonal variation in load profile. The model is solved using different optimisation algorithm and different scenarios have been formulated to validate the effectiveness of the optimisation problem which has been formulated to achieve the objectives of minimised charging cost and load variance. The proposed strategy has improved the charging cost by 67% from other strategies of EV charging while reduction in load variance comes out to be 69%. This proposed formulation will help in the higher adoption of EV's and will subsequently lead to sustainable growth.

This paper proposes a multidisciplinary approach to jointly plan PEV charging stations and distributed photovoltaic (PV) power plants on a coupled transportation and power network. We formulate a two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the sites and sizes of: 1) PEV charging stations and 2) PV power plants. This proposed method incorporates comprehensive models of: 1) transportation networks with explicit PEV driving range constraints; 2) PEV charging stations with probabilistic quality of service constraints; 3) PV power generation with reactive power control; and 4) alternating current distribution power flow. The formulation results in a mixed-integer second-order cone program. We then design a generalized Benders decomposition algorithm to efficiently solve it. Numerical experiments show that investing in distributed PV power plants with PEV charging stations has multiple benefits, e.g., reducing social costs, promoting renewable power integration, and alleviating power congestion. The benefits become more prominent when utilizing PV generation with reactive power control, which can also help to enhance power supply quality.

However, the subjectivity and unpredictability of users' trip plans in special circumstances significantly impact the dispatching results of EV clusters. To address this issue, this paper establishes a real-time trip chain correction model that integrates power and traffic networks to simulate the distribution of EV charging loads under spatiotemporal reconfiguration. Furthermore, considering the dispatchable potential of EVs after trip completion, a user behavior decision-making method is proposed. This method utilizes fuzzy control to analyze EV charging demand and quantifies the degree of user responsiveness to the dispatching strategy. Then, based on the charging urgency index, a coordinated dispatching strategy is introduced to mitigate grid fluctuations, reduce peak loads, and lower user charging costs. Finally, experiments analyze the effects of spatiotemporal reconstruction and decision-making behavior on the EV dispatching process. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in reducing users' charging costs while achieving peak load reduction and valley filling in the power grid.

This integration requires an appropriate planning to achieve the future sustainable distribution network. Real EV charging demand is stochastic and affected by many uncertainties, which pose challenges to the planning of a charging station. This study presents a stochastic planning model of the EV charging station with photovoltaic (PV), battery and transformer, mainly considering the uncertainties from charging demand and PV power generation. Firstly, a comprehensive EV charging demand model is established through reflecting the coupling among the EV stochastic charging behaviour, charger specifications and EV charging assignment model. Then, the planning model is formulated to minimise the total cost of the charging station, where the uncertainties arising from EV charging are addressed in various constraints. Using this model, the optimal sizing of the charging station is determined, together with the associated optimal operation strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by multiple case studies.

In this context, a personalized fast-charging navigation strategy based on mutual effect of dynamic queuing is proposed. First, an effective charging navigation system is presented to enable the integration of EV information terminals, fast-charging stations (FCSs), intelligent transportation system, and information processing center (IPC). Next, by incorporating the real-time mutual effect of dynamic queuing as well as considering the priority reservation cost of the EV drivers who reserve charging priority before others, a dynamic reservation-waiting queue model is established. After that, on the basis of the above model, the coupling relations of the criteria that may affect the charging experience are investigated for the first time and the charging navigation plans in IPC are optimized for diverse EVs. Finally, the validity of the method is verified by conducting the simulation under the participation of 2250 EVs in the urban areas of a city. Results show that the proposed charging strategy will increase charging satisfaction on average by more than 10.9% in all analyzed cases.

V2G mode based on microgrid is used for multi-objective optimisation coordination between the EVs and the power grid, and a multi-objective optimisation model, in which minimum grid load fluctuation, maximum renewable energy utilisation and maximum benefits for the EV users as the optimisation objectives are established. In order to solve the optimisation model, searching valley scheduling algorithm, variable threshold optimisation algorithm and variable charge/discharge rate optimisation algorithm are proposed successively. In order to verify the control effect, the three proposed algorithms are compared with the without optimisation algorithm. The results show that the three proposed algorithms, in a manner, could improve the imbalance between power supply and demand of the microgrid; increase utilisation of renewable energy; and bring certain benefits to the EV users. By analysis of experimental data, the control effect of variable charge/discharge rate scheduling algorithm is the best in the three scheduling algorithms.

Moreover, due to the depletion of fossil fuels, it is very difficult to manage the demand requirement of the SAARC regions, which leads to significant power shortage issues. These problems would be resolved through the integration of the substantial amount of renewable energy resources (RERs) that are available in excess in the SAARC regions into the power system networks. This will provide a futuristic roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment in the SAARC region. In this regard, the SAARC region has devised a new plan to transform its smart grid infrastructure into the super smart grid (SSG), which would connect the SAARC countries using the high voltage transmission lines utilizing each country's substantial RERs. To accelerate this ecofriendly effort, the key objective of this review study is to evaluate the potential of the SAARC SSG for demand management and emissions reduction. This study provides a comprehensive overview of SSG technology, covering its technical background, management, power flow improvement techniques, power stability techniques, simulation models, and future steps for development in the SAARC region. First, the regional conflicts, energy deficiency, and potential of the SAARC region have been discussed. Second, a potential architecture of the SAARC SSG has been simulated. Third, a novel Markov chain modeling has been presented for demand management in the SAARC regions. The results and discussions section presents findings from simulations and models. The paper also discusses CO2 reduction techniques, including methods for capturing, storing, and utilizing carbon in biofuel. The study also discusses futuristic optimization techniques in SSG, including blockchain, federated learning, reinforcement learning, the metaverse, digital twin technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The SSG challenges and limitations section summarizes the challenges and limitations faced by SSG. Finally, a roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment for the SAARC power grids has been identified to support the implementation of the futuristic SAARC SSG. The results exhibited that there is a good potential for successful demand management and emissions reduction through the SAARC SSG.

Mandi			Optimal siting and sizing of renewable energy sources and charging stations simultaneously based on Differential Evolution algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								Electric Vehicles (EVs) are seen to have some negative impacts on microgrid performance, such as diminishing power quality and efficiency and increasing power losses, voltage variations and even customer energy prices. This paper proposes a new method for evaluating the effect of integrating a large number of EVs on a power system and their impact on the network voltage profile via injecting reactive power into highly-loaded buses. A multi-objective optimization problem is developed to obtain the optimal siting and sizing of charging stations and renewable energy sources (RES). The optimization problem focuses on reducing power losses, improving voltage stability of the system and reducing charging costs of EVs. In order to increase the network load factor some coefficients are introduced. Such coefficients, which depend on wind speed, solar irradiance and hourly peak demand ratio in the load characteristic of day-ahead, help aggregators to charge their EVs in off-peak hours. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is used for solving the optimization problem. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated for 69-bus and 94-bus microgrids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While existing forecasting methods have made strides, they often fall short in addressing the challenges of low spatial resolution and spatial heterogeneity. Low spatial resolution, characterized by sparse data distribution and a dearth of information between geographically diverse charging stations, coupled with spatial heterogeneity, which is evident in the fluctuating energy demand across different regions, requires a sophisticated approach. In this study, we introduce the Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (MSSTGAN), a pioneering framework that adeptly navigates these complexities. MSSTGAN employs an encoder-decoder architecture underpinned by split-pyramid attention to resolve issues of low spatial resolution, enabling the model to process multi-scale data and capture temporal dynamics effectively. Moreover, it incorporates graph attention mechanisms to manage spatial heterogeneity in energy demand, ensuring a nuanced understanding of regional variations. Our framework's efficacy is underscored by its superior performance over existing baselines on four real-world EV charging station datasets, showcasing its prowess in tackling the intricacies of low spatial resolution and spatial heterogeneity.

Fortunately, grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) present an opportunity to provide frequency services. In this paper, a two-stage frequency regulation strategy, in which EVs participate in the form of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM), is proposed. First, a frequency response (FR) model is established for both charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping stations (BSSs) using VSM control. On this basis, a two-stage strategy is proposed to consider both frequency regulation performance and system economy. Specifically, in the day-ahead stage (DAS), a multi-unit economic dispatch (ED) model is designed to formulate the operation plan; in the real-time stage (RTS), a consensus-based power allocation strategy is designed for multi-units, responsive to real-time market prices. Case studies involving real-world data of load, RES, and CS illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) decreasing frequency deviation, (ii) providing extra rotational inertia, and (iii) reducing dispatch costs.

The main problem with EVs is the requirement of charging energy, which is fed through distribution network, while simultaneously feeding already connected load. The EV's integration with the distribution network will overload the network due to EV's charging load, which will eventually trip the power system protection. In this context, it is necessary to minimize power losses, improve voltage profile with sustainable power supply network. Therefore, optimal placement of EVs is required in the distribution network. Conventionally, researchers have used DGs to minimize power losses and improve voltage profile. In this paper, authors analyzed the effect of EV's integration with simultaneous placement of distributed generations (DGs). The integration of EVs with higher penetration of DGs is cumbersome due to higher power losses and voltage variances that are outside allowable boundaries. The optimal placement of EVs into the distribution system with higher penetration of DGs is proposed in this paper using a battle royale optimization (BRO) algorithm. Since it is a new problem on CIGRE network which is not discussed before. Hence, the authors compared results with three most famous algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and accelerated PSO (APSO). The optimization problem is developed as a multi-objective function while decreasing active and reactive power losses, and minimising maximum voltage deviation index. The studied distribution network is the CIGRE 14-bus medium voltage (MV) distribution network. Three case studies are taken in which EVs are integrated in two scenarios with optimally sized and located DGs systems in the CIGRE distribution network using MATLAB. Case-1 includes simple network with DGs integration. Case-2 includes EVs only in the simple network, and case-3 finally includes EVs and DGs for optimal placement with minimum losses. The placement of the EVs results in a decrease in power losses and voltage deviation indices. The bus voltages of case-2, on the other hand, stay unchanged when the EVs are integrated. Case 3 with BRO showed the large reduction in power losses owing to the addition of EVs to the distribution network with DGs (from 19.98 kW, and 19.89 kVar to 2.54 kW, and 3.35 kVar).

Specifically, the analysis focuses on the comparison of 3 lithium-ion battery technologies (NMC, LTO and LFP) and 8 energy management strategies (including rule-based and optimization-based strategies). In order to develop this analysis, a methodology that returns the life cycle cost of each proposed case is presented. The methodology includes the optimization of the diesel generator and lithium-ion battery sizing. A scenario based on a real railway line is introduced, and the obtained results are compared to a traditional diesel-electric railway vehicle to develop a techno-economical discussion. The best lithium-ion battery technologies are found to be LTO and NMC, and the most appropriated strategy a state-machine controller optimised by a genetic algorithm approach. The best case obtains a life cycle cost reduction of the 4.0% and diesel savings of the 13.7% compared to a traditional diesel-electric railway vehicle. The proposed analysis is claimed to be potentially helpful for the cost-optimal design and operation definition of powertrains for hybrid railway vehicles.

However, a new challenge arises in sizing grid-connected LVDC systems, which is to fully utilize distributed renewable energy, energy storage, and load demand response to minimize both the economy and carbon emissions. To address this gap, this paper studies the sizing of grid-connected LVDC systems, considering the grid-connected converter, photovoltaic (PV), battery, and demand response of electric vehicles (EVs). Firstly, two objective functions are proposed, including the economy and carbon emissions. Secondly, constraints for sizing and operation are presented, with particular consideration given to the discharging of EVs and the corresponding cost of cycle-life loss. Finally, a minimum fuzzy carbon emission method (MFCEM) is proposed to solve the model, which can adaptively and objectively transform the multi-objective into a single objective. According to the case study, the proposed model comprehensively considers the cost and carbon emissions of grid-connected LVDC systems, and its feasibility and validity are verified. Compared with the linear weighting method, MFCEM is a useful method for finding a point on the Pareto front that balances cost and carbon emissions.

The UC will be mainly involved in braking and traction modes. The role of the resistor is to protect the dc bus and the battery according to the voltage and current constraints. The sizing of the elements takes into consideration the extreme braking conditions of the vehicle while respecting the Economic Commission for Europe Regulation No. 13 Harmonized. Controllers are being used in order to regulate the various electrical variables of the overall system. A sequential logic controller is also being introduced. The role of the sequential logic controller is to activate the different existing regulation controllers and to ensure the switching between the storage elements depending on the system states.

In this paper, a method is presented that sizes the stationary energy storage based on an acceptable average waiting time of drivers arriving at a fast-charging station. The novelty of this paper is the focus on the relationship between the size of stationary energy store and the user waiting time. This relationship is often ignored; however, it is critical to obtain the optimum capacity of stationary energy store. An example charging station location is chosen where there are currently eight chargers capable of 120-kW charging and a 500-kW grid connection. It is demonstrated that the method can be used at this location to design a charging station with stationary energy storage to support future 400-kW charging without upgrading the current grid connection infrastructure. With future charging, using a stationary energy storage with a capacity of 1000 kWh reduces the maximum grid power from 1800 to 500 kW.

The coupling with renewable energy production according to an optimised model of energy management within an urban microgrid responds to tomorrow's challenges of networks and smart cities. This study aims to define an intelligent infrastructure dedicated to the recharge of EVs (IIREVs) in an urban area as a charging station empowered by photovoltaic (PV)-based microgrid. This system can facilitate interactions between the IIREVs, the public power distribution network, the users of EVs, and the surrounding building. The study provides key elements to encourage the stakeholders to develop IIREVs within societal expectations, urban planning, and in adequacy with the sustainable development goals. In addition, the study highlights multidisciplinary research position that demonstrates the need of a systemic approach to remain centred on users demand and needs, to asses efficiency at various scales of IIREVs, associated services, and power grid.

This paper presents a grid-connected solar-wind hybrid system to supply the electrical load demand of a small shopping complex located in a university campus in India. Further., an EV charging station is incorporated in the system. Economic analysis is performed for the proposed setup to satisfy the charging demand of EVs as well as the electrical load demand of the shopping complex. The proposed system is designed by considering the cost of the purchased energy, which is sold to the utility grid, while the power exchange is ensured between the utility grid and other components of the system. The sizing of the component is performed to obtain the least levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) while minimizing the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) by using recent optimization techniques. The results demonstrate that the LCOE and LPSP for the proposed system are measured at 0.038 $/kWh and 0.19% with a renewable fraction of 0.87, respectively. It is determined that a cost-effective and reliable system can be designed by the proper management of renewable power generation and load demands. The proposed system may be helpful in reducing the reliance on the over-burdened grid, particularly in developing countries.

In this study, an optimization algorithm based on mixed integer linear programming is used to evaluate the economic and technical benefits of EVs when they are used as mobile energy storage systems by system operators, which is called the concept of "Vehicle for Grid"(VfG). It is particularly aimed to alleviate the load demand on grid during the peak energy periods. The results obtained for two types of EVs with different characteristics show that the economic and operational benefits can be maximized when the optimum number and specification of EVs to be integrated into the system are determined. In the best-case scenario in which 15 EVs each with a capacity of 200 kWh are used, the peak-to-average power ratio of the load curve decreases by 6.56%(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the complementarity of power flows amongst AC/DC lines is hardly described and embedded in existing configuration optimization methods in which only the average loading or the variations of loading for a certain period is considered. Solution space will be geometrically increased if operation scenarios are fully simulated for configuration caused by the strong uncertainties of DGs and EVC loads. This paper proposes an analytic quantifiable method to describe the power complementarity between AC/DC lines. The Gaussian mixture model is used to depict the temporal correlation and uncertainties. The complementarity is calculated by the conditional probability of multi-dimensional joint probability density function of AC/DC hybrid lines. Accordingly, an optimal configuration method of hybrid AC/DC distribution network is proposed considering the complementarity of power flows on AC/DC lines, in which the size and location of Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) are optimized. Simulations studies are performed to verify the proposed method.

DC distribution networks can increase the accommodation of PVs and EVs and mitigate mutilple power quality problems by the flexible power regulation capability of voltage source converters. This paper proposes schemes to establish hybrid AC/DC LVDNs considering the conversion of the existing three-phase four-wire low-voltage AC systems to DC operation. The characteristics and DC conversion constraints of typical LVDNs are analyzed. In addition, converter configurations for typical LVDNs are proposed based on the three-phase four-wire characteristics and quantitative analysis of various DC configurations. Moreover, an optimal planning method of hybrid AC/DC LVDNs is proposed, which is modeled as a bi-level programming model considering the annual investments and three-phase unbalance. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimal planning method. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal planning method can increase the integration of PVs while simultaneously reducing issues related to voltage violation and unbalance.

Considering the uncertain driving pattern of EVs, they are dynamic consumers of electricity and their integration can give rise to operational problems and jeopardize the security of the power system. Under such circumstances, the implementation of demand-side response (DSR) programs is more likely to be an effective solution for reducing the risks of load curtailment or security problems. This study proposes a voltage stability constrained DSR-coordinated planning model for increasing the penetration level of EVs in a distribution system consisting of photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs) and responsive loads. The uncertainties of PV/WT generation, the driving pattern of EVs, and load demand are modeled by an improved form of information gap decision theory (IGDT), hereafter called weighted IGDT (WIGDT). Due to the fact that the proposed model is nonlinear and non-convex, a linearization technique is adopted and the proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), solved using the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software. The standard 33-bus distribution test system and a realworld smart distribution network, based in the Isle of Wight in the UK, are used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Covering a parking lot with photovoltaic (PV) panels can keep the PEVs cool, charge their batteries for free, and generate extra energy and deliver it to the grid. Moreover, the inverter installed in the charging station of a parking lot is capable of generating or absorbing reactive power by changing the operating mode of the inverter without any degradation of the PEV's battery. Therefore, the PEVs and the solar parking lots can be applied as the auxiliary sources of active and reactive powers by the local distribution company (DISCO). In this study, in order to achieve realistic results, the economic aspects and technical factors of the system, and also the behavioural model of the PEVs fleet are taken into consideration in the planning problem. Moreover, the stochastic nature of the PEVs behaviour and power of the installed PV panels are modelled in the problem. Herein, the planning problem is solved applying quantum annealing (QA).

To prevent unexpected failure of DGs and avoid deterioration of the grid's reliability, coordination of maintenance scheduling is indispensable. In this study, maintenance management of a VPP is proposed for scheduling the planned outage of DGs, in order to preserve their useful lifespan. In addition to conventional DGs and the upstream power grid, renewable generation including wind turbines and photovoltaic systems, energy storage systems, and curtailable loads are considered as components of the VPP. The proposed maintenance scheduling scheme provides different advantages in viewpoints of cost and reliability. Moreover, risk management is also investigated to lower the risk of maintenance scheduling due to the uncertainty in price in an energy market by adopting the conditional value at risk as a measure of risk. The overall cost is minimised considering the power loss in the grid as well as the security constraints such as DGs operational constraints, voltage magnitude, and transmission lines' power flow limit. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated using numerical studies with short- and long-term scheduling.

In this perspective, this paper proposes a novel intelligent RMPS allocation method to support MGs during scheduled islanded operation. In this mode, the isolated operation of a MG is beforehand planned to mitigate the effects caused by possible predictable contingencies, e.g. weather-related events, as well as programmed maintenance. For this, first a novel energy management strategy (EMS) based on dynamic programming specifically designed for MG scheduled islanded operation is proposed. Next, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method modified to ensure a continuous search space in the face of discrete load shedding policies is developed to determine the adequate allocation of RMPS. The proposed method is simulated considering different scenarios for a MG system considering local distributed generation capacity, electric vehicles penetration, load shedding based on priority groups, as well as technical and operational limits. The obtained results showcase the proposed approach ability to meaningfully improve MG service capacity during scheduled islanded operation.

The model determines the optimal EV fleet size for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services during disaster scenarios, improving grid flexibility and providing ancillary services. It enables V2G aggregators to balance fleet availability with grid demands, ensuring efficient allocation of energy resources during crises. The study also explores monitoring the state of charge (SOC) to maintain sufficient battery levels for users' trips. The study quantifies the total cost using EVs for frequency regulation, accounting for electricity and battery degradation costs. In addition, optimizes power flow within the network, which is vital for power utilities to maintain system reliability under adverse conditions. A proactive network interdiction strategy is incorporated to mitigate cyberattacks on the power network. The combined impact of generator losses and infected nodes on critical infrastructure is also analyzed. The effectiveness of the model is benchmarked through four case studies. It successfully eliminated load shedding while tackling operational and cybersecurity challenges. Under the proposed model, the total vehicle count has decreased by up to 14.7% compared to the other cases.

J	Zhang, HR; Qiu, J; Wang, YQ				Zhang, Hengrong; Qiu, Jing; Wang, Yunqi			Planning strategy of fast-charging stations in coupled transportation and distribution systems considering human health impact	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The proliferation of the electric vehicles field brings attention to fast-charging station planning. Recently, some studies found electric vehicles that receive fast-charging service may also bring much air pollution due to fossilfuel fired power generation. Hence, depending on the power generation mix, electric vehicles may have adverse environmental impacts. The current studies of fast-charging station planning only focus on power system planning and often ignore other parts of the transportation system such as internal combustion engine vehicles and gasoline stations. Moreover, most the current studies lack a comprehensive planning strategy for the fastcharging station that involves elements above simultaneously. In this context, an interdisciplinary study is implemented on the coordinated planning strategy of the fast-charging station in coupled transportation and power distribution systems. The proposed strategy with a multiple objective integer model can measure the impact of air pollutions from electric vehicles on air quality and human health in different areas. Considering the traffic flow assignment, the driving range logic constraints are used. The branch flow model is applied to power distribution systems. To measure the impacts of air pollutions on air quality and human health, the air pollution from the Road traffic model, the Gaussian Plum Model and the C-R function are adopted. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the proposed strategy and the mathematical model. The fast-charging station location and size can be determined by the mathematical model. The transition of gasoline station to fastcharging station is suggested according to the model as well.

From these, we generate travel and plug-in behaviors by using a Monte Carlo approach to derive CFs. By varying the EV battery size, the rated charging power, and the plug-in behavior, their influence on the CF is examined. The key results show that the CF decreases to less than 25% when considering more than 50 EVs with a charging level of 11 kW, with the CF strongly depending on the number of EVs considered. By contrast, the driving behavior and the battery size have a minor influence on the CF. Furthermore, when mixing the parameters, such as EV battery size and rated charging power, then, especially, the active power drawn by the feeder does not change linearly. Ultimately, the study aims to add to the state-of-the-art by solely and systematically focusing on the CF and its sensitivity to a number of key factors. For planning and design, distribution system operators may use this study as a part of their planning for the integration of electric vehicles in the electrical grid.

J	Farid, AM				Farid, Amro M.			A Hybrid Dynamic System Model for Multimodal Transportation Electrification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY				Article								In recent years, transportation electrification has emerged as a trend to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. The true success, however, of this trend depends on the successful integration of electric transportation modes into the infrastructure systems that support them. Left unmanaged, plug-in electric vehicles may suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads on the electrical grid. Online electric vehicles have emerged to remediate the need for stationary charging and its effects. While many works have sought to mitigate these effects with advanced control functionality, such as coordinated charging, vehicle-to-grid stabilization, and charging queue management, few works have assessed these impacts as a holistic transportation-electricity nexus. This paper develops a hybrid dynamic system model for transportation electrification. It also includes next generation traffic simulation concepts of multimodality and multiagency. Such a model can be used by electrified transportation fleet operators to not just assess but also improve their operations and control. The hybrid dynamic system model is composed of a marked Petri-net model superimposed on the continuous time kinematic and electrical state evolution. The model is demonstrated on an illustrative example of moderate size and functional heterogeneity.

This study presents a novel methodology to strategically place electric vehicle aggregators along a feeder. This approach considers electrical variables and the dynamics of cloud movements within the study area. This innovative methodology reduces the substation's power load demand and significantly improves the end user's voltage levels. The improvements in voltage regulation and reduced demand on the substation provide clear benefits, including increased system resilience, better integration of renewable energy sources, and enhanced overall efficiency of the electric grid. These advantages are particularly critical in regions with high levels of photovoltaic generation and are important in promoting sustainable electric vehicle charging infrastructure. When analyzing different load scenarios for the IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder system, the consideration of distributed aggregators based on cloud movements decreased the power required at the substation by 21.25%, and the voltage drop in loads was reduced from 6.9% to 4.29%. This research underscores the critical need to consider both the variability and geographical distribution of PV resources in the planning and operation of electrical systems with extensive PV generation.

Implementation strategies in the use of energy efficiency can be made by utilizing more energy-efficient equipment or increasing penetration rate of production of new sources of energy at the generating side. These new sources of energy can be renewable sources, especially wind resource and energy storage instruments such as grid-connected electric vehicles. The vehicles can be charged during the low load and discharged during peak load. In this study, wind resources and grid-connected electric vehicles are considered as an approach for energy efficiency strategies in generation expansion planning. But, because of high investment cost, great uncertainty of wind resources' productivity and uncertainty of their supportive policies no one will invest on them without proper supportive policies in a competitive environment. So support policies for wind resource are also considered. One of the fundamental problems of supportive policies is financial support in a competitive environment. Therefore, as an innovation of the paper, grid-connected electric vehicles is used to solve the problem. In the paper, the impact of these vehicles is considered in a way that they act integrated with wind resources and thus increases the capacity factor of wind resources. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the literature review shows that a research gap exists regarding a clustering-based method to optimize the allocation of DGs and EVCSs, considering the system uncertainties. This article tries to fill such a knowledge gap by proposing a new clustering-based method to optimize the allocation of DGs and EVs simultaneously, considering the uncertainties of EV behaviours and stochastic behaviours of renewable DGs. Developing a new stochastic model for EVs using the clustering algorithm is one of the essential contributions. The uncertain parameters, e.g. EV charging loads based on EV owners' behaviours (arrival time, departure time, and driving distance) and renewable DGs, would be clustered. The proposed method could solve the execution time challenges of Monte Carlo simulation-based approaches to concern the stochastic behaviours of smart grids. The simultaneously reliability-oriented optimal allocation of EVCSs, DGs, and protection equipment, using the proposed clustering-based algorithm is another main contribution. The IEEE 33-bus test system is studied to examine the introduced method. Simulation results imply that a 1.45% accuracy improvement could be obtained compared to available analytical ones, while its execution time is appropriate. The allocation of renewable/non-renewable distributed generations and electric vehicle charging stations are optimized. Considering system uncertainties by clustering algorithms is the main novelty of this research. image	[Yaghoubi-Nia, Mohammad-Reza; Hashemi-Dezaki, Hamed; Niasar, Abolfazl Halvaei] Univ Kashan, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 6 Km Ghotbravandi Blvd, Kashan 8731753153, Iran		Hashemi-Dezaki, H (corresponding author), Univ Kashan, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 6 Km Ghotbravandi Blvd, Kashan 8731753153, Iran.	hamed.hashemi@kashanu.ac.ir								5	5											AUG	2024	18	11					1798	1818		10.1049/rpg2.13038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/rpg2.13038		JUL 2024										2025-12-09	
J	Li, Q; Zhao, N				Li, Quan; Zhao, Nan			A probability box representation method for power flow analysis considering both interval and probabilistic uncertainties	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								In the modern power system, the uncertainties such as renewable generation and electric vehicles are usually modelled as either interval or probabilistic variables for the power flow analysis. It is meaningful to study the mixed impacts of the interval and probabilistic variables on the power flow, but the existing methods considering the mixed impacts lack accuracy. This paper proposes a novel power flow analysis method considering both interval and probabilistic uncertainties, in which the probability box (P-box) model is established to investigate the power flow influenced by multi-type uncertainties. A probability-interval sample classification method combined with interpolation is proposed to achieve an accurate P-box representation of the power flow. Also, the correlation of uncertainties is fully considered where a novel extended optimizing-scenario method is proposed for obtaining the P-box model considering the multi-dimensional correlation of interval variables. Three test cases are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The P-box represented results clearly reflect the fluctuation range and the corresponding probability of the power flow. The specific influences of the sample size, correlation, capacity of multi-type uncertainties on the power flow and the P-box model are also determined and summarized.

The proposed formulation captures flexibility dynamics in integrated energy systems in long horizons with large temporal resolution. The objective function considers costs related to: investment, operation, emission penalties, fixed and variable maintenance. The considered units are: generators, storage (batteries and hydro-pumped) and demand response units (desalination, power-to-X, electric vehicles and electrolysers). The operation is modelled as an hourly unit commitment including time-dependent startup costs and intertemporal constraints such as ramping limits and minimum up and down times. This flexibility enabling formulation boosts renewable integration and contributes towards decarbonisation of other energy sectors such as transport. A commercial solver is used to evaluate the formulation for large scale cases considering 20 years horizon and 12 full weeks per year imposing minimum renewable shares of 50 and 100% in year 9 and 19, respectively. The formulation exceeds tractability limits of previous works, achieves lower over-installation and renewable curtailment by integrating flexibility in the generation expansion problem, and allows to size demand responsive units if desired.

The model includes (i) economic variables related to the capital cost of the DERs capacity installed with their respective operational costs and (ii) operational technical constraints based on the AC power flow equations. The formulation estimates the distributed generation (DG) capacity in terms of apparent power, i.e., the capacity found by the model relates the active and reactive power injected from DG to the DN simultaneously. A linearization and a modified version of the genetic algorithm (GA) solve the mix-integer non-linear problem (MINLP), and the backward algorithm is applied to reduce the number of scenarios. The model is tested in the IEEE 69-bus system under 18 different scenarios of 24 h to measure the DERs capacity installed variability. Finally, the results showed that (i) the set of scenarios selected are decisive for the optimal capacity installed affecting the investment and the Grid dependence, (ii) the PEVs affect the total DERs capacity installed and the operation costs, and (iii) the reactive power provided by the DERs might supply the total reactive power demand.

J	Shishvan, NR; Qin, JJ; Guo, ZM				Shishvan, Nima Rashgi; Qin, Junjie; Guo, Zhaomiao			Electric vehicles' potential for smoothing daily load profile considering mobility needs and solar output	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and the growing adoption of renewable energy sources pose challenges to electricity grids, including unbalanced spatiotemporal power supply and demand, insufficient transmission and distribution capacities, and high power generation ramping needs. This study aims to better understand the potential of leveraging EVs' charging flexibility as energy storage to smooth daily power load profiles considering different solar and EV penetration levels. To achieve this goal, we propose a mathematical formulation of the charging flexibility set based on real daily trip-chain data and develop a convex optimization model to optimize the smoothness of the regional net load profile subject to the charging flexibility set. We implement the model using mobility, solar generation, and power load data in the service region of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP). Through sensitivity analyses, we quantify the potential impacts of EVs on the power systems at different levels of EV penetration, charging infrastructure availability, power load, and solar generation. The results demonstrate that EVs have the potential to smooth the overall power load if their charging/discharging scheduling can be properly coordinated. In particular, EVs can reduce the maximum ramping caused by uncoordinated charging by 65 % through the use of managed charging/discharging capabilities. Additionally, providing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities at the existing public charging stations can lead to a 29 % ramp decrease compared with only allowing V2G at home.

This study investigates the impact of wind energy uncertainty on voltage stability and energy management system (EMS) of isolated microgrids in the presence of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). A stochastic voltage stability constrained microgrid energy management system (SVSC-MEMS) architecture based on a coordinated unit commitment-optimal power flow (UC-OPF) methodology, which simultaneously considers the UC and OPF constraints, is proposed. The proposed model guarantees the system security from the voltage stability standpoint, considering a specific loading margin. Besides, the role of PEVs in the microgrid EMS is examined. In order to validate the performance of the introduced SVSC-MEMS, a CIGRE benchmark test system is used. The numerical results, obtained from the implementation of the proposed model in the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) environment, demonstrate the importance of voltage stability and wind power uncertainty on the microgrid EMS, and furthermore, the key role of PEVs in the emerging microgrids.

DERs mainly involve distributed generation and energy storage systems; however, some definitions also include electric vehicles, demand response strategies, and power electronic devices used for their coupling with power grids. DERs challenge the entire operating system owing to their heterogeneous energy generation from renewable energy sources, the probabilistic nature of electric vehicle charging, and end-user exponential integration of power electronic devices. Research on DER integration has been conducted in the academic and industrial sectors. This study proposes a schematic literature review of DERs, including its modelling, description of deterministic and probabilistic power flow methods, power grid topologies for studies, and impacts of DERs on power grid oper-ation. DERs are primarily modelled using probabilistic approaches. The most frequently optimized DER variables are sizing and location. Meanwhile, the most critical variables to analyse during their integration process to the power grid are voltage profile, frequency response, and charging of both lines and transformers, followed by less- proportional power quality indicators. Overall, DERs can improve the resilience of energy systems because they provide voltage and frequency support, reduce energy losses, enhance power quality indicators, and enhance energy recovery in extreme scenarios such as high-impact low-probability events	[Caballero-Pena, Juan; Cadena-Zarate, Cristian; Parrado-Duque, Alejandro; Osma-Pinto, German] Univ Ind Santander, Carrera 29 Calle 9, Bucaramanga 680002, Colombia		Osma-Pinto, G (corresponding author), Univ Ind Santander, Carrera 29 Calle 9, Bucaramanga 680002, Colombia.	gealosma@uis.edu.co								68	77											JUN	2022	138								107900	10.1016/j.ijepes.2021.107900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2021.107900												2025-12-09

Novel variable charging pricing strategy applied to the multi-objective planning of integrated fast and slow electric vehicle charging stations and distributed energy resources	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								Electric vehicle charging stations are increasingly being deployed to accommodate the rising demand for electric vehicles. However, this additional load on the distribution system can lead to significant challenges, including increased power losses and undervolage issues. Therefore, this paper proposes the optimized planning of electric vehicle charging stations, along with the integration of distributed energy resources considering the power system operator's perspective. The approach focuses on minimizing the costs associated with public charging stations and distributed generators, as well as reducing power losses and voltage deviation of the system. Additionally, this study incorporates both fast and slow chargers to address user requirements, while promoting the use of slow charging to help reduce the peak load demand caused by the electric vehicle charging stations. A novel variable pricing strategy for slow charging is also proposed to decrease the operator's expenses while promoting this mode of charging. The proposed methodology is validated through the integration of a 33-bus distribution test system with a 25-node traffic system. The analysis was conducted using three multi- objective optimization methods: Multi-Objective Cuckoo Search, Multi-Objective Flower Pollination Algorithm, and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. From the results, it is possible to conclude that the proposed approach provides benefits not only to the system operator but also to EV users, given the reduction in their travel costs. Despite the increased charging demand, the optimization results show a reduction in voltage deviation by 11.57%-16.94% and power losses by 19.71%-24.20% compared to the original system.

Realizing such a decentralized and dynamic infrastructure will require the ability to solve large scale problems in real-time with hundreds of thousands of DERs simultaneously online. Because of the scale of the optimization problem, we use an iterative distributed algorithm previously developed in our group to operate each DER independently and autonomously within this environment. The algorithm is deployed within a framework that allows the microgrid to dynamically adapt to changes in the operating environment. Specifically, we consider a commercial site equipped with on-site PV generation, partially curtailable load, EV charge stations and a battery electric storage unit. The site operates as a small microgrid that can participate in the wholesale market on the power grid. We report results for simulations using real-data that demonstrate the ability of the optimization framework to respond dynamically in real-time to external conditions while maintaining the functional requirements of all DERs.

Thus, it is crucial to comprehensively assess the influence of EV charging load on the distribution system. To mitigate the operational risks and optimize control measures of the power network, a two-stage time series decomposition and BiLSTM deep learning architecture is proposed for accurately predicting EV charging load series. In the first stage, a Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) evaluation method is introduced for assessing the decomposition loss, and the Lion Swarm Optimization (LSO) is employed to determine the optimal combination of decomposition parameters, thereby reducing the empirical parameter randomness and minimizing the signal loss during the decomposition process. Then, Bidirectional Short and Long-term Memory Network model (BiLSTM) is established for forecasting each sub-sequence obtained through the decomposition process. In the second stage, a DeepBiLSTM model is built to realize the accurate prediction of residual series from the first stage. The performance of the proposed architecture was tested using real-world charging load data collected from EV stations located in Southern China. It demonstrates that our proposed forecasting method can outperform traditional algorithms in terms of MAPE and RMSE metrics for 1h-ahead, 2h-ahead, 4h-ahead, and 24h-ahead EV load prediction.

Charging station siting and sizing are two key challenges in the planning with each of them being a complex optimization problem. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to solve them together. First, considering that accurate charging demand estimation is crucial for planning, a traffic road network is established for this purpose. A Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of charging demand in a region based on the probabilistic characteristics of user trips. Since uncoordinated charging not only increases the load but also leads to unstable operation of the local power system, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to coordinate charging scheduling. Then, based on the scheduled demand, this paper proposes a framework for the siting and sizing of charging stations to optimize the benefits for both operators and users by minimizing the construction, operation and maintenance costs, and the user's detour time. As the given problem is a complex multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, it is easy to fall into local optimum if traditional evolutionary algorithms are employed. Therefore, a multi-objective dynamic binary particle swarm optimization method is designed to solve this problem effectively. Finally, experimental simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the other comparative algorithms in terms of solution quality. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing the location and capacity of charging stations.

Long waiting times at charging stations are a major barrier to the widespread adoption of EVs. Therefore, battery swapping stations (BSSs) are an efficient solution that considers short waiting times and healthy recharging cycles for battery systems. Moreover, swapping stations have emerged as a great opportunity not only for EVs, but also for power systems, with regulation services that can be provided to the grid particularly for small networks, such as microgrid (MG) systems. In this study, the optimum location and size that maximize the revenue of a swap station in an MG system are investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this study is first to solve the placing and sizing problem in the MG from the perspective of a BSS. The results indicate that bus 23 is the BSS's optimal location and is crucial for maximizing revenue and addressing issues like the provision of ancillary services in microgrid system. Finally, the swap demand profile of the station serving electric bus public transportation system was obtained using an analytical model based on public transportation data collected in Berlin, Germany.

In this context, aggregation entities are helpful for addressing the integration process of EV fleets. In this article, a novel methodology for day-ahead charging control of EV fleets is proposed. This includes the prediction of required energy used for charging purposes based on synthetic data and functionalities for optimized energy procurement in the day-ahead energy market to determine the aggregated charging schedule of the fleet. The aggregated charging schedule provides the basis for the proposed charging control algorithm for individual EVs. This algorithm allows for charging flexibility according to the user's driving preferences while considering data privacy. To avoid data privacy conflicts, the scheduling of the individual charging is decoupled from the upcoming individual driving schedules of the users themselves. This means that the user is not asked to plan and submit expected driving profiles. Instead, realization is by a user-oriented disaggregation that uses the aggregated charging schedule as an input to coordinate the individual charging processes itself. The resulting integrative market solution allows to fulfill the contract positions in energy market participation. The simulation results verify the optimality of the proposed methodology for day-ahead operation and its applicability for aggregation entities that serve as an intermediate between the vehicle owners and electrical utilities or the energy market.

A Planning Approach for the Network Configuration of AC-DC Hybrid Distribution Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				Article								This paper proposes a novel stochastic planning model for AC-DC hybrid distribution systems (DSs). Taking into account the possibility of each line/bus being AC or DC, the model finds the optimal AC-DC hybrid configuration of buses and lines in the DS. It incorporates consideration of the stochastic behavior of load demands and renewable-based distributed generators (DGs). The stochastic variations are addressed using a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. The objective of the planning model is the minimization of DS installation and operation costs. The optimal planning solution is obtained by dividing the hybrid planning problem into two nested optimization problems: 1) the main problem is formulated using a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the optimal AC-DC configuration and 2) the subproblem is used for determining the optimal power flow solution for each configuration generated by the GA. The proposed model has been employed for finding the optimal configuration for a suggested case study that included photovoltaic panels, wind-based DG, and electric vehicle charging stations. The same case study was also solved using a traditional AC planning technique in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the associated cost-savings. The results demonstrate the advantages offered by the proposed model. The proposed framework represents an effective technique that can be used by DS operators to identify the optimal AC-DC network configuration of future DSs.	[Ahmed, Haytham M.

Firstly, this paper establishes a hybrid electric vehicle power system model. Secondly, a hierarchical energy optimization control architecture based on networked information is designed, and a traffic signal timing model is used for vehicle target speed range planning in the upper system. More specifically, the optimal vehicle speed is optimized by a model predictive control algorithm. Thirdly, a mathematical model of vehicle speed variation in connected and unconnected states is established to analyze the effect of vehicle speed planning on fuel economy. Finally, three learning-based energy optimization control strategies, namely Q-learning, deep Q network (DQN), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, are designed under the hierarchical energy optimization control architecture. It is shown that the Q-learning algorithm is able to optimize energy control; however, the agent will meet the "dimension disaster" once it faces a high-dimensional state space issue. Then, a DQN control strategy is introduced to address the problem. Due to the limitation of the discrete output of DQN, the DDPG algorithm is put forward to achieve continuous action control. In the simulation, the superiority of the DDPG algorithm over Q-learning and DQN algorithms in hybrid electric vehicles is illustrated in terms of its robustness and faster convergence for better energy management purposes.

Accurate characterization of EV, PV and net load energy profiles is necessary to plan new installations and to develop forecasting methodologies. This paper provides a novel contribution to the energy profile characterization of EVs and PVs, exploiting clustering techniques in a hierarchical framework to eventually characterize the overall net load profiles. In the proposal, the lower levels of the hierarchy identify clusters of EV load and PV generation profiles at individual installations, alternatively using one clustering technique among DBSCAN, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), K-means algorithm (KMA), and spectral clustering (SC). The intermediate levels of the hierarchy reconstruct the overall EV load and PV generation profiles through a proposed frequentist combination of the lower-level profiles. The upper level of the hierarchy characterizes the overall net load through a novel approach based on the quantile convolution of the intermediate-level EV and PV profiles. Real EV load and PV generation data are used to evaluate the performance of the presented hierarchical methodology, with relative fitting improvements between 1% and 8% (compared to a two-level hierarchical benchmark) and between 16% and 29% (compared to a direct, non-hierarchical benchmark).

With the proper charging and discharging of EVs with vehicle-to-grid (V2G), electrical system can get controllable storage/generations and at the same time, EV owners can earn profits. This paper presents a novel dispatch strategy to determine, when and at what rate EV battery should charge/discharge in order to maximize profits to EV owners and responding to power system's requirements while considering the effect of renewable DG power availability. This objective depends on many criteria like buying and selling price of energy, battery state of charge (SoC), Renewable DG power availability, and load leveling. To solve these, a new multi-criteria decision analysis method, Probabilistic Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (p-ELECTRE), is developed. The proposed optimal dispatch strategy is applied to 100 and 200 EV fleets with random travel plan. Further, the effect of these fleets with optimal dispatch strategy is tested on IEEE 33 bus distribution system with added DGs. Furthermore, optimal power dispatch of DGs in EV-rich distribution system is obtained by BAT optimization algorithm (BOA). The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the proposed technique.

The approach aims to mitigate voltage unbalance, reduce power losses, alleviate feeder congestion, and maximize the hosting capacity (HC) of RESs in grid-connected unbalanced microgrids. By employing smart inverter control for photovoltaic (PV) and ESS inverters, the strategy enhances the integration of additional RESs while minimizing power exchange between operational zones and the utility grid (UG). To achieve such an ambitious goal, smart inverter control functions are employed, including combined mode, volt-var (VV), volt-watt (VW) for Photovoltaic (PV) inverters, and VW for ESS inverters. The IEEE 123-bus test system, divided into six operational zones, is used as a case study, incorporating plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) demand and wind-based distributed generation (DG). A metaheuristic algorithm is developed for optimal DG and ESS deployment using MATLAB and OpenDSS. The results demonstrate significant improvements, including a 16% reduction in feeder congestion, a 150% increase in PV penetration, a 13% reduction in power losses, and decreased reliance on the UG, ensuring enhanced power quality and system reliability.

However, the increasing charging demand of EVs also brings challenges to future smart grids. To cope with the EV diffusion, this paper presents an adaptive fast charging station (FCS) strategy that considers the integrated network planning and quality of service (QoS) guarantee. First, based on the EV diffusion model and the proposed EV-integrated traffic assignment model, the charging demands at different regions and stages are forecasted. Based on the predicted spatial and temporal EV charging demand, a multistage stochastic distribution expansion planning model is presented, where the distribution network assets and FCSs are jointly considered. To guarantee the quality of the fast-charging services under EV diffusion, a QoS assessment is conducted based on the average waiting time and the average number of dissatisfied leaves. Finally, the proposed planning model allows several alternatives at both the distribution and transmission levels. The cost of electricity network expansion planning is considered as the adaptive cost arisen from the EV diffusion and the increase of the other electrical loads. We aim to find a planning strategy that can adapt to different penetration levels of EVs. The proposed framework and methodology are verified on the IEEE 24-bus power system encompassing 6 IEEE 33-bus distribution networks. It is found out that the proposed strategy shows superiority in both QoS and total costs.

Optimal Operation of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment by Aggregators in Local Energy Community	IEEE ACCESS				Article								This paper proposes a centralized energy management system for low voltage (LV) distribution networks. The main contribution of this model is to manage the energy serving at the local energy communities in the presence of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Unlocking the demand response potential by the EVSE at the distribution network with the contribution of the active residential prosumers has been investigated in this study under different operational planning scenarios. The developed model is based on the multi-temporal optimal power flow (MTOPF) concept while the unbalanced nature of LV networks has been addressed using unbalanced power flow equations. The aggregator can effectively manage the optimal charging of electric vehicles (EVs) by home and public chargers available at the distribution network. Simulation results on a modified unbalanced LV network illustrate that the optimal operation of EVSE minimizes the electricity costs of end-users. The simulation results show that the operating costs and systems losses reduce by 9.22% and 43.45%, respectively. These results have been obtained considering the switching actions and 100% PV power generation index using the presented MV-LV coordinated operational model. Besides, the energy storage systems improve the peak-to-average (PAR) ratio by 9.87%.	[Nezhad, Ali Esmaeel; Sabour, Toktam Tavakkoli; Joshi, R.

It is an intricate system involving numerous variables that are spread over different levels: architecture, component technologies, sizing, and control. There is currently a lack of frameworks or tools that help in exploring the entire design space and in finding the global optimal solution throughout these levels. This article proposes a systematic methodology that tries to answer a part of this need. Starting from a set of chosen components, the methodology automatically generates all the possible graphs of architectures using constraint-programming techniques. A tailored representation is developed to picture the graphs. They are then transformed into other types of representation (tables describing the connections and the powertrain modes). Based on these representations, the architectures are automatically filtered and the most promising ones are selected. They are automatically assessed and optimized using a specifically developed general hybrid model that calculates the performance and fuel consumption of all the generated architectures. This model is inserted inside a bi-level optimization process: a Genetic Algorithm is used on the sizing and components level, while the Dynamic Programming is used on the control level. A case study is performed and the capability of the methodology is proven.

Due to this fact, a lot more challenges are being encountered in the development of electrified transportation in India; with the scarcity of viable charging stations posing as a significant bottleneck. In this study, the techno-economic analysis of different solar-based charging schemes that are available in the existing environment and present a modest, economical and reliable method of charging an electric vehicle (EV) )(e.g. e-rickshaw) through a solar panel that ultimately enhances the driving range and overall reliability of the system has been done. To validate the performance, the prototype of vehicle-integrated photovoltaic (PV) charging system has been developed and test results are demonstrated.

This article presents a strategy for calculating spatiotemporal operational emissions (OEs) of road transportation and the electric grid to quantify the impact of transportation electrification. Emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles and offset emissions from electric vehicles (EVs) are considered using actual transportation networks and travel data. The spatiotemporal charging demand for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EVs is estimated in a behaviorally informed way and mapped to electrical buses within the power grid and an ac optimal power flow with unit commitment is solved. The methodology is demonstrated with ten scenarios simulated on a grid with 7000 electrical buses geographically sited in Texas, created with actual generator data for the 2020 grid, and a future case, including anticipated generator updates by 2030. Results show overall transportation emission reductions in daily OEs of up to 20%-30% for all pollutants studied, outweighing the increase in emissions from the electric grid. Considering emissions on an hourly basis, up to approximately 1000% reduction in CO emissions is observed.

J	Muratori, M; Rizzoni, G				Muratori, Matteo; Rizzoni, Giorgio			Residential Demand Response: Dynamic Energy Management and Time-Varying Electricity Pricing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS				Article								Demand response programs are currently being proposed as a solution to deal with issues related to peak demand and to improve the operation of the electric power system. In the demand response paradigm, electric utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity consumption. In this paper, a dynamic energy management framework, based on highly resolved energy consumption models, is used to simulate automated residential demand response. The models estimate the residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies consumer energy use behavior, thus providing an accurate estimation of the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all of the controllable appliances, including plug-in electric vehicles, is found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures. Recently, time-varying electricity rate plans have been proposed by electric utilities as an incentive to their customers with the objective of re-shaping the aggregate demand. Large-scale simulations are performed to analyze and quantitatively assess the impact of demand response programs using different electricity price structures. Results show that simple time-varying electricity price structures, coupled with large-scale adoption of automated energy management systems, might create pronounced rebound peaks in the aggregate residential demand. To cope with the rebound peaks created by the synchronization of the individual residential demands, innovative electricity price structures-called Multi-TOU and Multi-CPP-are proposed.

J	Liu, WJ; Wang, XJ; Xu, YJ				Liu, Wenjie; Wang, Xijun; Xu, Yunjian			Bilevel Planning of Wireless Charging Lanes in Coupled Transportation and Power Distribution Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION				Article								A new bilevel optimization framework is developed for the optimal deployment of wireless charging lanes (WCLs) in coupled transportation and power distribution networks (PDNs), with explicit incorporation of: 1) the impact of deployment decisions on the traffic flow and charging demand of electric vehicles (EVs) and 2) the total charging power limit of WCL infrastructure. At the upper level, a distribution company decides the optimal deployment of WCL, subject to PDN constraints. With the upper-level WCL deployment decisions, in the lower level, each EV makes optimal routing and charging decisions to minimize the sum of its travel and charging costs. The proposed bilevel model is reformulated to a single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) by replacing the lower-level problem with its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. A simplified special ordered set Type 1 (SOS1)-based method is developed to linearize the complementary conditions, avoiding the selection of a proper big constant (as in the big- M method). Numerical simulations on a Hong Kong transportation network (TN) and the IEEE 118-node test system demonstrate that the proposed bilevel framework reduces the vehicle owner cost by 8% and 5.3%, compared with the single-level and multiobjective planning frameworks. Ignorance of the WCL total charging power limit can lead to 46%-107% deviation from the optimal deployed WCL length when the wireless charging EV adoption rate ranges from 15% to 30%.

Feasibility Study for Electric Vehicle Usage in a Microgrid Integrated With Renewable Energy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION				Article								Electric vehicles (EVs) are getting increased attention due to their potential as reliable sources of transportation. In addition, EVs can be employed as a temporary energy storage system (ESS) in electrical power systems using the grid-to-vehicle (G2V), charging phase, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G), discharging phase, technologies. Renewable energy resources (RERs) are a clean and sustainable form of energy but are often intermittent in nature. Integrating ESS with RERs can mitigate the unpredictable fluctuations of the electrical power generated from RERs, but the investment cost of installing ESS is often high. In this article, we investigate the financial benefit obtained from using EVs as a temporary ESS in a microgrid (MG) integrated with a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The problem formulation considers the capital cost of the EV charging stations (EVCSs), feed-in tariff (FIT), and incentives given to the EVs' owners. A planning algorithm is developed to find the required number of EVCSs needed to maximize the profit of the suggested system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using the Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) MG. Four different final state of charge (SC) of EV scenarios are considered. Results show that the suggested system can be economically and technically feasible. Employing EVs, in G2V and V2G schemes, decreases the MG dependency on the grid and yields annual profit as well.

A properly sized HESS and an implementable real-time power management system are of great importance to achieve satisfactory driving mileage and battery cycle life. However, dimensioning and power management problems are quite complicated and challenging in practice. To address these challenges, this article proposes a bilevel multiobjective design and control framework with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II and fuzzy logic control (FLC) as key components, to obtain an optimal sized HESS and the corresponding optimal real-time power management system based on FLC simultaneously. In particular, a vectorized fuzzy inference system is devised, which allows large-scale fuzzy logic controllers to run in parallel, thereby improving optimization efficiency. Pareto optimal results of different HESSs incorporating both optimal design and control parameters are obtained efficiently thanks to the vectorization. An example solution chosen from the Pareto front shows that the proposed method can achieve a competitive number of covered laps while improving the battery cycle life significantly.

Smart distribution system operational scheduling considering electric vehicle parking lot and demand response programs	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								Electric vehicle (EV) technology with a vehicle to grid (V2G) property is used in power systems to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, reduce peak load of the distribution system, provide ancillary service, etc. In addition, demand response (DR) programs as an effective strategy can provide an opportunity for consumers to play a significant role in the planning and operation of a smart distribution company (SDISCO) by reducing or shifting their demand, especially during the on-peak period. In this paper, the optimal operation of a SDISCO is evaluated, including renewable energy resources (RERs) along with EV parking lots (PLs). RER and PL uncertainties and a suitable charging/discharging schedule of EVs are also considered. Furthermore, price-based DR programs and incentive-based DR programs are used for operational scheduling. To achieve this aim, a techno-economic formulation is developed in which the SDISCO acts as the owner of RERs and PLs. Moreover, DR programs are prioritized by using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate different factors that affect the operational scheduling of the SDISCO. The proposed model is tested on the IEEE 15-bus distribution system over a 24-h period, and the results prove the effectiveness of the model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, ZQ; Hou, SZ; Guo, W				Wang, Ziqi; Hou, Sizu; Guo, Wei			Inventory management of battery swapping and charging stations considering uncertainty	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The battery swapping mode of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to play an essential role in transportation and power systems. Plenty of batteries are managed by the battery swapping and charging stations (BSCSs) as the core assets. Proper inventory scale and charging/discharging control of batteries are essential to the planning and operation of BSCSs. This paper addresses two critical aspects of BSCS batteries: the optimal amount of inventory batteries and the tradeoff between the initial number of depleted and fully-charged batteries at the beginning of each scheduling horizon. Aiming at these, the time coupling between initial inventory, charging/discharging strategy, and swapping time sequence is analyzed. Afterward, it establishes the initial inventory based charging/ discharging (IIC) model. The uncertain swapping demand is fully considered by utilizing a data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach with an improved K-means clustering algorithm. A duality-free column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm solves the problem iteratively. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the IIC model and show that the obtained optimization results achieve the balance of economy and robustness. Moreover, the impact of battery technology development on inventory batteries is analyzed, and suggestions are given.

J	Tu, J; Bai, ZF; Wu, XL				Tu, Jian; Bai, Zhifeng; Wu, Xiaolan			Sizing of a Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle with the Hybrid Energy Storage System	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								For plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), using a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) instead of a single battery system can prolong the battery life and reduce the vehicle cost. To develop a PHEV with HESS, it is a key link to obtain the optimal size of the power supply and energy system that can meet the load requirements of a driving cycle. Since little effort has been dedicated to simultaneously performing the component sizing of PHEV and HESS, this paper proposes an approach based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to simultaneously determine the sizes of the engine, motor, battery and supercapacitor (SC) in a PHEV with HESS. The drivetrain cost is minimized in a different all-electric range (AER)-and depends on the battery type-while ensuring the driving performance requirements. In addition, the effects of the power system and drive cycle on the component sizes were analyzed and compared. The simulation results show that the cost of the PHEV drivetrain with the Ni-MH battery/SC HESS is reduced by up to 12.21% when compared to the drivetrain with the Li-ion battery/SC HESS. The drivetrain cost is reduced by 8.79% when compared to analysis-based optimization. The type of power supply system and drive cycle can significantly affect the optimization results.

A data-driven probabilistic framework for estimating grid impacts of EV charging at scale	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The rapid uptake of electric vehicles presents both opportunities and challenges for modern power systems. As charging demand increases, intelligent and data-driven approaches are essential to predict and manage future grid impacts. This paper presents a probabilistic and data-driven approach for generating realistic electric vehicle charging profiles, which can be integrated into probabilistic load flow simulations to assess their effect on grid capacity. In contrast to many existing studies that focus on low-voltage grids, this work targets the sub-transmission grid, analyzing the impact of aggregated charging demand. The approach is applied to a Swedish sub-transmission grid using a combination of real-world data: travel statistics, demographic data, charger usage rates, and two empirical home charging datasets, one representing uncoordinated charging, and another incorporating smart charging technologies. The methodology generates synthetic but realistic charging demand profiles, which are coupled to a full-scale grid model to evaluate the system under 100 % fleet electrification. Results show that substantial congestion may emerge in the primary substation transformers, which may, to some extent, be mitigated by adopting planned or intelligent charging strategies. By combining real-world data with a detailed grid model and a probabilistic modeling approach, the study lays a foundation for analyzing grid impacts under high EV penetration and supports the development of flexibility services to inform more proactive grid planning.

The introduced strategy is realized at the electrical power transmission level and takes into account the collaboration between VPPs in day-ahead energy and reserve markets. One notable feature of the proposed strategy is attempting to make the revenue of VPPs close to the operating cost of generating units as much as possible. The objective function is subjected to the network-constrained unit commitment model, up and down reserve requirements and the proposed VPP constraints. This method is taking into account the uncertainty in system and VPP loads, day-ahead market energy and reserve price and WF power generation. This strategy is applied as hybrid stochastic-robust scheduling to the VPP at the electrical power transmission level, where the scenario-based stochastic programming models the uncertainty of day-ahead market prices, and the bounded uncertainty-based robust optimization has been adopted to model the uncertainties related to the load and WF power. Scheme has been tested on IEEE systems. According to the obtained results, the proposed coordination of VPPs in the mentioned markets demonstrates capability of suggested strategy.

The effort taken to diminish the deviation in demand-supply balance is greatly influenced by demand response (DR) strategy. In this analysis, the concept of DR is incorporated via the approach of load management. The optimal scheduling of the load considering the available energy helps to avoid unessential load shedding. The DR strategy of load shifting is suggested at different levels in accordance with the nature of load and real-time price. The profit of the utility is enhanced by providing the customer the flexibility to schedule their load. The curtailment of load can be avoided by increased customer participation in the suggested DR programs. The operating system is designed to be both efficient and effective by utilizing the real-time tariff profile of electricity to plan the generation of renewable energy, energy storage systems that include electric vehicles, and the utilization of grid power. The scalability and generalization of the proposed DR approach make it suitable for large-scale power systems that integrate renewable energy sources. The validation of the proposed method using reliability analysis ensures the effectiveness of the formulated DR. The proposed method is tested under two different scenarios and topologies on the IEEE-33 bus system and the results accomplished are promising.	[Sivasankari, G.

This increases uncertainty in power systems. On the other hand, reactive power plays a key role in voltage stability, so modeling reactive power planning in TEP is very important. The amount of reactive power is a determining factor regarding the stability of the network voltage and in case of shortage, occurrence of some events may endanger the voltage stability. This research aims at proposing a hybrid TEP and reactive power planning for the first time. Furthermore, the impact of wind, PV power plants, and EVs, as the common sources of uncertainties, are included. The ultimate goal of HTEP-RPP is to find the transmission line candidates that meet the reactive power requirements. The simulation case studies on IEEE 24- and 118- buses confirm that the TEP based on DCPF may lead to some unreliable operating conditions due to violating the voltage constraints. In this case, the HTEP-RPP results, by applying the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), are more comprehensive and effective than the results obtained by gravitational search algorithm (GSA), for the studied problem or even the popular TEP solutions.

Vincent			Joint Energy Procurement and Demand Response Towards Optimal Deployment of Renewables	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING				Article								In this paper, joint energy procurement and demand response is studied from the perspective of the operator of a power system. The operator procures energy from both renewable energy sources (RESs) and the spot market. We observe the fact that the RESs may incur considerable infrastructure cost. This cost is taken into account and the optimal planning of renewables is examined by controlling the investment in RES infrastructures. Due to the uncertainty of renewables, the operator can also purchase energy directly from the spot market to compensate for the possible deficit incurred by the realization of the random renewable energy. By setting appropriate prices, the operator sells the collected energy to heterogeneous end users with different demand response characteristics. We model the decision making process of the operator as a two-stage optimization problem. The optimal decisions on the renewable deployment, energy purchase from the spot market, and pricing schemes are derived. Several solution structures are observed and a computationally efficient algorithm, requiring only closed-form calculation and simple bisection search, is proposed to compute the optimal decisions. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the optimality of the proposed algorithm and the solution structures observed theoretically. In particular, the impact of renewable penetration and the importance of its optimal design are highlighted.	[Cao, Xuanyu; Poor, H.

The system power loss and node voltage excursion can be effectively reduced, by taking measures of time-of-use (TOU) price mechanism bonded with the reactive compensation of energy storage devices. Firstly, the coordinate charging/discharging load model for EV has been established, to obtain a narrowed gap between load peak and valley. Next, a multi-objective optimization model of the distribution grid is also defined, and the active power loss and node voltage fluctuation are chosen to be the objective function. For improving the efficiency of optimization process, an advanced genetic algorithm associated with elite preservation policy is used. Finally, reactive compensation capacity supplied by capacitor banks is dynamically determined according to the varying building loads. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on the IEEE 33-node test case, and the simulation results show that the power supply pressure can be obviously relieved by introducing the coordinated charging/discharging behavior of EV; in the meantime, via reasonable planning of the compensation capacitor, the remarkably lower active power loss and voltage excursion can be realized, ensuring the safe and economical operation of the distribution system.

Battery energy storage (BES) units have many advantages and are used for several purposes in electric systems and distribution grids. They are used not only for peak shaving and voltage regulation, but also for reliability enhancement and dispatching the renewable-based distributed generation (DG) sources. However, BES technologies are still expensive and need to be employed optimally to prevent excess investment cost. Optimal planning of BES is a complex approach that determines the type, location, capacity and power rating of energy storage units. The optimization should handle the uncertain conditions and it requires to develop the appropriate models and methods. There are many effective components that should be addressed. These components influence the results of the optimal planning and make it more complicated. In this chapter the optimal BES planning methodologies are presented. Firstly the optimization problem is formulated considering different economic perspectives. Then the approaches and strategies for solving the combinatorial problem are described. In this way, both the probabilistic and possibilistic methods and models are displayed.

The model aims to schedule the power among the different microgrid units while minimising the operating costs together with the CO(2)emissions produced. A storage device is added where the charge and discharge schedule is calculated according to both objectives. In addition, as a part of the demand side participation strategy, a charging schedule was determined for the electric vehicles (EV) in order to increase the system security and further reduce the costs and emissions. A congestion management approach is also introduced, which eliminates congestions by effective unit scheduling according to congestion signals provided by the distribution system operators. The complete day-ahead time horizon is divided in 96 time steps (each with a 15 min time span), which makes the UC problem more complicated. The studied system includes renewable energy resources, a storage unit, two microturbines, a fuel cell and EVs. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is robust and is able to reduce the microgrid operating costs and emissions by optimal scheduling of the microgrid units, and is able to take into account local congestion problems.

Many electric aircraft (EA) prototypes with a fully electrically powered propulsion system for short-haul commuting air transport have been designed in recent years. Planning and designing the ground power systems and associated electric aircraft charging facilities are also essential for realising aviation electrification. In this work, a bi-objective infrastructure planning framework for airport microgrid to accommodate parking lot electric vehicles (EVs) and EA is developed, and the impact of V2G on the airport microgrid is assessed. The dispatching problem of the airport microgrid is formulated as a heuristic optimisation problem, and the NSGA-II algorithm is adopted to find the Pareto Fronts and optimal solutions. There are two different scheduling strategies for charging EA: plug-in charge and battery swap. The economic and technological assessments for both strategies are conducted and compared. The results show that adopting V2G strategy can improve the airport microgrid economic performance. In general, the EA plug-in charge strategy performs better than the EA battery strategy in terms of microgrid resilience, while the EA battery swap strategy can reduce the operation costs of the airport microgrid.

A major challenge that residential distribution grids are going to encounter with the integration of photovoltaic (PV) panels and electric vehicles (EVs) is the unsynchronized new demand and the time-limited production of distributed generation, in combination with space limitations. Therefore, the necessity of energy storage systems (ESSs) is more than evident. ESSs have excessive manufacturing costs, implying that the purchase cost for residential users can be prohibitive. In the present work, a distributed optimal small-scale PV energy system sizing strategy is proposed, by considering the individual energy needs of each residence and their EVs. The strategy is formulated based on the demand of the households and EVs' charging. By enabling the fuzzy cognitive maps theory, a graph is designed, aiming to establish the correlation among the individual energy parameters and the characteristics of the renewable energy sources (RES). The optimization results reveal that the adopted hybrid approach can reduce the energy cost significantly, up to almost 40%, while enabling distribution system operators (DSOs) to incorporate additional loads, without the need for network expansion. Finally, based on the extracted results, a short discussion about the concept of EVs' charging by residential RES is presented.

One of the new loads is the battery charging station for electric vehicles or electric buses. The charging load will have a charge that varies with the operating time of each vehicle. Therefore, this article focuses on optimal capacitor location and sizing for reducing the power loss on the power distribution systems due to the dynamic load of the electric bus system using the artificial bee colony algorithm. The dynamic charging load of 3 types of electric bus systems was applied: Plug-in charging, Pantograph charging, and Battery swapping charging. The simulation results show that the installation of 0.3167 MVar capacitors for Plug-in electric bus systems reduced the power loss by 0.5465 MWh. In comparison, the installation of 0.2893 MVar capacitors for the Pantograph electric bus systems reduces the power loss by 0.5459 MWh. The installation of 0.2922 MVar capacitors for the Battery swapping systems reduces the power loss of 0.5517 MWh.

J	Trinh, PH; Zafar, R; Chung, IY				Trinh, Phi-Hai; Zafar, Rehman; Chung, Il-Yop			Optimal PEV Charging and Discharging Algorithms to Reduce Operational Cost of Microgrid Using Adaptive Rolling Horizon Framework	IEEE ACCESS				Article								This paper presents an optimal operation algorithm for a grid-connected microgrid that incorporates renewable energy sources (RESs), plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging/discharging stations, and local loads. The aim of this work is to not only propose a microgrid operating algorithm but also implement it within the microgrid energy management system. The primary objective of the proposed algorithm is to reduce the overall operational cost of the microgrid while minimizing the PEV charging bills simultaneously. To this end, we propose an adaptive PEV power charging/discharging and power exchange (grid exporting/importing) scheduling strategy that accounts for the uncertainty of RES power generation, loads, and electric pricing. To address the dynamic arrival of PEVs, we propose an online optimization scheme using an adaptive rolling horizon framework. The size of the rolling window is adjusted in each time step to adapt to the dynamic nature of the PEV charging period. Additionally, we propose the design of a dynamic pricing model for PEV charging and discharging to achieve power system balance within the microgrid, thereby optimizing operating costs and minimizing PEV charging bills further. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, which are expected to benefit both the microgrid operators and PEV owners.

Optimizing the technical and economic value of energy storage systems in LV networks for DNO applications	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								Electrical energy production from renewable energy sources and electrification of consumer energy demand are developments in the ongoing energy transition. These developments urge the demand for flexibility in low voltage distribution networks, on the one hand caused by the intermittency of renewable energy sources, and on the other hand by the high power demand of battery electric vehicles and heat pumps. One of the foremost ways to create flexibility is by using energy storage systems. This paper proposes a method to first optimize the siting, power and capacity rating, technology, and operation of energy storage systems based on the technical and economic value. Secondly the method can be used to make cost-and time-based network planning decisions between network upgrades and network upgrade deferral by energy storage systems. To demonstrate the proposed method, study cases are analyzed of five low voltage distribution networks with different penetrations of photovoltaics, heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. The optimal energy storage systems in the study cases are: flow batteries sited at over 50% of the cable length with a high capacity rating per euro. With the current state of energy storage system development, network upgrade deferral is up to 61% cheaper than network upgrades in the study cases. The energy storage systems can offer additional value by reducing the peak loading of the medium voltage grid which is not taken into account in this research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the surge in charging demand not only causes voltage fluctuations and a decline in power quality but also leads to tension in the power grid load in some areas. The complexity of urban road networks further increases the challenge of charging station planning. Although laying out charging stations in areas with high traffic flow can better meet traffic demands, it may also damage power quality due to excessive grid load. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an optimized layout plan for electric vehicle charging stations considering the coupling effects of roads and electricity. By using section power flow to extract dynamic data from the power distribution network and comparing the original daily load curves of the power grid and electric vehicles, this paper plans reasonable capacity and charging/discharging schemes for EVCSs. It considers the impact of the charging and discharging characteristics of EVCSs on the power grid while satisfying the peak-shaving and valley-filling regulation benefits. Combined with the traffic road network, the optimization objectives include optimizing the voltage deviation, transmission line margin, network loss, traffic flow, and service range of charging stations. The Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is used for solving, and the optimal layout plan for electric vehicle charging stations is obtained. Finally, through road-electricity coupling network simulation verification, the proposed optimal planning scheme effectively expands the charging service range of electric vehicles, with a coverage rate of 83.33%, alleviating users' charging anxiety and minimizing the impact on the power grid, verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme.

In this study, a practical HEMS model with renewable energy, storage devices and plug-in electric vehicles, considering the battery sustainability and the full utilisation of the renewable energy, is first established. Then, according to the combinations of the genetic algorithm (GA) and the multi-constrained integer programming method, an improved GA is proposed, which goal is to minimise the electricity purchase and maximise the renewable energy utilisation. Finally, it is demonstrated by an example that the proposed method is significant in cost saving and reducing energy wastes. To verify the performances of the proposed algorithm, the numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm has high computational efficiency and good robustness. In addition, it can avoid the disadvantages easy to trap at a local optimal point, and are insensitive to initial solutions. The effect of the storage device on system property and the sensitivity of cost savings versus demand response, size of the battery, and the electricity price sell to the grid are also analysed.

This interplay, if neglected, can result in uncovered EVs and security issues and even hinder the effective diffusion of EVs. In this paper, we explicitly incorporate this interdependence by quantifying EV adoption rates as decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) using decision-dependent ambiguity sets (DDASs). Then, a two-stage decision-dependent distributionally robust FCS planning (D3R-FCSP) model is developed for adaptively deploying FCSs with on-site sources and expanding the coupled distribution network. A multi-period capacitated arc cover-path cover (MCACPC) model is incorporated to capture the EVs' recharging patterns to ensure the feasibility of FCS locations and capacities. To resolve the nonlinearity and nonconvexity, the D3R-FCSP model is equivalently reformulated into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming by exploiting its strong duality and applying the McCormick envelope. Finally, case studies highlight the superior out-of-sample performances of our model in terms of security and cost-efficiency. Furthermore, the byproduct of accelerated EV adoption through an implicit positive feedback loop is highlighted.

Nevertheless, this device's mass is irrelevant when evaluating the performance of such a system in terms of density, so it must be reduced to achieve maximum performance. This can be achieved with the solution presented in this paper: a coupling architecture based on a controlled current source, in which the DC-DC converter's processed power depends on the voltage difference between the two sources. If this difference is zero, so is the power processed by the converter. Minimizing this power leads to a reduction of the converter's mass and volume, increasing system performance. In this paper, the controlled current source cascade architecture combines two lithium-ion batteries to supply a limited-range electric vehicle. Its operation is addressed and validated by simulation and experimental results. For the experimental validation, the batteries and the load were emulated by power supplies, with a 2 kg, 3.3 kW evaluation board serving as DC-DC converter. The findings reveal that the examined architecture enables a substantial reduction in the converter's sizing power, up to a factor of 14 compared to a conventional solution commonly seen in the literature.

EV charging management integration requires a smart grid platform that allows for communication and control between the aggregator, consumer and grid. This study presents an operational strategy for PV-assisted charging stations (PVCSs) that allows the EV to be charged primarily by PV energy, followed by the EV station's battery storage (BS) and the grid. Multi-Aggregator collaborative scheduling is considered that includes a monetary penalty on the aggregator for any unscheduled EVs. The impact of the PVCS is compared to the case with no PV/BS is included. A variation in the PV profile is included in the evaluation to assess its impact on total profits. Profit results are compared in cases of minimum, average and maximum PV energy output. The results indicate that the inclusion of penalties due to unscheduled EVs resulted in lowered profits. Further, the profits experienced an increase as the number of EVs scheduled through PV/BS increased, implying that a lesser percentage of EVs are scheduled by the grid when a greater amount of PV and battery energy are available.

To support this transition, the expansion of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) has become essential to meet the increasing charging demand. However, although EV usage can reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation sector, existing planning approaches often overlook the CO(2 )emissions generated by the construction of EVCSs. This omission may undermine the environmental benefits of EV adoption, as the cost of mitigating construction-related emissions could offset the savings from reduced transportation emissions. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel EVCS expansion framework that integrates construction-related CO(2 )emission cost into the overall optimization model. The proposed approach jointly considers the costs incurred by Charging Station Owners (CSOs), EV users, and the environmental impact from EVCS construction. A realistic urban road network and EV charging behavior are modeled in detail, and Binary Differential Evolution (BDE) is employed to determine the optimal sizing and locations of EVCSs. The results demonstrate that incorporating construction-related CO(2 )emission costs leads to a total cost reduction of 2.06% compared to conventional methods that do not consider such CO(2 )emissions. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating environmental externalities, such as construction-related CO(2 )emissions, into infrastructure planning to reduce long-term costs, mitigate potential carbon tax impacts, and support cost-effective and sustainable EVCS deployment.

To this end, a novel multi-station integration planning method and coordinated operation strategy model for the MSIS are established in a new business model. In this study, a new business model of the MSIS, with substations as the carrier, integrating distributed photovoltaic, energy storage, electric vehicle charging, data center, and 5G base stations is proposed. From the social environment, natural conditions, and complementary characteristics, a comprehensive index system is established to analyze expansion capability of substations and multi-station combination scheme. Scenario reduction is performed by extracting feature vectors and building a comprehensive evaluation function to select the optimal combination scheme under a specific scenario. Moreover, for the combination scheme in a specific scenario, the optimal capacity configuration and coordinated operation strategy chance-constrained programming model of the MSIS are established under different operating conditions. Finally, simulations are performed on a practical MSIS located in Wuxi, China, and simulation results demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the planning method and coordinated operation strategy model for the MSIS.

J	Knez, K; Herman, L; Ilkovski, M; Blazic, B				Knez, Klemen; Herman, Leopold; Ilkovski, Marjan; Blazic, Bostjan			Long-term planning of Low-Voltage networks using reference network Models: Slovenian use case	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), electric vehicles (EVs), and heat pumps (HPs) presents significant challenges for low-voltage (LV) distribution networks, requiring advanced planning methodologies to ensure grid reliability and cost-effectiveness. However, existing studies primarily focus on individual network simulations, which are computationally intensive and lack scalability. Moreover, most research relies on synthetic network models rather than real-world distribution system operator (DSO) data, limiting practical applicability. This study addresses these gaps by developing a Reference Network Model (RNM) tailored to the Slovenian LV distribution system. The first objective is to establish reference radial network models based on real DSO data, enabling simulation generalization across the entire distribution network. Using k-medoids clustering, LV networks are categorized into representative groups, facilitating efficient analysis without exhaustive individual network simulations. The second objective is to develop a generalization methodology that extrapolates simulation results from reference networks to the entire LV distribution system. Unlike conventional RNM applications, this approach integrates real-world Slovenian DSO data and incorporates scenario-based reinforcement planning to address the evolving impact of DERs, EVs, and HPs. A key result is cost-benefit analysis, which evaluates investment requirements and operational savings, offering insights for policymakers and DSOs to optimize network planning. Simulation results indicate that most required reinforcements will focus on LV line upgrades, particularly in regions with long feeders and high demand growth. The findings demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly reduces computational burdens while maintaining high accuracy in predicting network reinforcement needs, making it a scalable and practical tool for long-term distribution system planning.

J	Voronin, V; Nepsha, F; Ilyushin, P				Voronin, Vyacheslav; Nepsha, Fedor; Ilyushin, Pavel			A Demand Factor Analysis for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								This paper investigates the factors influencing the power consumption of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and develops a methodology for determining the design electrical loads of EV charging stations (EVCSs). A comprehensive review of existing research on demand factor (DF) calculations for EVCSs is presented, highlighting discrepancies in current approaches and identifying key influencing factors. To address these gaps, a simulation model was developed in Python 3.11.9, generating minute-by-minute power consumption profiles based on EVCS parameters, EV fleet characteristics, and charging behavior patterns. In contrast with state-of-the-art methods that often provide limited reference values or scenario-specific analyses, this study quantifies the influence of key factors and demonstrates that the average number of daily charging sessions, EVCS power rating, and the number of charging ports are the most significant determinants of DF. For instance, increasing the number of sessions from 0.5 to 4 per day raises DF by 2.4 times, while higher EVCS power ratings reduce DF by 32-56%. This study proposes a practical generalized algorithm for calculating DF homogeneous and heterogeneous EVCS groups. The proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy (MAPE = 6.01%, R2 = 0.987) compared with existing SOTA approaches, which, when applied to our dataset, yielded significantly higher errors (MAPE of 50.36-67.72%). The derived expressions enable efficient planning of distribution networks, minimizing overestimation of design loads and associated infrastructure costs. This work contributes to the field by quantifying the impact of behavioral and technical factors on EVCS power consumption, offering a robust tool for grid planners and policymakers to optimize EV charging infrastructure deployment.

J	Alharbi, W; Almutairi, A				Alharbi, Walied; Almutairi, Abdulaziz			Planning Flexibility With Non-Deferrable Loads Considering Distribution Grid Limitations	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Non-deferrable loads equipped with distributed energy resources, such as solar photovoltaic generation and energy storage, can offer a wide range of benefits to the power system, including load leveling, hedging against forecast uncertainty, and ancillary services. This paper presents a techno-economic approach to optimally equip a flexible energy resource, namely a battery energy storage system (BESS), with non-deferrable loads for capacity enhancement of a distribution grid. The proposed approach is generic in applicability, and includes two different optimization mathematical models. The first model quantifies the needed flexibility with non-deferrable loads, based on a consideration of distribution grid limitations, while the second model determines the optimal flexibility amount associated with non-deferrable loads considering investor profitability. Thereafter, a distribution operations model is developed to evaluate the impact of non-deferrable loads, equipped with an optimal size of BESS, on the distribution system loading capacity. An example of non-deferrable loads considered in this paper is that of the rapid charging loads of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that cannot be controlled or shifted due to the short stay of PEVs at a charging facility. Hence, a probabilistic model for PEV rapid charging loads is first developed. Case studies and simulation findings, considering a 32-bus distribution system, demonstrate that the proposed approach helps reduces the impact of non-deferrable loads on a distribution system and enhances the system power margin, which defers the need for system upgrades.

J	Fokui, WST; Saulo, MJ; Ngoo, L				Tounsi Fokui, Willy Stephen; Saulo, Michael J.; Ngoo, Livingstone			Optimal Placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in a Distribution Network With Randomly Distributed Rooftop Photovoltaic Systems	IEEE ACCESS				Article								The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) in today's transport sector is gradually leading to the phasing out of petroleum-based vehicles. However, the rapid deployment of EVs largely depends on the coordinated and fast expansion of EV charging stations (EVCSs). The integration of EVCSs in the modern distribution network characterized by increased penetration of randomly distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems is challenging as they can lead to excessive power losses and voltage deviations beyond acceptable limits. In this paper, a hybrid bacterial foraging optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization (BFOA-PSO) technique is proposed for the optimal placement of EVCSs into the distribution network with high penetration of randomly distributed rooftop PV systems. The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective problem minimizing active and reactive power losses, average voltage deviation index, and maximizing voltage stability index. The IEEE 69 node distribution network is used as the case network. The simulation is done using MATLAB to integrate the EVCSs in five cases of randomly sized and placed PV systems in the distribution network. For all five cases, a minimal increase in power losses is recorded with minor changes in the voltage deviation and stability indices due to the placement of the EVCSs. But for the voltages of nodes 29 to 48, the other node voltages remain unchanged upon placement of the EVCSs. The largest increase in power losses due to the EVCSs being brought into the network with PVs was noticed in case 3 (from 142.27kW, and 62.90kVar to 147.65kW, and 72.48kVar).

One flexible resource is demand response (DR) of the batteries of electric vehicles (EVs). In this study, we propose an electric vehicle driving simulator using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and an EV demand response evaluation model. The former is a highly versatile EV driving simulator that can produce a random driving pattern based on actual EV fleet data, taking into account various features. The latter is a residential DR evaluation model that minimizes a household electricity bill based on the simulated fleet data and enables realistic DR operation using three processes: forecasting, planning, and operation. The contribution of this paper is to enable evaluation of realistic EV battery value in various housing and EV utilization combinations. We found that the EV battery control provides an economic benefit of US$62 (5% of the night-charging case cost) with only charge control and US$370 (31%) with charge and discharge control, as the average expected value based on our assumption of evaluation. Because 40-kWh EV batteries have a sufficiently large capacity to store surplus power from a rooftop PV, they can be operated by determining the operation schedule based on a fixed-fee structure without forecasting or planning.

J	Kaur, P; Kaur, S				Kaur, Prabhleen; Kaur, Sandeep			Optimization of Probabilistic EV Fleet Integration in Unbalanced Distribution System	SMART GRIDS AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY				Article								Electrification of the transportation sector through electric vehicles (EVs) is promoted by environmentalists and government agencies in order to encourage sustainable growth. EVs as a random load may take a toll on the stability and reliability of the power system. However, they can also help to improve the grid performance if operated in coordination with the load profile. In this paper, the impact of EV fleet integration in the unbalanced distribution network has been observed. A probabilistic EV model for charging and discharging of EVs is proposed, in which both the arrival and departure time of EVs is modelled as a normal distribution and the distance travelled is modelled as a lognormal distribution taking into account the spatial temporal features of EV charging. The charging-discharging schedule of EVs is optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the aim of obtaining a flattened load profile. The developed algorithm was tested on IEEE 13-bus unbalanced test distribution network, and the results show that the optimized EV integration has resulted in flattening the load profile (gap between maximum and minimum demand reduced to similar to 18 kW), improvement in the voltage profile and reduction in the network unbalance as depicted by the decrease in the maximum neutral current drawn (similar to 28%). The proposed model can be implemented for practical distribution system planning and can be an effective tool in balancing the unbalanced network in the era of rapidly increasing EVs in the real-time distribution system.

This study investigates uncoordinated and coordinated charging control strategies of electric vehicle fleets (EVFs) in network -constrained multi-energy systems (NMES). A mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model is presented to capture the nonlinearities in EVFs battery degradation cost, power flow equations of the electric distribution system (EDS) and natural gas network (NGN). To deal with uncertain renewable energy production, a Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework is applied. Moreover, the behavioral uncertainties in EVFs' traveled distance and arrival/departure times are also taken into account. The model is implemented on two different NMES sizes (one small and one large benchmark systems) to assess the models functionality and scalability in real-world applications. The outcomes illustrate how smart and uncoordinated EVF charging strategies can impact each of these networks, while the proposed DRO model leads a conservative estimation over the probability distribution functions of renewable energy production. Most notably, using the smart charging strategy led to 50.55% reduction in the operational costs of the small test system and 27.83% for the large test system. Furthermore, despite the lowered risk and heightened reliability, the application with DRO model showed 23.67% and 5.88% higher cost for the small and large systems, respectively.

J	Wang, Y; Li, J				Wang, Yang; Li, Ji			Optimizing multi-energy systems with enhanced robust planning for cost-effective and reliable operation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								This paper introduces a comprehensive and resilient multi-energy system (MES) designed for independent planning and real-time implementation. A robust daily coordinated planning model is proposed, incorporating adjustable optimization with fundamental operational and uncertainty constraints. The model integrates various energy sources and systems, including photovoltaics, wind turbines, combined heat and power (CHP) units, energy storage system (ESS), electric vehicle (EV), electric boilers, and power-to-gas (P2G) facilities, to manage electricity, natural gas, and heat demands. The objective is to minimize MES operational costs while meeting electricity and heat requirements, considering renewable energy uncertainties. It includes the development of a two-stage flexible robust optimization model that accounts for energy equilibrium, capacity constraints, and demand response mechanisms. The model incorporates price-based demand response with both switchable and interruptible loads, enhancing system controllability and flexibility. Additionally, a scenario generation and reduction technique based on the Kantorovich distance is employed to effectively manage forecast errors and uncertainties. A novel modified Slime Mold Algorithm (SMA) is utilized to solve the optimization problem, demonstrating superior convergence and computational efficiency compared to traditional meta-heuristics. The slime mold algorithm is further enhanced with chaos theory, using a sine map to introduce dynamic exploration capabilities. The findings indicate that the proposed multi-energy system model effectively balances electricity, natural gas, and heat loads while accommodating renewable energy fluctuations. The enhanced slime mold algorithm provides optimal solutions swiftly, ensuring reliable and cost-effective multi-energy system operation.

According to the characteristics of the various adjustable resources in the network, they are divided into day-ahead and intraday optimizations. The optimization process in the day-ahead stage uses the NSDBO to create a discrete equipment scheduling plan. The optimization process in the intraday stage combines the discrete equipment scheduling plan with the MPC to create the scheduling plan for photovoltaics, energy storage, and vehicle charging stations. Two-stage optimization scheduling is achieved with the lowest discrete equipment regulation cost and minimization of network loss and node voltage deviation penalty cost as the optimization goal. The feasibility of this method for coordinating various resources in the network, processing discrete and continuous variables, and coping with the volatility and uncertainty of high-proportion distributed resources is verified through case analysis. The effectiveness of this method in improving the security and economy of distribution networks is demonstrated. The superiority of the solution speed and quality is also confirmed.

Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure, Standards, Types, and Its Impact on Grid: A Review	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS				Article; Early Access								The growth of EV penetration brings numerous benefits in economic and environmental aspects, but it also presents deployment opportunities and challenges of EV charging stations. The EV owners benefit from lower fuel and operating expenses compared to ICE vehicles because of higher efficiency of electric motors reaching it as high as 60-70%. The electric vehicles are intermittent load to the grid since the number of users charging the electric vehicle at different charging station at different time. Moreover, the increasing EV penetration leads to the increase in load requirement on charging stations and will place a heavier load on the grid, necessitating the exploration of alternative resources. So, it significantly effects on power quality of the distribution grid. This charging requirement needs to be effectively managed to ensure uninterrupted energy supply for charging EVs batteries. By employing a basic charging plan, the estimated system cost per vehicle per year in Denmark is $263. Implementation of smart charging, the system cost decreases to $36 per vehicle per year, resulting in substantial savings of $227 per vehicle per year. Controlled charging methods also effectively reduce system costs by 50% and decrease peak demand. An EV fleet has the potential for cost savings in the power system, amounting to $200-$300 per year per vehicle. The aim of the review is to address the impact on power quality of the distribution grid and study the nature of EV unbalanced loads in order to minimize impact on grid efficiently by managing the resources.

This paper aimed to present a model from the ISO point of view for using demand-side resources as flexible resources that are aggregated as a demand-side provider (DSP). The DSP consists of demand response aggregator as grid backup and energy storage systems plus plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) parking lot aggregators as fast reserve. In this regard, a two-stage stochastic programming model has been presented for energy and reserve determination in the unit commitment problem in the form of mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In this study, the incentive-based model of the capacity market program has been employed to achieve a certain level of demand-side response. Meanwhile, the Weibull probability distribution function and truncated Gaussian distribution have been applied to generate wind speed scenarios and model the uncertainties of PEVs' behavior, respectively. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the simultaneous scheduling of energy sources and demand-side aggregators for energy supply as well as reserve has led to the reduction of wind energy uncertainty and improved system operational conditions. Also, increase in the number of PEVs present in the parking lot, in addition to reducing the operation costs, leads to increased grid reserve level as well as considerable reduction of wind power spillage.

O.; El-Shatshat, Ramadan			Graph-based solution for smart grid real-time operation and control	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				Article								Under the envisioned smart grid paradigm, there is an increasing demand for a fast, accurate, and efficient power flow solution for distribution system operation and control. Various solution techniques have been proposed, each with its own unique formulation, solution methodology, advantages, and drawbacks. Motivated by challenges associated with the integration of renewable distributed energy resources and electric vehicles into distribution systems and further by the speed and convergence limitations of existing tools, this paper presents a novel graph-based power flow solution for smart grid's real-time operation and control, named Flow-AugmentationPF algorithm. The proposed method formulates a power flow problem as a network-flow problem and solves it by using a maximum-flow algorithm, inspired by the push-relabel max-flow technique. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested and validated using several benchmark networks of different sizes, topologies, and parameters and compared against the most commonly used solution techniques and commercial software packages, namely PSS/E and PSCAD. The proposed formulation is simple, accurate, fast, yet computationally efficient, as it is based on matrix-vector multiplication, and is also scalable, considering the formulation works as a graph-based method, which, inherently, allows for parallel computation for added computational speed. This article presents a versatile graph-based method for power system operation and control. The proposed method is suitable for real-time smart grid operation with high supply-demand variability. This method is simple, efficient, and fast in comparison with existing methods. image	[Mohamed, Ayman M.

J	Hussain, A; Musilek, P				Hussain, Akhtar; Musilek, Petr			Fairness and Utilitarianism in Allocating Energy to EVs During Power Contingencies Using Modified Division Rules	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY				Article								In order to maximize utilitarianism and fairness in allocating energy to electric vehicles (EVs) during outages, this study proposes an optimization method based on modified division rules. The idea of essential energy demand is introduced in this paper to maximize the number of EVs that are served during power contingencies. For EVs carrying out the time-critical task(s), the essential energy demand is defined as the amount of energy required by EVs to accomplish their upcoming task(s). For EVs carrying out delay-tolerant tasks, it is defined as the amount of energy required by EVs to travel to a nearby healthy charging station. To this end, an EV ranking mechanism is devised considering the full and essential energy demands along with the urgency of EVs. Subsequently, EVs with higher ranks are prioritized during energy allocation. The performance of the proposed method is compared with four existing division rules, i.e., proportional, constrained equal awards, constrained equal losses, and sequential priority rules. A utilitarianism index is proposed to analyze the performance of these methods and fairness is evaluated using existing indices, such as Jain's fairness index and cost of fairness index. The proposed method has outperformed existing division rules in both utilitarianism and fairness for the essential energy demand. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of uncertain parameters such as EV fleet size, available/required energy, and weight factors is carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed method under various conditions.

This exacerbates the difficulty of congestion management of microgrids in comparison with conventional power systems. In addition to intermittent generation of renewable resources, some other factors such as load forecasting errors and forced outage of generating units can lead to real-time congestion (RTC) in a microgrid. To implement real-time congestion management (RTCM), some approaches can be employed by the microgrid central controller (MGCC) including network reconfiguration using remote control switches, generation and up-grid power rescheduling and load shedding. In this paper, a two-stage programming model is proposed to find the optimal solution of RCTM under different temperature conditions. Therefore, following an unexpected condition and the occurrence of congestion, at the first stage, MGCC implements reconfiguration as the lowest-cost approach to mitigate RTC. Soccer league algorithm is employed in first stage to find the optimal network topology. Subsequently, based on the obtained results from the first stage, a programming model is applied at the second stage to completely eliminate the RTC. The proposed model minimizes a weighted objective function which includes the generation and up-grid rescheduling cost, load shedding cost and congestion clearing time. To improve the operational planning in unexpected conditions, the allowable congestion clearing time is determined based on multi-level thermal rate due to temperature conditions. The numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.

Here, an innovative scenario-based energy hub energy management system (EH-EMS) is proposed for simultaneous cost and emission reduction considering the abovementioned uncertainties. Moreover, a multi objective hybrid heuristic algorithm, the so-called hBES-MOGWO, is introduced for solving the proposed EH-EMS, which is a combination of bald eagle search (BES) and multi objective gray wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithms. The proposed EH consists of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), boiler, heat storage (HS),combined heat and power (CHP) and multi-carrier energy storage technology such as power to gas (PtG) technology, electric vehicles and heat storages. Flexible loads are also taken into account for reducing cost and emission by participation in demand response programs (DRPs). The optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hBES-MOGWO algorithm. The simulation results illustrated that the total cost of EH-EMS can be effectively reduced by installing energy storage systems and implementing DRPs. The results emphasize that considering uncertainties can lead to increase the operating costs and emission, while flexible loads participation in DRPs and PtG can reduce the aforementioned ones. In this manuscript, an innovative 24 h scenario-based energy hub energy management system is proposed for cost and emission reduction in case of uncertainties.

R.; Uehara, Akie; Senjyu, Tomonobu			Enhancing Smart Microgrid Resilience and Virtual Power Plant Profitability Through Hybrid IGWO-PSO Optimization With a Three-Phase Bidding Strategy	IEEE ACCESS				Article								The increasing energy demand and rising fossil fuel prices are accelerating the transition to renewable energy, supported by government initiatives due to their environmental and economic advantages. However, challenges such as limited capacity and stability constraints hinder the widespread adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs). Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) enhance market participation by aggregating DERs, while electric vehicles (EVs) contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing emissions. Additionally, integrating distribution static compensators (DSTATCOMs) within VPPs improves microgrid stability and reactive power support. This study proposes a two-stage optimization approach to enhance network resilience and VPP profitability in a radial distribution network (RDN). The first stage focuses on minimizing resilience-related costs and energy not supplied (ENS) during natural disasters, while the second stage optimizes VPP profit using a three-phase bidding strategy, which includes the day-ahead market, real-time market, and overall market. A hybrid improved grey wolf optimization-particle swarm optimization (IGWO-PSO) algorithm is developed to solve this complex optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, IGWO-PSO is compared with other hybrid optimization algorithms. Validation on a modified IEEE 33-bus RDN confirms that the proposed model enhances VPP placement and sizing, leading to improved economic, operational, and resilience metrics. Furthermore, the model accounts for uncertainties in load demand, renewable generation, energy prices, and equipment availability, ensuring a robust and adaptable energy management strategy.

The main aim of the optimisation problem is to minimize the Cost of Electricity (COE) while satisfying the design constraints over 20-year project lifespan. Novel rule-based home energy management systems are created to investigate the optimal sizing of two system configurations: (1) SPV-EV, and (2) SPV-BSS-EV. The arrival and departure times of the EV's availability, as well as its initial state-of-charge are incorporated into the energy management system via stochastic functions. Sensitivity analyses of the feed in tariff, grid constraint, electricity demand, and available rooftop area are provided to investigate the variations of cost of electricity and capacities of SPV and BSS. From the study results, practical guidelines for grid-connected households, based on TOU energy pricing, are provided to select the optimal capacity of SPV and BSS to accommodate the existing EV. The optimisation method is general and applicable to any household owning EV; however, in this study realistic data of solar insolation and temperature as well as household electricity demand and electricity prices are implemented for South Australia. Uncertainty analysis is investigated based on 10-year real and stochastic data to prove the optimal results. It is found that the optimal configuration for a typical SA household utilising TOU pricing with an EV requires a 10-kW SPV with a 10-kWh capacity of BSS.

J	Elsayed, AA; Saxena, S; Farag, HEZ				Elsayed, Ahmed Abd Elaziz; Saxena, Shivam; Farag, Hany Essa Zidan			Optimal Design of a Planning and Contracting Framework to Enable Vehicle to Building and Grid Services via Demand Response	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION				Article								Bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) charging enables stored energy to reduce peak loads for vehicle to buildings (V2Bs) and the vehicle to grid (V2G). However, building owners investing in V2B infrastructure while generating revenue from V2G services face challenges in planning and coordinating with EV owners due to uncertainties in their schedules and profit-sharing expectations. Additionally, misaligned building and grid peak times can create conflicts between V2B and V2G goals, which may negatively impact the building electricity bill. Unlike previous studies that used a contract-free approach for aggregating V2B and V2G, resulting in inconsistent participation, this article proposes a novel planning and contracting framework that enables building owner to determine the optimal contract parameters with EV owners. These parameters include minimum participation time in DR events, minimum arrival state of charge (SoC), and permitted emergency departure hours. The framework supports V2B aggregation with on-site distributed energy resources (DERs) for DR and V2G services, ensuring transparency and fairness through shared profits and performance-based penalties, while compensating building electricity bills due to V2G activities. The framework is composed of a tri-stage optimization process that uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate EV owner profit assessments, select optimal EV candidates based on charger availability, estimate contract parameters with profit/penalty sharing, and assign contracts between power system operators (PSOs), building owners, and EV owners under multiple virtual scenarios. Simulation results validate the contract parameter assessment and its performance via a 3-day case study with real-world datasets that demonstrates net revenue generation of $ 209 for each EV owner and $ 950 for building owners during DR events with a return on investment (ROI) of 134.5% and 130.7% for the EVs and Building owners, respectively.

Minimization of Harmonic Distortion Impact Due to Large-Scale Fast Charging Station Using Modified Lightning Search Algorithm and Pareto-Fuzzy Synergistic Approach	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING				Article								The increased number of nonlinear loads in the distribution system has caused a significant impact on its power quality in the form of higher harmonic distortion. The fast charging station (FCS) is an example of a powerful nonlinear load that is currently being widely promoted with the aim of supporting the continuous usage of electric vehicles (EV). The most common and cheapest method to minimize harmonic impact is through the use of a passive filter. This paper presents an optimal sizing and placement of a passive filter design based on the numbers of FCS installed in the distribution system. The MATLAB/m-file platform is used to model the power system harmonic flow, passive filter, and FCS. The control strategy used to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) due to the large number of FCS is presented based on the selection of optimal location and the size of passive filters that will provide minimum THD and apparent power losses to the overall distribution system. A Modified Lightning Search Algorithm (MLSA) technique is applied with the aim of identifying the optimal solution. The Pareto-Fuzzy technique is used to obtain a better solution among nondominated solutions. From the result, the optimal placements and sizes of passive filter will be able to reduce the maximum THD and also the total losses in the distribution system, which is equipped with 17 FCS units. This study is useful as a guide for grid owners to control the impact of large-scale FCS deployment in the distribution system. (C) 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

In this study, the authors develop a detailed model of Li-ion batteries that considers the degradation cost associated with operation, controllable and uncontrollable charging ramps, other limits, and the operating characteristics provided by the manufactures. The Li-ion battery degradation cost is analysed using different approaches and is compared with modelling without this cost, using a quadratic degradation cost, and using a piecewise degradation cost. Furthermore, this cost is analysed using a linear cost that takes the life expectancy based on the number of cycles of the battery into account. To analyse the proposed method and other modelling approaches, the authors examine the battery model in an EM problem in an MG. This MG, which can be connected to the main grid, also uses wind and photovoltaic as generation resources, in addition to a backup generator. The EM problem is modelled as a deterministic mixed-integer linear (or quadratic) problem; the results of eleven different cases are used in the analysis of the proposed Li-ion battery model for a 24 h planning horizon.

J	Borozan, S; Strbac, G				Borozan, Stefan; Strbac, Goran			Multi-Stage Integrated Transmission and Distribution Expansion Planning Under Uncertainties With Smart Investment Options	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY				Article								The shift towards a decentralized paradigm in power systems in response to decarbonization and deregulation efforts necessitates stronger coordination between transmission and distribution operators for cost-effective operation and planning. However, long-term uncertainties in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently, as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution networks expansion planning under multi-dimensional uncertainties. Infrastructure investments are co-optimized with non-network alternatives with diverse techno-economic characteristics to support flexible planning. To manage the increased computational complexities, a machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is implemented. The case studies firstly highlight the strategic and economic advantages of the proposed multi-stage formulation, and then demonstrate the significant role and value of smart investment options in managing uncertainty. Lastly, the application of the proposed model on a study involving a 229-bus test system and 18 long-term scenarios validates its scalability and practical applicability.

The optimal number, location, capacity, and time for construction or expansion of EV parking lots have also been determined. Moreover, a method based on drivers' travel patterns is proposed to estimate the number of EVs referring to each area, in which the unscented transformation method (UTM) is used to calculate the annual growth rate of EVs. An innovative and real-time method for optimal charge and discharge scheduling of EVs is also provided, which can calculate the parking lots' demand at different times. The most important advantages of this method are its independence from iterative-based optimization algorithms and from modeling some input parameters such as the initial state of charge (SOC) and the arrival time of EVs into the parking lot as uncertain parameters. Also, a Lagrange interpolation-based method is proposed to minimize the energy consumption required for EVs to reach a parking lot. In addition, in order to prevent the reduction of parking lot operator's profit in case of non-fulfillment of the obligations of the EV owners, an approach based on paying the lost opportunity cost (LOC) is presented. Real -world data has been used for numerical studies. The results show that based on travel patterns and estimating the number of EVs available in each municipal district and using the proposed real-time scheduling method, parking lot's demand can be calculated as the main prerequisite for parking lots expansion planning. Also, the proposed method for parking selection compared to two other methods will save energy by 26.6% and 8.33%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approach increases the total parking lot operator's profit by 4.23%.

Among other cities, Uppsala in Sweden is undergoing an accelerated transition of its vehicle fleet from fossil combustion engines to electrical vehicles. To meet the requirements of the transforming mobility infrastructure, Uppsala municipality has, in collaboration with Uppsala University, built a full-scale commercial electrical vehicle parking garage equipped with a battery storage and photovoltaic system. This paper presents the current hardware topology of the parking garage, a neural network for day-ahead predictions of the parking garage's load profile, and a simulation model in MATLAB using rule-based peak shaving control. The created neural network was trained on data from 2021 and its performance was evaluated using data from 2022. The performance of the rule-based peak shaving control was evaluated using the predicted load demand and photovoltaic data collected for the parking garage. The aim of this paper is to test a prediction model and peak shaving strategy that could be implemented in practice on-site at the parking garage. The created neural network has a linear regression index of 0.61, which proved to yield a satisfying result when used in the rule-based peak shaving control with the parking garage's 60 kW/137 kWh battery system. The peak shaving model was able to reduce the highest load demand peak of 117 kW by 38.6% using the forecast of a neural network.

Two system configurations, (1) PV-EV and (2) PV-BES-EV, are investigated for optimal sizing of PV and BES by creating new rule-based home energy management systems. The uncertainties of EV availability (arrival and departure times) and its initial state of charge, when arrives home, are incorporated using stochastic functions. The effect of popular EV models in the market is investigated on the optimal sizing and electricity cost of the customers. Several sensitivity analyses are adopted based on variations in the grid constrains, retail price and feed in tariff. Uncertainty analysis is provided based on the variations of insolation, temperature, and load to approve the optimal results of the developed model. A practical guideline is presented for residential customers in a typical grid-connected household to select the optimal capacity of PV or PV-BES system considering the model of EV. While the proposed optimization model is general and can be used for various case studies, real annual data of solar insolation, temperature, household's load, electricity prices, as well as PV and BES market data are used for an Australian case study. The developed optimal sizing model is also applied to residential households in different Australian States.

J	Alghamdi, AAM; Jayaweera, D				Alghamdi, Abdullah Ali M.; Jayaweera, Dilan			Resilience of modern power distribution networks with active coordination of EVs and smart restoration	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				Article								In this modern era of cyber-physical-social systems, there is a need of dynamic coordination strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance the resilience of modern power distribution networks (MPDNs). This paper proposes a two-stage EV coordination framework for MPDN smart restoration. The first stage is to introduce a novel proactive EV prepositioning model to optimize planning prior to a rare event, and thereby enhance the MPDN survivability in its immediate aftermath. The second stage involves creating an advanced spatial-temporal EV dispatch model to maximize the number of available EVs for discharging, thereby improving the MPDN recovery after a rare event. The proposed framework also includes an information system to further enhance MPDN resilience by effectively organizing data exchange among intelligent transportation system and smart charging system, and EV users. In addition, a novel bidirectional geographic graph is proposed to optimize travel plans, covering a large penetration of EVs and considering variations in traffic conditions. The effectiveness is assessed on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder with real-world transportation and charging infrastructure. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in MPDN resilience with smart restoration strategies. The validation and sensitivity analyses evidence a significant superiority of the proposed framework. In the realm of cyber-physical-social systems, existing research lacks a comprehensive framework to optimize coordination strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) and enhance the resilience of modern power distribution networks (MPDNs). To address this gap, a two-stage EV coordination framework is proposed: The first stage focuses on proactive EV prepositioning to improve the MPDN survivability immediately after a rare event, while the second stage involves advanced spatial-temporal EV dispatching to maximize the EV availability for discharge and enhance the MPDN recovery. The framework incorporates an information system for dynamic data exchange, utilizes a novel geographic graph for optimizing EV routes, and demonstrates significant improvements in MPDN resilience through real-world evaluations on a modified IEEE 123 node test feeder.image	[Alghamdi, Abdullah Ali M.; Jayaweera, Dilan] Univ Birmingham, Sch Engn, Dept Elect Elect & Syst Engn, Birmingham, England; [Alghamdi, Abdullah Ali M.] Taibah Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Yanbu, Saudi Arabia		Alghamdi, AAM; Jayaweera, D (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Engn, Dept Elect Elect & Syst Engn, Birmingham, England.	axa1455@student.bham.ac.uk; d.jayaweera@bham.ac.uk								4	4											NOV	2023	17	21					4836	4857		10.1049/gtd2.13002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/gtd2.13002		OCT 2023										2025-12-09	
J	Yang, XM; Zhang, LD; Han, XY				Yang, Xiaomeng; Zhang, Lidong; Han, Xiangyun			Electric Vehicle Charging Load Forecasting Method Based on Improved Long Short-Term Memory Model with Particle Swarm Optimization	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								With the rapid global proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), their integration as a significant load component within power systems increasingly influences the stable operation and planning of electrical grids. However, the high uncertainty and randomness inherent in EV users' charging behaviors render accurate load forecasting a challenging task. In this context, the present study proposes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network forecasting model. By combining the global search capability of the PSO algorithm with the advantages of LSTM networks in time-series modeling, a PSO-LSTM hybrid framework optimized for seasonal variations is developed. The results confirm that the PSO-LSTM model effectively captures seasonal load variations, providing a high-precision, adaptive solution for dynamic grid scheduling and charging infrastructure planning. This model supports the optimization of power resource allocation and the enhancement of energy storage efficiency. Specifically, during winter, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is 3.896, a reduction of 6.57% compared to the LSTM model and 10.13% compared to the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. During the winter-spring transition, the MAE is 3.806, which is 6.03% lower than that of the LSTM model and 12.81% lower than that of the GRU model. In the spring, the MAE is 3.910, showing a 2.71% improvement over the LSTM model and a 7.32% reduction compared to the GRU model.

The advantages are that they include complimentary technologies with both high power and energy capabilities. HESS have the potential to be useful to the bulk power systems, for example to increase the value of energy produced by variable generation resource through enabling participation in ancillary service markets. Actualizing the benefits of HESSs requires optimizing the combined ramping capability of aggregated HESS resources. To provide quality ancillary service, source of HESSs locating at multiple sites of variable generation resource must be optimally sized and cohesively controlled. Optimizing aggregated resources can be formulated as an optimization problem. Successfully solving this problem not only requires using effective solution methods but also depends on accurately and rapidly setting the necessary parameters in the problem formula. This article proposes a novel framework with double-layer structure to solve the optimization problem of aggregating ramping capability. Program developed on the upper layer focuses on solving the optimization of aggregating ramping capability among multiple HESSs and is compatible with most existing optimization algorithms. Program on lower layer of the framework targets at optimizing the local control of a single HESS based on a thorough analytics of HESS operation strategy presented in this article. Result of local optimization is also provided to upper layer program for updating the parameters in formula of optimization problem. Real time hardware-in-the-loop test is conducted to verify the performance of the optimization framework developed. The work presented is expected to provide guidance for implementing this framework in practical operation.

J	Lee, JW; Kim, MK				Lee, Ji-Won; Kim, Mun-Kyeom			An Evolutionary Game Theory-Based Optimal Scheduling Strategy for Multiagent Distribution Network Operation Considering Voltage Management	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Distribution system operators (DSOs) have difficulty in scheduling distributed energy resources owing to the increasing power demand and penetration of renewable energy. The goal of this study is to determine the charging/discharging of PV energy-integrated energy storage system (PV-ESS), EV charging price, and demand response (DR) incentive values considering voltage management. To achieve the optimal energy operation for a distribution network, this study proposes an evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based new scheduling strategy, considering voltage management for a multi-agent system (MAS). The EGT, which is a decision-making strategy, is used by agents to cooperate and derive the best scheduling with their own behavior pattern functions to minimize the system operating cost. Photovoltaic-energy storage systems, electric vehicles charging power, and loads can perform charging/discharging scheduling, electric vehicle charging planning, and demand response participation, respectively. Under DSO supervision, a reward that stabilizes the voltage profile of the power distribution system is also implemented during the cooperation process. The proposed energy scheduling strategy combines an EGT-based decision-making with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the optimization problem and determine the payoff function through self-evolutionary improvement. The effectiveness of the EGT-PSO has been analyzed for an IEEE 33-bus distribution system, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling strategy not only achieves the most economical decision among agents but also manages the voltage profile.

J	Tayyab, M; Hauer, I; Helm, S				Tayyab, Muhammad; Hauer, Ines; Helm, Sebastian			Holistic approach for microgrid planning for e-mobility infrastructure under consideration of long-term uncertainty	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								Integrating renewable energy sources in sectors such as electricity, heat, and transportation has to be planned economically, technologically, and emission-efficient to address global environmental issues. Microgrids appear to be the solution for large-scale renewable energy integration in these sectors. The microgrid components must be optimally planned and operated to prevent high costs, technical issues, and emissions. Existing approaches for optimal microgrid planning and operation in the literature do not include a solution for e-mobility infrastructure development. Consequently, the authors provide a compact new methodology that considers the placement and the stochastic evolution of e-mobility infrastructure. In this new methodology, a retropolation approach to forecast the rise in the number of electric vehicles, a monte-carlo simulation for electric vehicle (EV) charging behaviors, a method for the definition of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) numbers based on occupancy time, and public EVCS placement based on monte-carlo simulation have been developed. A deterministic optimization strategy for the planning and operation of microgrids is created using the abovementioned methodologies, which additionally consider technical power system issues. As the future development of e-mobility infrastructure has high associated uncertainties, a new stochastic method referred to as the information gap decision method (IGDM) is proposed. This method provides a risk-averse strategy for microgrid planning and operation by including long-term uncertainty related to e-mobility. Finally, the deterministic and stochastic methodologies are combined in a novel holistic approach for microgrid design and operation in terms of cost, emission, and robustness.The proposed method has been tested in a new settlement area in Magdeburg, Germany, under three different EV development scenarios (negative, trend, and positive). EVs are expected to reach 31 percent of the total number of cars in the investigated settlement area. Due to this, three public electric vehicle charging stations will be required in the 2031 trend scenario. Thus, the investigated settlement area requires a total cost of 127,029 =C. In association with possible uncertainties, the cost of the microgrid must be raised by 80 percent to gain complete robustness against long-term risks in the development of EVCS.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Location Determination of Electric Vehicles Parking Lot With Distribution System by Mexican AXOLOTL Optimization and Wild Horse Optimizer	IEEE ACCESS				Article								In this manuscript proposes a hybrid approach for locating and sizing Electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) optimally and managing the vehicle charging process. The proposed hybrid approach is to work in conjunction with Mexican Axolotl optimization (MAO) and Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO) hence it is named as MAOWHO approach. The major purposes of the proposed approach are to site and size of the electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL) and to improve the benefit of EVPL for the participation of the reserve market. In addition, power loss and voltage fluctuations occur due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EV) demand load, which is reduced by the proposed approach. To optimally determine the size of the parking lot, the MAOWHO approach is adopted. The integration of the EV and PV systems, especially in parking lots, enhances the reliability and flexibility of the electrical system at critical moments. Multiple objective optimization problems are calculated to achieve objective variables to reduce power losses, voltage fluctuations, charging and supply costs, and EV costs. The location and capacity of the RES and EV charging stations in this optimization problem are objective variables. The MAOWHO approach enhances Solar Powered Electric Vehicle Parking Lot (EVSPL) participation in various energy and ancillary service markets that includes the effects of capacity payments. Besides, the implementation of MAOWHO approach is done by the MATLAB/Simulink platform and the performance of the MAOWHO approach is compared to the existing approaches. From the simulation outcome, it concludes that the proposed approach based performance provides a profit of 880 eurocompared to other approaches like SMO, CGO, SBLA.	[Rao, Ch S. V.

Since renewable sources can grow beside the demand, the accurate prediction should consider simultaneous changes in supply and demand in the future. In this paper, a reliability-constrained transmission expansion planning (RCTEP) is proposed. It simultaneously is based on the load forecasting and renewable sources production, named the net power demand forecasting technique (NPDFT). NPDFT consists of a time series-based logistic method, which forecasts loads at planning years. RES generation forecasting forecasts the following year's generation by an estimated coefficient. RCTEP minimizes the summation of the planning, operation, and reliability cost so that it is limited to the AC optimal power flow equations, planning constraints, and reliability limitations for N - 1 contingency. Then, the stochastic programming based on the Monte Carlo Simulation and the simultaneous backward approach models the uncertainties of the load, RES power, and availability of network equipment. This problem is solved by the hybrid algorithm of grey wolf optimization and training and learning optimization algorithm to achieve the securable optimal solution with a low standard deviation. Generally, this paper contributes to predicting the net power demand, simultaneous modeling of operation, reliability, and economic indices, besides using hybrid algorithms to solve the defined problem. Finally, this strategy is implemented on the 3-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus transmission networks in MATLAB software. The numerical results confirm the capabilities of the proposed method in improving network operation and reliability indices. Higher reliability can be found for the network by defining a desirable penalty price. Also, operation indices, such as voltage profile and power loss, increase more than 10% under these conditions.

J	Alshareef, SM; Fathy, A				Alshareef, Sami M.; Fathy, Ahmed			Optimal Allocation of Fast Charging Stations on Real Power Transmission Network with Penetration of Renewable Energy Plant	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								Because of their stochastic nature, the high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) places demands on the power system that may strain network reliability. Along with increasing network voltage deviations, this can also lower the quality of the power provided. By placing EV fast charging stations (FCSs) in strategic grid locations, this issue can be resolved. Thus, this work suggests a new methodology incorporating an effective and straightforward Red-Tailed Hawk Algorithm (RTH) to identify the optimal locations and capacities for FCSs in a real Aljouf Transmission Network located in northern Saudi Arabia. Using a fitness function, this work's objective is to minimize voltage violations over a 24 h period. The merits of the suggested RTH are its high convergence rate and ability to eschew local solutions. The results obtained via the suggested RTH are contrasted with those of other approaches such as the use of a Kepler optimization algorithm (KOA), gold rush optimizer (GRO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and spider wasp optimizer (SWO). Annual substation demand, solar irradiance, and photovoltaic (PV) temperature datasets are utilized in this study to describe the demand as well as the generation profiles in the proposed real network. A principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the complexity of each dataset and to prepare them for the k-means algorithm. Then, k-means clustering is used to partition each dataset into k distinct clusters evaluated using internal and external validity indices. The values of these indices are weighted to select the best number of clusters. Moreover, a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is applied to probabilistically determine the daily profile of each data set. According to the obtained results, the proposed RTH outperformed the others, achieving the lowest fitness value of 0.134346 pu, while the GRO came in second place with a voltage deviation of 0.135646 pu. Conversely, the KOA was the worst method, achieving a fitness value of 0.148358 pu. The outcomes attained validate the suggested approach's competency in integrating FCSs into a real transmission grid by selecting their best locations and sizes.

These integrated energy systems incorporate wind and solar power, natural gas supply, and interactions with electric vehicles and the main power grid. In the optimization planning method developed, the objectives of cost-effective and low-carbon operation, the lifecycle cost of hybrid energy storage, power quality improvements, and renewable energy utilization are targeted and coordinated by using utility fusion theory. Our planning method addresses multiple energy forms-cooling, heating, electricity, natural gas, and renewable energies-which are integrated through a combined cooling, heating, and power system and a natural gas turbine. The hybrid energy storage system incorporates batteries and compressed-air energy storage systems to handle fast and slow variations in power demand, respectively. A sensitivity matrix between the output power of the energy sources and the voltage is modeled by using the power flow method in DistFlow, reflecting the improvements in power quality and the respective constraints. The method proposed is validated by simulating various typical scenarios on the modified IEEE 13-node distribution network topology. The novelty of this paper lies in its focus on the application of integrated energy systems within large buildings and its approach to hybrid energy storage system planning in multiple dimensions, including making co-location and capacity sizing decisions. Other innovative aspects include the coordination of hybrid energy storage combinations, simultaneous siting and sizing decisions, lifecycle cost calculations, and optimization for power quality enhancement. As part of these design considerations, microgrid-related technologies are integrated with cutting-edge nearly zero-energy building designs, representing a pioneering attempt within this field. Our results indicate that this multi-objective, multi-dimensional, utility fusion-based optimization method for hybrid energy storage significantly enhances the economic efficiency and quality of the operation of integrated energy systems in large-building microgrids in building-level energy distribution planning.

J	Saw, BK; Bohre, AK				Saw, Bikash Kumar; Bohre, Aashish Kumar			Sustainable Deployment of EV Charging Stations in Distribution Network Supported With Hybrid Solar-DG Integrated DSTACOM	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS				Article								The rapid development of EVs and their mobilization with great acceptance in society forced the power system to expand because of the increase in demand for power during EV charging and its uncertain charging nature. The integration of solar energy has increased to meet this increased demand. Hence, due to the inappropriate integration of Solar-based Distributed Generations, the system gets unbalanced with increased losses, voltage profile imbalance, poor fault tolerance capability, and reliability issues. Also, it is impossible to fulfill the increased reactive power demand of the Distribution Network by these DGs. Therefore, in this work, to address these issues, the appropriate planning of hybrid Solar-DG Integrated DSTATCOM in a reconfigured DN with Exponential Load Model (Exp(LM)), including EV Charging Station load impacts, is presented considering the Sustainable Development Goals: Techno-Enviro-Economic challenges. The presented work's effectiveness is established on a modernized practical 33-bus DN using APSO, GWO-PSO, TLBO, and HBA by optimizing the TEE parameters. The considered techno parameters of the DN are Active Power Loss, Reactive Power Loss, Voltage Deviation, Level of Line Fault Current, and Service Reliability, which makes up the Multiple-Objective Fitness Problem. Similarly, the economic and enviro performance parameters are the Cost for Slack Bus Generation, Cost for Fixed Capital Recovery, Cost for Energy Lost, Cost for Energy Not Supplied, Total Cost, Cost for Solar-DG Integrated DSTATCOM, Saving Cost, Pay Back Period, and Environmental Particle Emission. By addressing the TEE challenges, the three key emerging SDGs have been addressed which are SDG 7, SDG 12, and SDG 15. Hence, the planning of SID in a reconfigured DN with Exp(LM), considering EVCS load impacts by addressing the SDG concerns in a multi-objective environment, is the presented work's unique contribution and novelty.

Therefore, this paper presents security-constrained generation and transmission expansion planning (SCGTEP) according to a strategic bidding model in the energy and reserve markets. This method includes a bi-level optimization problem, where its upper level refers to the transmission company (TransCo) and generation company (GenCo) economic model. This level minimizes the difference between TransCos and GenCos costs and revenues in the energy and reserve markets subjected to allowed investment budget for transmission lines and generation units. Moreover, the lower level problem considers the energy and reserve market-clearing model based on AC security-constrained optimal power flow. In other words, this problem minimizes the summation of network operation and security costs limited to the linearized AC optimal power flow equations, reserve formulation of generation units, load shedding model due to N - 1 contingency, and linearized voltage stability constraints. In the next step, the single-level SCGTEP is achieved using the KarushKuhn-Tucker, and it is solved by the Benders decomposition approach to obtain an optimal solution at a low calculation time. This strategy includes the uncertainties of load, renewable generation power, and the availability of the network equipment, hence, scenario-based stochastic programming is used in this paper to model uncertain parameters. The proposed SCGTEP is tested on the 6-bus and 118-bus IEEE networks in the GAMS software. According to the obtained numerical results, the proposed strategy can be simultaneously improved operation and security indices about 34.5% and 100%, respectively, compared to the power flow analysis based on the optimal location of generation units and transmission lines. Also, GenCos and TransCos can clear their investment cost after 5 years with participation in the electricity market.

Over- and under-voltage problems lead to more difficulties in achieving voltage regulation. Demand response (DR) is expected to be promising and cost-effective in promoting smart grids, and hence, the utilisation of flexible resources (FRs) through DR can be helpful for distribution system voltage regulation. This study introduces a hierarchical control structure of a community energy management system (CEMS) and multiple sub-CEMSs to apply an FR-based two-stage voltage regulation technique. In the first stage, i.e. the day-ahead scheduling stage, each sub-CEMS optimises the FRs' schedules for minimising customers' electricity cost and network voltage violation times. In the second stage, i.e. the real-time operation stage, the voltage sensitivity-based FRs' shifting method is proposed to eliminate network voltage violations caused by errors of estimated day-ahead data. The proposed models and methods are verified based on a realistic distribution system in Japan, where voltage violations, customer electricity cost and a number of on-load tap changer tap operations are proved to be reduced.

J	Kopacak, N; Güldorum, HC; Erdinc, O				Kopacak, Nazmiye; Guldorum, Hilmi Cihan; Erdinc, Ozan			Implementation of a Decision-Making Approach for a Hydrogen-Based Multi-Energy System Considering EVs and FCEVs Availability	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Innovative green vehicle concepts have become increasingly prevailing in consumer purchasing habits as technology evolves. The global transition towards sustainable transportation indicates an increase in new-generation vehicles, including both fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that will take on roads in the future. This change requires new-generation stations to support electrification. This study introduced a prominent multi-energy system concept with a hydrogen refueling station. The proposed multi-energy system (MES) consists of green hydrogen production, a hydrogen refueling station for FCEVs, hydrogen injection into natural gas (NG), and a charging station for PEVs. An on-site renewable system projected at the station and a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer (PEM) to produce hydrogen for two significant consumers support MES. In addition, the MES offers the ability to conduct two-way trade with the grid if renewable energy systems are insufficient. This study develops a comprehensive multi-energy system with an economically optimized energy management model using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. The determinative datasets of vehicles are generated in a Python environment using Gauss distribution. The fleet of FCEVs and PEVs are currently available on the market. The study includes fleets of the most common models from well-known brands. The results indicate that profits increase when the storage capacity of the hydrogen tank is higher and natural gas injections are limitless. Optimization results for all cases tend to choose higher-priced natural gas injections over hydrogen refueling because of the difference in costs of refueling and injection expenses. The analyses reveal the highest hydrogen sales to the natural gas (NG) grid by consuming 2214.31 kg, generating a revenue of $ 6966, and in contrast, the lowest hydrogen sales to the natural gas grid at 1045.38 kg, resulting in a revenue of $ 3286. Regarding electricity, the highest sales represent revenue of $ 7701 and $ 2375 for distribution system consumption and electric vehicles (EV), respectively. Conversely, Cases 1 and 2 have achieved sales to EV of $ 2286 and $ 2349, respectively, but do not have any sales to distribution system consumption regarding the constraints. Overall, the optimization results show that the solution is optimal for a multi-energy system operator to achieve higher profits and that all end-user parties are satisfied.

Therefore, an optimized design of the battery is critical. On the one hand, the design of batteries based on a single battery cell leads in many cases to oversized batteries in terms of energy or power, due to the diversity of requirements of the different electric vehicles. On the other hand, the use of a custom cell for each vehicle, optimized for its particular requirements, is not economically viable. Instead, hybrid batteries, combining only two battery cell chemistries, with distinct particular strengths, such as high specific energy or high specific power, offer an opportunity to cover a wide range of vehicle battery specifications while avoiding oversizing and dispersion in the cells to be employed. This work introduces a novel hybrid battery configuration, where the interfacing between the two sets of cells is accomplished through a bidirectional multilevel neutral-point-clamped dc-dc converter. The novel topology is presented, and a suitable power converter modulation and control strategy is developed. The feasibility and benefits of such configuration are demonstrated and illustrated. Particularly, the proposed battery system allows the balancing of the State-of-Charge (SoC) of the battery modules within both the sets of battery banks, which is achieved without introducing additional power losses. The SoC balancing is simply accomplished through the regulation of the power to be extracted/delivered from/to each battery module by the power converter during regular battery discharging and charging operations. The converter features enough regulation margin to correct substantial SoC imbalances. Overall, the proposed approach enables a modular and scalable design of the energy storage system for a wide range of electric vehicles, from only two different standard battery modules and a standard power semiconductor device, while optimizing the battery size for any given battery power and energy specification. Simulation and experimental results are provided in the case of a three-level internal battery interfacing to verify the good performance of the proposed novel hybrid battery configuration, modulation, and control.

Otherwise, significant power variations on the tie-line connecting the MG to the main power grid could occur. This study introduces an innovative scheduling strategy that utilizes a data-driven approach, employing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve this smoothing effect. The strategy prioritizes the scheduling of MG's internal power devices, taking into account the stochastic charging patterns of electric vehicles. The scheduling optimization model is initially described as a Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing power fluctuations on the interconnection lines and operational costs of the MG. Subsequently, after preprocessing the historical operational data of the MG, an enhanced scheduling strategy is developed through a neural network learning process. Finally, the results from four scheduling scenarios demonstrate the significant impact of the proposed strategy. Comparisons of reward curves before and after data preprocessing underscore its importance. In contrast to optimization results from deep deterministic policy gradient, soft actor-critic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms, the superiority of the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with the addition of a priority experience replay mechanism is highlighted. This study proposes a novel scheduling strategy utilizing a data-driven approach to smooth power fluctuations, specifically employing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The strategy involves scheduling MG's internal power devices using a priority-level approach while considering the random charging patterns of private electric vehicles. The scheduling optimization models are first formulated as a Markov decision process, with the objective of minimizing tie-line power fluctuation and MG operation costs. image	[Dong, Lun; Huang, Yuan; Xu, Xiao; Liu, Junyong; Pan, Li] Sichuan Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Dong, Lun] State Grid Hubei Elect Power Co Ltd, Xiaogan Elect Power Supply Co, Xiaogan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenyuan; Hu, Weihao] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China		Xu, X (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China.	xxiao@scu.edu.cn								2	3											OCT	2024	18	20					3221	3233		10.1049/gtd2.13267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/gtd2.13267		SEP 2024										2025-12-09

This paper sought an optimal coordinated generation scheduling for day-ahead power system operation considering RESs and energy storage units. Renewable power generation, particularly, wind and photovoltaic are uncontrollable, whereas can be predicted using forecasting models. Within the proposed framework, a hyperparameter-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) regression model is employed to forecast the day-ahead weather from the historical time-series weather data. Eventually, an empirical formula is used to estimate the power conversion from the day-ahead weather forecasts for a selected PV module and wind turbine. The objective of the scheduling framework is to keep a delicate supply-demand balance at the lowest possible cost of generation while maintaining the prevailing generation and system constraints. A variance measure uncertainty handling-based grey wolf optimizer (GWO) technique is used to find the optimal day-ahead generation schedules and dispatches under RESs forecast uncertainty. The proposed generation scheduling framework is examined on the IEEE 6 and 30-bus systems. In the studied scenarios, the coordinated operation of generators can decrease the total day-ahead operating cost for the modified IEEE 6-bus system by 2.57% compared to supplying electricity generation with conventional generators alone. Likewise, the total operating cost from the coordinated operation of all generation portfolios was reduced by 6.93% from the operating cost of generation during base case simulation (supply only from dispatchable thermal units) on the modified IEEE 30-bus system. Moreover, the case studies show that coordinated generation scheduling can mitigate the RESs power variability problem, provide secure supply-demand operation, and minimize the operating cost of electricity generation.

In Austria, this development is reflected in a high number of photovoltaic grid connection applications in recent years. On the consumption side, there are changes in grid loads due to the increasing electrification of society, which is reflected, for example, in a rising number of electric vehicles. These aspects of uncertainty in generation and consumption must be considered in the planning process of distribution grids. A proper way to include uncertainty in the hosting capacity analysis of power grids are probabilistic load flow calculation methods. This paper provides an introductory overview of probabilistic load flow analysis, available calculation methods, required input parameters and the interpretation of results. This paper focuses on photovoltaics, so a correlation analysis of historical power generation measurements of spatially distributed photovoltaic power plants in Austria is presented. Furthermore, an insight into the development of Austrian photovoltaic grid connection applications from recent years is given.

Operational scheduling of a smart distribution system considering electric vehicles parking lot: A bi-level approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								In this paper, a new bi-level framework is presented for operational scheduling of a smart distribution company (SDISCO) with electric vehicle (EV) parking lot (PL) and renewable energy sources (RES), i.e., wind and photovoltaic (PV) units. In the proposed bi-level model, maximization of the profit of SDISCO is obtained in the upper-level (leader) problem by minimizing the cost of power purchased from the wholesale market due to the EV PL unique capability, i.e., PL-to-grid. The lower-level (follower) problem aims to maximize the profit of the PL owner. This model is converted to a non-linear single-level problem by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Fortuny-Amat and McCarl method is used for linearization based on auxiliary binary variables and sufficiently large constants. Moreover, uncertainties such as duration of the presence of EVs in PL, the initial state of the charge (SOC) of EVs and output power generation of wind and PV units are simultaneously considered through a set of scenarios. The SDISCO's profit is investigated in four modes: (1) without RES and with the controlled charging of EVs; (2) without RES and with smart charging/discharging of EVs; (3) with RES and with the controlled charging of EVs; (4) with RES and with smart charging/discharging of EVs. In all these modes, a price-based demand response (DR) program is considered, as well as incentive-based DR, and combined price-based DR and incentive-based DR. The presented model is tested on the IEEE 15-bus distribution system over a 24-h period. The results show that SDISCO gains more profit by using a suitable charging/discharging schedule and employing a critical peak pricing (CPP) program. Furthermore, by comparing this bi-level model with the centralized model, the effectiveness of the bi-level model is demonstrated. Also, sensitivity analyses on the number of EVs, size of RES and the percentage of customer participation in the DR program are evaluated on the optimal operation of the SDISCO.	[Sadati, S.

Electric mobility emerges as a viable and effective solution, offering cost-efficient means of transportation. However, the rise in fuel expenses, climate change, and unregulated charging of electric vehicles (EVs) have necessitated a transformative shift in the operation of smart grids. The exponential rise in EV charging requirements has the potential to adversely affect power grids, resulting in peak demand, grid overload, energy hub emissions, and possible infrastructure overburden. This study presents a predictive cost model that utilizes a hybrid search and rescue (SAR) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), denoted as the SAR-ANFIS approach. The model is designed to effectively model complex dynamic energy emission dispatch scenarios that are integrated with transient charging loads. These scenarios include peak, off-peak, electric power research institute (EPRI), and stochastic scenarios. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the cost of charging scenarios while providing policymakers with a tool to create financial budgets for forthcoming electric vehicle loads. This is achieved through the use of a fuzzy model that has the ability to predict costs. The ANFIS exhibits robust predictive capabilities owing to its aptitude for acquiring and representing intricate non-linear associations between input and output variables. The incorporation of ANFIS into a SAR algorithm results in improved predictive capacity through the optimization of the learning process, enhancement of model accuracy, and facilitation of efficient parameter tuning. The integration of ANFIS and SAR algorithms enhances predictive accuracy and robustness by leveraging the former's adaptive and learning capabilities and the latter's global search and optimization capabilities. The model considers various charging strategies and dispatch constraints within an energy hub. The attainment of the 24-hour pricing scheme is achieved by solving a minimum-cost optimization problem, which serves as the initial training data for the development of the proposed model using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy approach. The proposed approach effectively coordinates the various charging behaviours of electric vehicles, including those identified by the EPRI, as well as stochastic, peak, and off-peak charging, at the system level. The proposed methodology offers several advantages, including the facilitation of coordination among various charging scenarios for EVs and the creation of a cost prediction model that can assist policymakers in devising budgetary plans for future EV loads. One of the benefits of this technology is its capacity for autonomy, which enables vehicle owners to charge their electric vehicles in a cost-effective manner, regardless of the specific scenario they find themselves in. Furthermore, the suggested plan has the potential to mitigate the release of greenhouse gases from the power generation sector, thereby facilitating the establishment of a viable charging network that is environmentally sustainable. The present study examines the efficacy of the SAR-ANFIS approach and model on a standardized test system across a range of load profiles.

Evaluation of EV penetration level limit in distribution system applying charging and scheduling strategies	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								Traveling by electric vehicles (EVs) instead of conventional fuel cars is strongly supported by a lot of governments for the sustainable development of urban transportation. However, EVs increase the load in the distribution system which impacts the voltage stability in the distribution network. In this paper, a method for evaluation the largest EV number to be accommodated in the distribution system is proposed. First of all, a Monte Carlo charging model for electric vehicles is established. Then the EV charging schedule is determined with the TOU electricity price and the dispatch method to suppress the maximum peak load is presented. Ultimately, Considering the temporal and spatial features of EV charging, the maximum vehicle access capacity of the distribution network is calculated by the continuous power flow method. The developed method was tested in the PG&E 69-bus distribution system, and the results show that the EV penetration level evaluation method proposed is an efficient tool for the distribution system planning, as well as the voltage stability analysis with the fast increasing EVs in the distribution system.

The placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) significantly impacts the utility operator and electrical network. Inappropriately placed EVCS lead to challenges such as increased load, unbalanced generation, power losses, and reduced voltage stability. Incorporating distributed generation (DG) helps mitigate these issues by maximizing EV usage. This study focuses on optimizing EVCS and DG placement in radial distribution networks. The methodology employs a backward and forward sweep method for load flow analysis and utilizes the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine optimal EVCS and DG locations and sizes. This approach, validated on the IEEE-33 bus system, outperforms existing methods. Results indicate a 2.5 times greater power loss reduction compared to simulated annealing (SA), 1.6 times better than artificial bee colony, and parity with genetic algorithm (GA). Overall, the PSO algorithm demonstrates superior optimization effectiveness and computational efficiency, showcasing 1-2.5 times better performance than other methodologies. Employing this approach yields significantly improved results, making it a promising technique for optimizing EVCS and DG placement in distribution networks. Electric vehicles (EVs) are incorporated into the transport sector to reduce the harmful effects of fossil fuel vehicles. Here, the optimal placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and distributed energy sources (DGs) on the radial distribution network is performed using the particle swarm optimization method. For the load flow analysis, the backward and forward sweep method is used.image	[Altaf, Mishal; Yousif, Muhammad; Rashid, Mahnoor; Abbas, Nasir] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, US Pakistan Ctr Adv Studies Energy USPCAS E, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ijaz, Haris] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci SEECS, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Adnan] HITEC Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Rawalpindi, Pakistan; [Waseem, Muhammad] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Saleh, Ahmed Mohammed] Univ Aden, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Aden, Yemen; [Saleh, Ahmed Mohammed] Univ Aden, Elect Engn Dept, Aden, Yemen; [Yousif, Muhammad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, US Pakistan Ctr Adv Studies Energy USPCAS E, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan		Saleh, AM (corresponding author), Univ Aden, Elect Engn Dept, Aden, Yemen.; Yousif, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, US Pakistan Ctr Adv Studies Energy USPCAS E, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.	yousif@uspcase.nust.edu.pk; engahmedsaleh14@gmail.com								20	20											NOV	2024	18	15					3173	3187		10.1049/rpg2.12916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/rpg2.12916		DEC 2023										2025-12-09	
J	Abdi-Siab, M; Lesani, H				Abdi-Siab, Majid; Lesani, Hamid			Distribution expansion planning in the presence of plug-in electric vehicle: A bilevel optimization approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								Popularization of plug-in electric vehicles has changed the traditional strategies for distribution expansion planning problem. Therefore, considering the high penetration of electric vehicles, it is necessary to propose new models and strategies for this problem. The present study proposes a new multi-stage model to expand the distribution network based on the bilevel optimization taking the plug-in electric vehicles into account. In the upper level, whose objective function is the total annualized investment cost plus annual expected production and maintenance cost, the investment and utilization decision variables are identified. In comparison, in the lower problem, whose objective function is the cost of purchased energy from the main grid, the daily optimal scheduling is determined. By using primal-dual formulation, this bilevel optimization is recast as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. A 24-node distribution network is used to show the efficiency, tractability, and economic advantages of the proposed methodology. The results indicate that the DEP with the smart charging strategy will lead to less investment cost compared with the case in which the dumb charging strategy is utilized. In addition, the results show that the optimal solution of the proposed bilevel model is superior to the optimal solution of the model in which the smart charging problem is solved in a separate optimization problem.

While EVs offer a promising avenue for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, their uncoordinated charging behavior can strain grid infrastructure, thus creating new challenges for grid operators and EV owners equally. The uncoordinated nature of electric vehicle charging may lead to the emergence of new peak loads. Grid operators typically plan for peak demand periods and deploy resources accordingly to ensure grid stability. Uncoordinated EV charging can introduce unpredictability and variability into peak load patterns, making it more challenging for operators to manage peak loads effectively. This paper examines the implications of uncoordinated EV charging on the electric grid to address this challenge and proposes a novel dynamic optimization algorithm tailored to manage EV charging schedules efficiently, mitigating grid power peaks while ensuring user satisfaction and vehicle charging requirements. The proposed "Proof of Need" (PoN) charging algorithm aims to schedule the charging of EVs based on collected data such as the state of charge (SoC) of the EV's battery, the charger power, the number of connected vehicles per household, the end-user's preferences, and the local distribution substation's capacity. The PoN algorithm calculates a priority index for each EV and coordinates the charging of all connected EVs at all times in a way that does not exceed the maximum allocated power capacity. The algorithm was tested under different scenarios, and the results offer a comparison of the charging power demand between an uncoordinated EV charging baseline scenario and the proposed coordinated charging model, proving the efficiency of our proposed algorithm, thus reducing the charging demand by 40.8% with no impact on the overall total charging time.

To lessen the operational risk of existing distribution networks due to massive deployment of EVs, optimal planning and operation are vital as EVs elevate new charging demand. This article conducts a comprehensive study on the feasibility of integrating EVs into the existing distribution system, considering both slow and fast charging schemes. The problem is formulated as an objective function that minimizes the total price of charging incurred by the charging stations and the peak-to-average ratio. To diminish the negative impact of EVs on the node voltage in the distribution system, EVs are also modeled as a reactive power compensating device. Simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and an in-depth study is presented on the maximum feasible EV penetration to the existing system without augmentation. The problem is solved using a novel metaheuristic optimization called the water cycle algorithm. The proposed charging/discharging strategy works well and results in the housing of higher penetration of EVs in the distribution network along with a reduction in the charging price. Moreover, with the proposed coordinated strategy, the node voltage variation is found within the permissible limits.

Among many areas associated with the Internet of Things, smart grid and electric vehilces have their share of this challenge by being both producers and consumers (ie., prosumers) of big data. Electric vehicls can significantly help smart cities to become greener by reducing emissions of the transportation sector and play an important role in green smart cities. In this article, we first survey the data analytics techniques used for handling the big data of smart grid and electric vehicles. The data generated by electric vehicles come from sources that vary from sensors to trip logs. Once this vast amount of data are analyzed using big data techniques, they can be used to develop policies for siting charging stations, developing smart charging algorithms, solving energy efficiency issues, evaluating the capacity of power distribution systems to handle extra charging loads, and finally, determining the market value for the services provided by electric vehicles (i.e., vehicle-to-grid opportunities). This article provides a comprehensive overview of the data analytics landscape on the electric vehicle integration to green smart cities.

Transport sector electrification and increased popularity of EVs make researcher to search for charging stations. In this paper, a new methodology regarding electric vehicle charging spot is proposed.

The Effect of Plug-in Electric Vehicles on Harmonic Analysis of Smart Grid	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS				Article								In this paper, the effect of plug-in electric vehicles is studied on the smart distribution system with a standard IEEE 30-bus network. At first, harmonic power flow analysis is performed by Newton-Raphson method and by considering distorted substation voltage. Afterward, proper sizes of capacitors is selected by cuckoo optimization algorithm to reduce the power losses and cost and by imposing acceptable limit for total harmonic distortion and RMS voltages. It is proposed that the impact of generated current harmonics by electric vehicle battery chargers should be factored into overall load control strategies of smart appliances. This study is generalized to the different hours of a day by using daily load curve, and then optimum time for charging of electric vehicles batteries in the parking lots are determined by cuckoo optimization algorithm. The results show that injecting harmonic currents of plug-in electric vehicles causes a drop in the voltage profile and increases power loss. Moreover, charging the vehicle batteries has more impact on increasing the power losses rather than the harmonic currents effect. Also, the findings showed that the current harmonics has a great influence on increasing of THD. Finally, optimum working times of all parking lots was obtained for the utilization cost reduction.

The installation of PEV parking lots is the main requirement for using PEVs. Another requirement is the expansion of the distribution system to meet a portfolio of demands with different attributes including parking lots. In this study, an innovative framework for integration of parking lots in distribution system planning (DSP) problem is presented. The storage capability of gridable parking lots (GPLs) is used to postpone investments in distribution system expansion. To this end, first, a novel stochastic GPL allocation model is proposed in which GPLs can act as charging stations and storage elements. Then, an integrated model for DSP problem is presented considering different objectives of distribution system company and GPL owners. Finally, an efficient linearisation lemma is applied to solve the proposed DSP model. The numerical studies demonstrate the proficiency of the proposed DSP model.

This paper proposes a new optimization framework for achieving computational scalability based on the alternating directions method of multipliers, which allows for distributing the optimization process across several servers/cores. We demonstrate the performance and versatility of our framework by applying it to two relevant aggregator objectives: 1) valley filling; and 2) cost-minimal charging with grid capacity constraints. Our results show that the solving time of our approach scales linearly with the number of controlled EVs and outperforms the centralized optimization benchmark as the fleet size becomes larger.

Scattered renewable sources do not have a certain amount of production and, according to research, follow possible mathematical functions. Renewable energy sources are modeled on wind and solar production, both of which are moderately generated per hour. In this study, using, the optimal allocation problem of the electric vehicles parking lots and the optimal operation scheduling of the electric vehicles in a smart distribution network are studied as a novel optimization problem. In the proposed problem, the different factors including the technical and the economic issues are considered for achieving a realistic solution. In terms of technical issues, minimizing network losses, and minimizing voltage drop in feeders, as well as supplying all network demand are considered. Also, the total cost of the charging and discharge at the electric vehicles parking lots, and the total cost paid for purchasing power from upstream network are given as economic issues in the proposed problem. Moreover, the price-based DRP is considered due to the implementation of the demand side management program. To obtain the optimal solution, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithms (HMA) has been used. The proposed problem is simulated on the standard IEEE 69-bus. It is solved by the proposed HMA and is compared with another heuristic method. The obtained results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed problem. The obtained results show increased to an acceptable level, the voltage profile was improved and network losses were reduced. Finally, the results curves and tables show the efficiency of the proposed method.

It not only gradually realizes the coordinated control of source-grid-load-storage, but also strives to realize the multi-level coordination of the transmission network, distribution network and microgrid. Disorderly charging and discharging of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) will have a great negative impact on the distribution network, but aggregating EVs and guiding them to charge and discharge in an orderly manner will play a positive role in delaying investment in the distribution network. Therefore, it is urgent to adopt an effective scheduling control strategy for electric vehicle charging and discharging. First, a variety of indexes were set to analyze the influence of EVs access on distribution network and the correlation between the indexes. Then, by defining the EVs penetration rate and the load simultaneous rate, the charging load planning of EVs was calculated. Based on the simultaneous load rate, the regional electricity load plan was calculated, and a configuration model of distribution capacity suitable for charging loads in different regions was constructed. Finally, an optimal dispatch model for electric vehicles considering the safety of distribution network was proposed and the distribution transformer capacity allocation model was used as the optimization target constraint. Compared with most optimized dispatch models used to maximize aggregator revenues and reduce peak-to-valley differences and load fluctuations in distribution networks, this model could effectively reduce unnecessary investment while meeting regional distribution transformer needs and maintaining distribution network security. Taking the improved IEEE 34-bus systems as an example, the simulation analysis was carried out and the investment demand of distribution network under the condition of disordered and orderly charge and discharge was compared. The results show that the proposed optimal scheduling method can effectively reduce the load fluctuation of distribution network, keep the voltage offset within the allowable voltage deviation range, and can effectively delay the investment of distribution network.

Nevertheless, the development of PEVs is limited by the lack of charging facilities, which is constrained by the coupled transportation-distribution network. This paper presents a stochastic bi-level model for the optimal allocation of fast charging stations (FCSs) and distribution network expansion planning (DNEP). First, a sequential capacitated flow-capturing location-allocation model (SCFCLM) is proposed at the lower level to optimize the allocation of FCSs on the transportation network. Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) is utilized to estimate daily charging load requirements. Then, we propose an economic model for DNEP at the upper level, and the chance constrained method is employed to relax power flow constraints to address the uncertainties of loads. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the proposed planning method. The influences of the flow capturing sequence and relaxed confidence level on the PEV charging load, FCS planning strategies and DNEP schemes are analyzed.

J	Medina, GM; Castillo-Villar, KK; Abbaas, O				Medina, Gonzalo Martinez; Castillo-Villar, Krystel K.; Abbaas, Omar			Optimization Model for Electric Vehicle (EV) Fleet Charging Location Assignment	IEEE ACCESS				Article								This paper addresses a critical challenge that utility providers face as commercial electric vehicle (EV) fleets rapidly expand. Specifically, it focuses on optimizing charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles while managing constrained grid capacity. Businesses' increasing adoption of mid-size to heavy EV fleets has created a significant surge in electricity demand, often exceeding the local grid's ability to support charging at vehicles' base locations. Supply chain constraints that hinder timely infrastructure upgrades exacerbate this mismatch between demand and capacity. We present an optimization model for EV fleet charging location assignment that tackles this issue. Our approach considers multiple commercial fleet operators, each with a set of base locations for their vehicles. The model accounts for limited charging capacity at these bases and proposes strategically placing charging hubs in areas with excess grid capacity. We incorporate a flexible incentive framework into our model to encourage the use of these hubs and other non-base charging locations. The primary objective of this study is to optimize the allocation of charging resources for commercial EV fleets and to maintain grid stability in the face of rapidly growing demand. Our model integrates fleet operational constraints, grid limitations, and incentive structures to provide a comprehensive solution that benefits fleet operators and utility providers. To validate our approach, we perform a series of computational experiments based on realistic data from the city of San Antonio, TX, a major urban center in Texas. These simulations demonstrate the model's effectiveness in managing peak demand, optimizing resource utilization, and providing actionable insights for infrastructure planning.

The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces significant challenges to power distribution network stability due to their aggregated charging load in residential areas, particularly during peak electricity consumption periods. This paper proposes a method to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of EV charging demand in residential areas using geographic information points of interest (POI) data features and a decision-making model. Utilizing real historical data, probability distribution models for EV users' arrival times and charging characteristics were constructed using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The spatiotemporal characteristics of EV travel and charging behaviors were analyzed, and a comprehensive charging decision model incorporating both emergency and stochastic scenarios was developed. The model's efficacy in capturing the probability distributions of characteristic variables was validated through a case study. The results demonstrate the model's potential for accurately predicting EV charging demand, providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning and resource allocation.

J	Mehroliya, S; Arya, A				Mehroliya, Shweta; Arya, Anoop			Optimal planning of power distribution system employing electric vehicle charging stations and distributed generators using metaheuristic algorithm	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING				Article								The establishment of an electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) infrastructure plays a vital role in fostering the sustainable expansion of the electric vehicle sector. The unplanned placement of EVCS raises various technical and economic issues in the distribution network, and it can lead to increased energy losses in the distribution system. Installing EVCSs and DGs at strategically chosen positions is essential to minimize the impact of EV load on the distribution network. To address these issues, this work has proposed a whale optimization technique (WOT) for optimizing the placement and sizing of EVCS and DG. This novel approach of formulating the multi-objective problem of allocating electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, along with DGs and capacitors simultaneously improves the voltage stability, minimizes active and reactive power losses in the radial distribution system, and requires execution time. A forward-backward power flow method has been carried out for load flow calculations. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been applied on the standard IEEE-33 and 69-bus test systems and the obtained results have been compared with the other latest optimization techniques. The simulation results validate the performance and effectiveness of the Whale Optimization Technique, and it has been analyzed that the optimized sizes and allocation of EVCSs, DGs, and capacitors lead to an extensive reduction in power losses of 81.33% and 80% in the case of active power and 78.46% and 80.26% in the case of reactive power for the IEEE-33 and 69-bus test systems, respectively.

The accurate forecast of EVs charging demand enables the proposed model to optimally determine the location of common prime urban parking lots (PLs) including residential, offices, food centers, shopping malls, and public parks. By incorporating both macro- and micro-level parameters, the agents used in this framework provide significant benefits to all stakeholders, including EV owners, PL operators, PL aggregators, and distribution network operators. Furthermore, the path tracing algorithm is employed to find the nearest PL for the EVs and the probabilistic method is applied to evaluate the uncertainties of driving patterns of EV drivers and the weather conditions. The simulation has been carried out in an agent-based modeling (ABM) software called NETLOGO with the traffic and weather data of the city of Newcastle Upon Tyne, while the IEEE 33 bus system is mapped on the traffic map of the city. The findings reveal that the total charging demand of EVs is significantly higher on a sunny weekday than on a rainy weekday during peak hours, with an increase of over 150 kW. Furthermore, on weekdays higher load demand could be seen during the nighttime as opposed to weekends where the load demand usually increases during the daytime.

The integration of information and communication technology (ICT) into the electric vehicle (EV) charging process has witnessed rapid progress. Wireless communication between EVs has become commercially viable, supporting vehicle-to-sensor, vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-internet regimes. However, EVs still have limited market penetration due to charging process constraints such as charging time and the availability of charging points. This paper considers an asymmetrical nine-phase smart integrated on-board charging (OBC) system with a reduced cost, size and weight. All the propulsion components are utilized in the charging process. Both zero machine average torque production and unity power factor operation at the grid side can simultaneously be obtained during the charging process. Additionally, no hardware reconfiguration is required to allow the transition between propulsion and charging modes for this system topology. Furthermore, the proposed integrated on-board charger is completely monitored, and the charging rate is controlled through a smartphone application via internet of things (IoT) technology, thus optimizing the user experience. A 1.5 kW prototype is implemented to validate the proposed system by rewinding a three-phase induction motor (IM).

It is usually challenging to design an effective decentralized method to implement the optimal solution for the formulated constrained optimization problems due to the coupling relationship of charging behaviors on the constrained distribution network system. Alternatively, in this brief, in order to avoid possible overloading on the feeder lines, we propose a gradient projection-based decentralized method such that the step size is properly adjusted.

J	Pai, FS; Tseng, PS				Pai, Fu-Sheng; Tseng, Po-Sheng			A Control Approach Integrating Electric Vehicle Charger and Dynamic Response of Demand-Side Resource Aggregators	JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY				Article								Regardless of whether level 1, level 2, or dc fast charging, several methods are under development or available as an aftermarket option for Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). While confining the charging behavior of EVs to low-load periods is difficult, it leads to significant and uncertain load peaks and valleys in the utility power network. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for an electric vehicle charger. The proposed charging method involves power supervisory characteristics on the basis of the paradigm of a constant-current and a constant-voltage (CC-CV) charger so that the external commands from the demand-side resource aggregator in the smart grid can be executed. In the method, first, a feedback loop is included in the controller to formulate the relationship between battery voltage and charging power as a quadratic concave downward polynomial. The controlled output power at the beginning of constant voltage charging is then set to the maximum value of the quadratic polynomial because the charging power requirement near this point is closed to the highest. Hence, if the charging power is lower than the allowable maximum power, the proposed charger is determined to have followed the traditional CC-CV charging steps. On contrast, the proposed circuit launches the power control loop when the actual charging power is beyond the maximum power limitation of aggregator. The proposed charger can keep the power consumption inside an allowable range of aggregator. That is the power consumption at the EV charging sites becomes directly programmable by their aggregators. The proposed method is examined by conducting an interactive test of a remote energy management system and the proposed controller.

In this paper, a method to prevent fault risks in advance by using the flexibility of EV travel to coordinate the operation of distribution and transportation networks is proposed. Since EV travel decisions are influenced by the charging and travel time costs, adjusting charging price and travel time price can help guide behavior and enable coordinated operation of power and transportation networks. First, risk-based distribution locational marginal prices (RDLMPs) are established to restrain the distribution network risks. Second, traffic risks are formulated using origin-destination (OD) risk marginal prices (ODRMPs) considering the degree of traffic congestion fault risks. Under the guidance of the RDLMPs and ODRMPs, EV fleets optimize their travel plans to minimize overall costs, including charging and time costs. Finally, case studies verify that the proposed method can reduce the operational risks of both distribution and transportation networks.

The enhanced resiliency, efficiency and reliability offered by microgrids with distributed energy resources (DERs) have shown to be a promising alternative to the conventional grid system. Large-sized commercial customers like institutional complexes have put significant efforts to promote sustainability by establishing renewable energy systems at university campuses. This paper proposes the integration of a photovoltaic (PV) system, energy storage system (ESS) and electric vehicles (EV) at a University campus. An optimal energy management system (EMS) is proposed to optimally dispatch the energy from available energy resources. The problem is mapped in a Linear optimization problem and simulations are carried out in MATLAB. Simulation results showed that the proposed EMS ensures the continuous power supply and decreases the energy consumption cost by nearly 45%. The impact of EV as a storage tool is also observed. EVs acting as a source of energy reduced the energy cost by 45.58% and as a load by 19.33%. The impact on the cost for continuous power supply in case of a power outage is also analyzed.

However, unlike regular prosumers, EVCS operations are influenced by both the power distribution network (PDN) and the urban transportation network (UTN). In this article, we propose a three-stage approach for solving the hierarchical energy scheduling and trading problem of EVCSs. At the first stage, the day-ahead traffic assignment problem (TAP) of the transportation system is solved to determine individual EVCSs' charging load. At the second stage, EVCSs solve their profit maximization problem to determine their energy scheduling and market participation decisions. Finally, at the third stage, TEM among EVCSs is cleared by the distribution system operator (DSO). With the DSO shouldering both grid operator and market operator functions, the DSO problem is formulated as an unbalanced three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) model integrating a double-sided auction mechanism. To further improve the PDN operation, grid features, such as network reconfiguration and tap changers, are introduced into the OPF model. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is proved through case studies.

Co-optimization of charging station capacity configuration and electric vehicle charging strategy considering multiple attributes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								With the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs), the charging facilities appear to be overwhelmed, which leads to problems such as long queuing time and high charging costs for EVs. In addition, the disorderly charging of EVs will also lead to uneven benefits of charging stations (CSs) operators and high power loss in the distribution network. To solve these problems, we construct a capacity planning model for CSs with the objective of minimizing the total cost of EVs, CS operators and power grid. By solving this model, the capacity planning result of CSs could meet all given constraints even under a disorderly charging strategy. However, disorderly charging will lead to the unbalanced use of CSs, which may further cause the waste of charging resources. Therefore, we propose the fast charging strategy considering the utilization equilibrium of the CSs and slow charging strategy considering the total charging cost of EVs. By collecting travel plans and vehicle status information of EVs in advance, the intelligent transportation system (ITS) will centrally arranges the charging schedule for EVs and sets the time-sharing charging price for all CSs. Finally, compared with the disorderly charging strategy, we verify that the proposed fast charging strategies could improve the total income of CS operators, reduce power loss and balance the average queuing time of each CS and slow charging strategies could flexibly adjust the EVs charging cost and CSs charging income through IEEE 33-bus and road net 63-node coupling system.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing optimal allocation of wind power-based Distributed Generation (DG) resources in a 240- bus power distribution network with residential EV charging. As EV charging peaks in the evening, wind power- based DGs are more effective than solar-PV alternatives. The Driving Training-Based Optimization (DTBO) algorithm, with its dual-phase learning structure and dynamic adaptability, is used for the optimal DG placement. DTBO balances exploration and exploitation effectively, offering a novel, intelligent optimization approach. Its performance is validated through benchmark tests and comparisons with algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO). For case studies, wind speed data and turbine parameters are sourced from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) and manufacturer datasheets, while EV charging demand is modelled using National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) 2017 data. Three EV penetration levels are analyzed, showing reductions in network active power losses and voltage deviation of up to 45.6 % and 64.7 %, respectively. This validates the effectiveness of the proposed DTBO technique for optimal DG allocation.

In this article, EV charging load curves are obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation method. This article reduces the number of photovoltaic outputs and load scenarios by the K-means++ clustering algorithm to obtain a typical scenario set. Additionally, we propose a bi-level programming model for the coordinated DG and EVCSs planning problem. The maximisation of annual overall profit for the power supply company is taken as the objective function for the upper planning level. Then, each scenario is optimised at the lower level by using active management strategies. The improved harmonic particle swarm optimisation algorithm is used to solve the bi-level model. The validation results for the IEEE-33 node, PG&E-69 node test system and an actual regional 30-node distribution network show that the bi-level programming model proposed in this article can improve the planning capacity of DG and EVCSs, and effectively increase the annual overall profit of the power supply company, while improving environmental and social welfare, and reducing system power losses and voltage shifts.

The planning problem becomes more combinatorial when the uncertainty of PEVs is considered as well. In this paper, storage and distributed generation (DG) planning is considered as an option to deal with the problems arising from PEV uncertainty. The optimal location, capacity, and power rating of the stationary batteries, as well as the location and capacity of dispatchable DGs, are determined to minimize the cost objective function under technical constraints. Short-term scheduling and long-term planning, as optimization problems, are solved using Tabu Search and simulated annealing algorithms, respectively. Simulation results show that when connecting PEVs to the distribution network, both of the stationary battery and DG units are needed from technical and economic points of view. Moreover, the optimal penetration of stationary storage units increases if the uncertainty of PEVs is considered.

Probabilistic Analysis of Impacts on Distribution Networks due to the Connection of Diverse Models of Plug-in Electric Vehicles	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS				Article								This work analyzes impacts on distribution networks produced by the connection of diverse types of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), into a probabilistic framework. Some of the uncertainty sources are related with technical parameters of PEVs. Therefore, a review of PEVs currently available in the market is reported. Other uncertain parameters are related with the behavior of the PEV owners, for instance, the arrival and departure times to home, and the state of charge of the PEV when it is plugged to the grid. These parameters are modeled by using probability density functions, to then generate random numbers and perform Monte Carlo simulations. Each Monte Carlo simulation corresponds to the calculation of a power-flow in the analyzed network. The proposed methodology is tested on the IEEE 33-bus test distribution network, with the purpose of quantifying the influence of diversity of PEVs. The analysis is performed, specifically, for identify those transformers and lines that could be overloaded. Two scenarios of PEV penetration by 2025 and 2030 were assessed, i.e., considering that 10 and 30 percent of the residential customers will have at least one PEV, respectively. Obtained results reveal the importance of considering diversity of PEV model to conduct in a suitable manner this type of studies. The proposed methodology is expected to be useful for network planning expansion and to support the design of time of use tariffs.

Moreover, they are unable to provide online real-time decision-making under a variety of uncertain factors. To address these problems, this paper first establishes a bilevel stochastic optimization model for EV charging navigation considering various uncertainties, and then proposes an EV charging navigation method based on the hierarchical enhanced deep Q network (HEDQN) to solve the above stochastic optimization model in real-time. The proposed HEDQN contains two enhanced deep Q networks, which are utilized to optimize the charging destination and charging route path of EVs, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is simulated and validated in two urban transportation networks. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, single-layer deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and traditional hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the proposed HEDQN algorithm can effectively reduce the total charging cost of electric vehicles and realize online realtime charging navigation of electric vehicles, that shows excellent generalization ability and scalability.

The model considers investment, production and maintenance cost and identifies the substations and feeders to be built, reinforced or replaced. Owing to the increasing penetration of PEVs into the distribution network, traditional strategies to expand the network have to be updated to cope with the new uncertainties incurred by the PEVs integration. In this regard, a two-stage scenario-based strategy is presented, in which the uncertainties related to the PEVs are modelled via stochastic optimisation using Monte Carlo simulation. In the first stage, the binary decision variables (here and now decision variables) are determined, whereas in the second stage, the optimal production of substations and optimal charging of PEVs (wait and see decision variables) are identified in a day-ahead electricity market. Moreover, the daily electricity price and load volatilities have also been taken into account. The DEP problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and is solved using the efficient Benders' decomposition algorithm. The results of the case study based on a 24-node distribution system show the feasibility, tractability and effectiveness of the proposed model.

J	Archana, AN; Rajeev, T				Archana, A. N.; Rajeev, T.			A Novel Electric Vehicle Placement Index for Sustaining Power Quality in a Distribution Network: Proper Allocation of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations	IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS MAGAZINE				Article								Large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) has adverse effects on distribution network operations. Inappropriate installation of EV charging stations (EVCS) degrades the distribution network's power quality, affecting smooth functioning. This article proposes a novel strategy for properly allocating EVCS in a distribution system by analyzing the impact of power quality issues, namely harmonics and loss of life of the distribution transformer. The analysis is carried out in a standard IEEE-33 bus radial distribution system and a real-time distribution system in Kerala, India. The impact of power quality issues is highlighted by perceiving the effect of slow/moderate and fast chargers in the system under study. The results substantiate the potency of the reliability index (RI) strategy. The severity level for planning the charging station (CS) in numerous buses in the distribution network without infrastructural upgrades is determined by employing a modified novel EV placement index (EVPI (m) ). The novelty of the index lies in the fact that it incorporates all of the operational parameters with a specific focus on the power quality issues in the distribution network. The severity level of the EVPI (m) maintains the power quality without increasing the rating of the components used or any infrastructural upgrades. The sensitivity analysis results prove the robustness of the modified EVPI-based strategy. Moreover, the proposed strategy is validated using real-time experiments on a hardware-in-loop real-time simulator, OPAL-RT OP4510. The results substantiate the efficacy of the strategy and the modified index.	[Archana, A.

J	Rathore, C; Roy, R				Rathore, Chandrakant; Roy, Ranjit			Impact of wind uncertainty, plug-in-electric vehicles and demand response program on transmission network expansion planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The aim of this paper is to minimize the total cost of the system by incorporating wind power and plug-in-electric vehicles (PEVs) along with demand response (DR) program. The methodologies have proposed in contrast with the conventional algorithm in which the transmission line investment cost has been minimized without considering the dynamism of the deregulated environment. Moreover, the transmission network planning enhances the competitiveness of the power market, where more market players can participate. In this situation, the network planner has an important role in assessing the needs for transmission investments. Now-a-days practice of the network planner is to utilize more renewable power resources, PEVs and implementation of different electricity price tariffs. To achieve more benefits of PEVs and wind energy, their optimal utilization is a major concern. This paper proposes a mathematical model for solving the combined effect of PEVs and wind power integration with incentive-based DR program on static transmission network expansion planning (STNEP) problem. To solve this non-linear and non-convex problem, a nature-inspired optimization algorithm named gbest-guided artificial bee colony algorithm (GABC) is applied due to its robustness. The algorithm's performance is evaluated through modified IEEE 24-bus, Brazilian 46-bus and Colombian 93-bus system. The test results indicate that the combined effect of DR, PEVs and wind has reduced the total system cost significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bi-level planning and scheduling of electric vehicle charging stations for peak shaving and congestion management in low voltage distribution networks	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING				Article								Most existing algorithms for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) planning and scheduling of electric vehicles (EVs) do not consider the uncertain behavior of EVs and distribution networks, including the EV arrival and departure times, user driving needs, and realistic residential load and generation profiles. This paper proposes a bi-level planning and operation framework that determines the optimal locations of EVCS and scheduling of EVs to reduce peak load and network congestion in low voltage distribution networks by considering uncertain EV and distribution network behavior. Planning of EVCS is performed to minimize voltage deviations and distribution network losses. The priority-based scheduling algorithm uses the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) technology to charge the EVs during high priority periods to meet the user requirements and discharge during low or medium priority periods to reduce the peak load and thermal overloading in distribution feeders. Based on an Australian scenario, the proposed method has been tested on the IEEE low voltage test feeder. Uncoordinated scheduling of EVs is also implemented and compared with the proposed strategy. The results show that installing EVCS at the optimal locations can reduce the network losses and voltage deviations by 39.38 per cent and 15.32 per cent, respectively. It is also shown that the proposed scheduling of EVs can reduce the peak load of distribution substations and lower the network congestion without affecting the EV charging requirements. With a 55 percent penetration of EVs, the peak load and thermal overload in distribution lines are reduced by 20.53 per cent and 5.88 per cent, respectively.	[Prakash, K.; Ali, M.; Siddique, M. N.

The diminishing conventional energy resources and their adverse environmental impacts compelled the researchers and industries to move towards the nonconventional energy resources. Consequently, a drastic paradigm shift is observed in the power and transportation sectors from the traditional fossil fuel based to the renewable energy-based technologies. Considering the proliferation of electric vehicles, the energy companies have been working continuously to extend electric vehicle charging facilities. Problem. Down the line, the inclusion of electric vehicle charging stations to the electric grid upsurges the complication as charging demands are random in nature all over the grid, and in turn, an unplanned electric vehicle charging station installation may cause for the system profile degradation. Purpose To mitigate the problem, optimum allocation of the charging stations in existing power distribution system in a strategic manner is a matter of pronounced importance in maintaining the system stability and power quality. In this paper, optimum allocation of electric vehicle charging stations in IEEE 15-bus system is studied in order to minimize the highest over and under voltage deviations. Methodology. Primarily, voltage stability analysis is carried out for identification of the suitable system nodes for the integration. Voltage sensitivity indices of all the system nodes are calculated by introducing an incremental change in reactive power injection and noting down the corresponding change in node voltage for all nodes. Henceforth, dynamic load-flow analysis is performed using a fast and efficient power flow analysis technique while using particle swarm optimization method in finding the optimal locations. Results. The results obtained by the application of the mentioned techniques on IEEE 15-bus system not only give the optimum feasible locations of the electric vehicle charging stations, but also provide the maximum number of such charging stations of stipulated sizes which can be incorporated while maintaining the voltage profile. Originality. The originality of the proposed work is the development of the objective function; voltage stability analysis; power flow analysis and optimization algorithms. Practical value The proposed work demonstrates the detailed procedure of optimum electric vehicle charging station allotment. The experimental results can be used for the subsequent execution in real field.

To deal with high renewable energy penetration, it is important to improve the energy efficiency and stability of the distribution network. In this paper, the optimal configuration of a distribution network with a high proportion of new energy and electric vehicles is investigated. Firstly, based on the copula theory, the clustered new energy data are obtained by optimizing the wind and solar output scenarios. Secondly, the uncertainty of renewable energy output is fully considered in the planning stage of the distribution network. Subsequently, an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to determine the optimal capacity and location of charging stations. Finally, the IEEE 33-node distribution network is used for case analysis. Through the comparison of network loss, voltage change, and other related parameters, the advantages of shared energy storage characteristics of electric vehicles in smoothing the uncertainty of the high proportion of new energy are verified.

J	Li, YL; Dong, ZW				Li, Yingliang; Dong, Zhiwei			Coordinated optimization of source-grid-load-storage for wind power grid-connected and mobile energy storage characteristics of electric vehicles	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				Article								The rapid growth in the number of electric vehicles (EVs), driven by the 'double-carbon' target, and the impact of uncontrolled charging and discharging behaviour and discharged battery losses severely limit electric vehicles' low carbon characteristics. Existing research on systemic low-carbon emissions and electric vehicle charging and discharging issues is usually determined by considering only carbon trading markets or charging and discharging management on the source side. In this regard, a coordinated and optimized operation model that considers the participation of electric vehicle clusters in deep peaking and the source network load and storage adjustable resources is proposed. The upper layer establishes a real-time price-based demand response mechanism for the load side with the minimum net load fluctuation as the objective function; the middle layer establishes a comprehensive operation mechanism for the source and storage side that includes an orderly charging and discharging peaking compensation mechanism for electric vehicles, and a deep peaking mechanism that takes into account clean emission, and constructs an optimal operation model with the minimum comprehensive operating cost as the objective function; the lower layer establishes a distribution network loss minimization model for the network side that takes into account the orderly charging and discharging of electric vehicle as the objective function. The optimal load model with the objective function of minimizing the distribution network loss is established at the lower level. Finally, the original problem is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming problem, and the model's effectiveness is verified by setting different scenarios. The model reduces the total cost by 22.22%, improves the wind power consumption rate by 19.55%, reduces the actual carbon emission by 16.66%, and reduces the distribution network loss by 13.91% compared to the basic model. Build a coordinated operation model of source-grid, load, and storage that takes into account the mobile energy storage characteristics of electric vehicles (EVs), to improve the economy and low carbon of system operation, to reduce the network loss of distribution network operation, and to strengthen the connection between source-grid, load, and storage resources; Propose a deep peaking mechanism considering clean emissions, improve the operational flexibility of thermal power units, increase the consumption rate of new energy, and reduce unit operating costs; Propose an orderly charging and discharging peaking compensation mechanism that takes into account the cost of electric vehicle discharging losses to enhance the willingness of electric vehicle users to participate in discharging, reduce the cost of charging and discharging for vehicle owners, and assist thermal power units in peaking. image	[Li, Yingliang; Dong, Zhiwei] Xian Shiyou Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Xian, Peoples R China; [Li, Yingliang] Xian Shiyou Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Xian 710065, Peoples R China		Li, YL (corresponding author), Xian Shiyou Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Xian 710065, Peoples R China.	yingliang.li@hotmail.com								7	7											APR	2024	18	8					1528	1547		10.1049/gtd2.13105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/gtd2.13105		MAR 2024										2025-12-09	
J	Fani, H; Hashmi, MU; Deconinck, G				Fani, Hossein; Hashmi, Md Umar; Deconinck, Geert			Impact of electric vehicle charging simultaneity factor on the hosting capacity of LV feeder	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								What is the maximum charging rate that a distribution network (DN) can permit for electric vehicles (EVs)? This is the question we answer in this work by proposing a "multi-period risk-based stochastic EV hosting capacity (EV-HC) framework"that explicitly considers the EV charging profiles and implicitly the arrival and departure times. Realistic EV charging profiles are employed to generate Monte Carlo (MC) scenarios that are subsequently utilized for EV-HC calculations. The EV-HC outcomes are assessed for critical times (CT) when distribution network incidents (DNIs) such as voltage, transformer loading, and line loading limit violations are observed. The EV charging simultaneity factor (SF) is calculated for these CT instances. We quantify the impact of SF on the EV-HC for the first time. Showcasing the efficacy of the proposed EV-HC framework and analyzing the SF and CT, we perform three realistic case studies for European DNs. These case studies vary in size (small and medium-size) and geographically different network topologies, i.e., rural, urban, and semi- urban. The EV-HC is assessed based on four distinct power levels of the chargers: 2.7 kW, 3.5 kW, 7 kW, and 11 kW. The results indicate that the EV-HC of the Belgian feeder is 7 kW and 3.5 kW per single charger for the EVs with high and low daily charging energy, respectively. We also observe that either nodal voltage violation or line or transformer overload could be the dominant attribute for EV-HC calculations. Furthermore, either at peak load time or off-peak time, the simulation results show that high SF values result in DNIs. However, peak-load periods are crucial because a low SF value can limit EV-HC.

J	Fotis, G				Fotis, Georgios			An improved arithmetic method for determining the optimum placement and size of EV charging stations	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING				Article								The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) will result in a rise in electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs), which will have a significant effect on the electrical grid. One major issue is deciding where to place EVCSs in the power grid in the most optimal way. The distribution network is greatly impacted by inadequate EVCS prediction, which results in issues with frequency and voltage stability. This paper suggests an optimization method called Binary Random Dynamic Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (BRDAOA) that is applied on an IEEE 33 bus network to determine the best position for EVCSs as efficiently as possible, and the Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) was used in the analysis. Considering the system voltage, the load (actual power), and the system losses, LSF was calculated for a variety of buses. The efficacy of the suggested method is demonstrated by a final comparison of its findings with those of the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) and two additional metaheuristic algorithms. In addition to reducing line losses by 2% compared to the AOA method and 4% compared to the other two metaheuristic optimization methods, the suggested optimization approach known as BRDAOA requires less computing time than the other three methods. Finally, a reliability test was conducted to determine the best location for EVCS in the IEEE 33 BUS system.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a collaborative planning method for urban community charging facilities and distribution networks. First, based on the load density method and occupancy rate to predict the base electricity load in the community, the Bass model and charging probability are used to predict the community's electric vehicle charging load. Taking the minimum annual construction and operation costs of the community distribution network as the objective function, the power supply topology of the distribution network for a new community is optimized by using Prim and single-parent genetic algorithms. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified by using the actual community data of a certain city in China as an analysis example, and the scheme of one-time planning of the distribution network and yearly construction of charging facilities is given.

Facilitating global deployment by electric vehicles is considered as a promising pathway to greenhouse gas reduction and energy security. In order to supply the vehicles, charging stations (CS) are necessitated as inevitable requirements. Inappropriate place and size of CS cause some new technical challenges, such as voltage deviation and an increase in power loss. This paper presents optimal planning of CS in presence of capacitors (CAP) to maintain voltage and improve power loss in electrical distribution networks. Simulation is carried out on a 34-bus radial distribution network. A genetic algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem. Results demonstrate the effect of optimal planning of CS and CAP on power loss and voltage profile in electric distribution networks.

The paper presents an optimal power control and energy management strategy for Plug-In Electric Vehicle (PEV) charging stations using Wind-PV-FC-Battery renewable energy sources.

To this end, the decarbonization of the transport sector is very important in order to increase electric mobility. Electric mobility depends on the conditions of the electrical infrastructure. This research focuses on the electrical distribution network in terms of its current capacity for recharging electric vehicles, which are estimated to account for 20.7% of vehicles, which is about 4 million vehicles. This, therefore, illustrates the need to legislate to improve the electrical infrastructure for recharging electric vehicles, with the aim of deploying electric vehicles on a larger scale and, ultimately, allowing society to benefit from the advantages of this technology.

To facilitate large-scale EV applications, optimal locating and sizing of charging stations have become essential. For the investors of a charging station, economic benefit is the primary and the only objective. In this context, this work studies the siting and sizing of EV stations based on the optimal economic benefit. Benefit changes with time, location and capacity. A planning model method considering net present value (NPV) and life cycle cost (LCC) is proposed to determine the site and the size of the charging stations. The model has integrated distribution network constraint, the user constraint and the traffic flow captured constraint. Origin-destination lines and voronoi diagram are selected to calculate the traffic flow and the service region of each charging station, respectively. The quantum genetic algorithm was adopted for a better convergence of the planning model. Finally, a coupled 33-node distribution system and a 36-node transportation system are used to simulate various scenarios in the coupled networks of grid and transportation. The simulation results show that by introducing a planning model method considering NPV and LCC, the charging station economical benefits can be further improved.

However, the unpredictable nature of traffic conditions, charging prices, and waiting times at charging stations poses a significant challenge to achieving optimal EV navigation. In response to this challenge, a novel navigation system is proposed that strives to minimize both total travel time and charging costs at charging stations. The approach of this paper involves leveraging a unique methodology to determine the shortest path to the optimal charging station, which will be one of the renewable charging station, non-renewable charging station and mobile EV chargers, employing Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient route planning. The system takes into account real-time data on traffic dynamics, charging station availability, and pricing fluctuations to dynamically adjust navigation routes, ensuring that EV owners can make informed decisions on the go. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are conducted. The results demonstrate the system's ability to optimize both travel time and charging costs, providing a practical solution for EV navigation in the face of unpredictable variables. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing EV navigation under dynamic and uncertain conditions, offering practical solutions for diverse EV mobility configurations.

This paper conducts an interdisciplinary study on the coordinated planning strategy of EV charging stations in a coupled traffic-electric network. A comprehensive planning model is proposed, which determines the optimal expansion strategies for both TN and PDN, including sites and sizes of new charging stations, charging spots, TN lanes, and PDN lines. In TN, we use an unconstrained traffic assignment model (UTAM) to explicitly capture the steady-state distribution of traffic flows. In PDN, operating conditions are described by a linearized DistFlow. Moreover, EV charging demands and interdependency of TN and PDN are characterized by EV charging station location model. To retrieve a global optimal solution, an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming model with UTAM constraints is formulated for the coordinated planning model. Numerical experiments on coupled traffic-electric networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the solution method.

EV introduce new charging demands that change the traditional demand profiles and RES are characterized by their high variability. This paper presents a new multistage distribution expansion planning model where investments in distribution network assets, RES, ESS, and EV charging stations are jointly considered. The charging demand necessary for EV transportation is performed using a vehicle model based on travel patterns. The variability associated with RES along with the demand requires the incorporation of uncertainty, which is characterized through a set of scenarios. These scenarios are generated by the k-means++ clustering technique that allows keeping the correlation in the information of the uncertainty sources. The resulting stochastic program is driven by the minimization of the present value of the total expected cost including investment, maintenance, production, losses, and non-supplied energy. The associated scenario-based deterministic equivalent is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which can be solved by commercial software.

The proposed scheme is formulated in the form of three-objective optimization, which minimizes the expected operating cost of the ADN, voltage deviation function (VDF), and the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the voltage in separate objective functions. Constraints include harmonic power flow (HPA) equations, operation and power quality limits, and operation model of the IUEE. This scheme has uncertainties of load, energy price, and energy demand of EVs, which are modelled here using stochastic programming. Next, the sum of the weighted functions method as a subset of the Pareto optimization technique is adopted to extract the integrated single-objective problem. Then, Sine-Cosine Combined Algorithm (SCA) and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) are used to achieve an optimal solution. In the end, by examining the numerical results obtained from the implementation of the proposed scheme on a 69-bus ADN, the capability of the design in enhancing the economic situation, operation, and power quality of the ADN compared to network power flow studies obtained by optimal scheduling of the IUEE is confirmed.

This paper develops a coordinated expansion planning of transmission and active distribution systems via a stochastic multistage mathematical programming model. In the transmission level, in addition to lines, sitting and sizing of utility-scale battery energy storage systems and wind power plants under renewable portfolio standard policy are planned. Switchable feeders and distributed generations are decision variables in the distribution level while the impact of demand response programs as a sort of behind-the-meter technologies is accommodated as well. Expansion of electric vehicle taxi charging stations is included as a feasible option in both transmission and distribution levels. In order to deal with short-term uncertainty of load demand, renewable energy sources output power, and the charging pattern of electric vehicle taxis in each station, a chronological time-period clustering algorithm along with Monte Carlo simulation is utilized. The proposed model is tackled by means of Benders Dual Decomposition (BDD) method. The IEEE RTS test system (as the transmission system) along with four IEEE 33-node test feeders (as distribution test systems) are examined to validate effectiveness of the proposed model.

This study focuses on strategic expansion planning, incorporating the optimal placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and port numbers in an overlapped road and distribution network. It also addresses the replacement of branch conductors to prevent network overloads, along with optimal scheduling of electric vehicle (EV) loads to reduce its impact during peak loading conditions. Further, the increase in the harmonic distortion due to the increasing EVCSs and other nonlinear loads is mitigated through the optimal allocation of active power filters (APFs). Transformer derating due to harmonics is also evaluated, and the transformer rating is upgraded accordingly. For robust expansion planning, future load demand is predicted using Random Forest (RF) regression, while uncertainties in EV driving patterns are managed using the 2m-point estimation method (2m-PEM). During solution of the expansion planning problem, this paper focuses on minimizing energy losses and costs while maximizing the average happiness index (AHI) of the EV users. A multi-objective optimization framework is proposed and tested on a practical 40-bus distribution network to ensure that the network effectively accommodates future demands and enhances overall system performance.

In this sense, this work proposes a methodology to define the optimal location of EV semi-fast charging stations (CS) at a neighborhood level, through a multi-objective approach. It applies a hierarchical clustering method to define CS service zones, considering both technical and mobility aspects. Besides, it considers uncertainties related to the EV load profile to determine the CS capacity, based on the user's charging behavior. A Pareto Frontier method is deployed to support the decision-making process on CS optimal location, considering utility and EV users' preferences. The results indicate that the best CS locations for mid-term EV penetration can also fit into long-term planning, with higher EV charging demand. Thus, these locations would be good candidates for the power utility to make initial investments, regarding both planning horizons. A real distribution system case is used to demonstrate the applicability of the results.

J	Zare, P; Dejamkhooy, A; Davoudkhani, IF				Zare, Peyman; Dejamkhooy, Abdolmajid; Davoudkhani, Iraj Faraji			Efficient expansion planning of modern multi-energy distribution networks with electric vehicle charging stations: A stochastic MILP model	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								This paper presents a stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model developed to address the collaborative expansion planning of modern multi-energy distribution networks, taking into account the integration of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) in the presence of uncertainties. The model is comprehensively formulated to encompass Distributed Generation (DG) resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs), and Capacitor Banks (CBs), alongside traditional expansion options like substations and circuit construction/reinforcement. The essence of this Distribution System Expansion Planning (DSEP) problem formulation lies in its stochastic approach, featuring chance constraints to effectively manage and address uncertainties. The central objective of the model is to minimize the total investment and operational expenditures associated with the DSEP problem over a designated planning horizon. The rigorous application of optimization techniques ensures the convergence of the MILP model, thereby delivering an efficient and reliable solution. The model's effectiveness is initially assessed using an 18-bus system, followed by comprehensive testing on a larger 123- bus system to gauge its robustness. Thorough performance evaluations are conducted across various case studies, encompassing both the 18- bus and 123- bus systems, culminating in the validation of the model's resilience, scalability, and replicability. These case studies encompass deterministic and stochastic methodologies across six distinct scenarios. The numerical outcomes conclusively demonstrate that the DSEP solution, when utilizing the stochastic approach without considering EVCSs, is associated with elevated costs. However, with a strategic allocation strategy for EVCSs, noteworthy reductions in investment expenditures related to substations, lines, and overall costs are notably achieved. The incorporation of uncertainty management within the DSEP problem underscores the flexibility and adaptability intrinsic to the proposed stochastic MILP model. These attributes render it ideally suited to effectively orchestrating the expansion of multi-energy distribution networks in the presence of EVCSs, thereby enhancing its utility and relevance in addressing modern energy distribution challenges.

This paper investigates the coordinated charging of multiple EVs with the aim of reducing the charging cost, ensuring a high battery state of charge (SoC), and avoiding the transformer overload. To this end, we first formulate the EV coordinated charging problem with the above multiple objectives as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, a novel interaction model, i.e., communication neural network (CommNet) model, is adopted to realize the distributed computation of global information (namely the electricity price, the transformer load, and the total charging cost of multiple EVs). Moreover, different from the most existing works which make specific constraints on the size, the location, or the topology of the distribution network, what we need in the proposed method is only the transformer load. Besides, due to the use of long and short-term memory (LSTM) for price prediction, the proposed algorithm can flexibly deal with various uncertain price mechanisms. Finally, simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed algorithm in a residential charging area.

Remarkably, hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric vehicles can outperform battery-powered electric vehicles largely in the sense of the driving range and the refueling time. However, both of them require a better coordination of infrastructure system and renewable energy resources to achieve a significant reduction of GHG emissions. This article aims to maximize the long-term profitability for the planning model of hydrogen refueling stations, where the capacitated flow refueling location model is leveraged for maximal traffic flow coverage. Furthermore, we discuss various real-world constraints, such as traffic network constraints, distribution network constraints, hydrogen balance constraints, and energy constraints for electric vehicles, to make the planning model more practical. By considering the uncertainty of the short-term refueling demand across the city, an approach for geographically redistributing hydrogen among the stations is also presented where the minimal cost of redistribution is modeled by one-commodity pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem. A real-life case study of Western Sydney is adopted to testify the efficiency of the planning model under current and future cost levels. Finally, a numerical simulation is utilized to demonstrate the validity of the hydrogen redistribution method.

One significant responsibility of the distribution network operator (DNO) is to design and expand the distribution network periodically to accommodate the ever-increasing demand. The previous researches mainly use relaxation techniques to enhance the problem tractability, which would involve additional binary variables and incur computation burden to the optimization problem, or even worse, may lead to an intractable problem. This paper develops a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model considering various network constraints for the distribution network expansion planning under a high penetration level of EVs. The stochastic characteristics of demands are addressed through set of scenarios. A distributed biased min-consensus algorithm based approach is proposed to solve the MINLP model. Finally, comparison tests are conducted on three different scales of distribution networks to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the computation time of the proposed approach is reduced by 42.46% on average for different systems compared with that of the traditional shortest path algorithm based approach.

Regarding the implementation methodology, the proposed algorithms have been implemented using MATLAB classes that allow emulating the behaviour of a multi-agent system in which each vehicle is an agent that interacts with the platform, which is another agent. In the present work, and without loss of generality, the algorithm is applied to coordinate the charging of electric vehicles (EVs) in a distribution network in which building loads represent critical loads.

An electric vehicle charging navigation strategy that takes into account the idle rate and dynamic tariff is proposed in this paper, which improves the load characteristics and reduce traffic congestion. Firstly, the electric vehicle charging navigation model with the integration of "four networks and four flows"is established. The interaction effect between the charging demand of electric vehicle users and the information network, traffic network, power grid is analyzed. Secondly, the multi-dimensional spatial and temporal characteristics of the empty-loading ratio of the electric taxi are studied. The optimal charging period for electric vehicle users is determined by the intelligent charging navigation terminal based on real-time road condition information. The path planning is carried out with the goal of minimizing the comprehensive cost of charging time and dynamic charging cost, and the electric taxi is guided to the optimal charging station to achieve orderly charging in space. Finally, taking the coupling system of traffic network and power grid in an urban area as an example, the proposed strategy is simulated and analyzed. The results show that this strategy can effectively balance the load of each charging station, improve the load characteristics of distribution network, which can effectively divert traffic flow, alleviate traffic congestion, and improve the operating income of electric taxi.

To analyze the impact of drivers' behavior on the coupled network, and reveal the relationship between the two networks, a coupled traffic-distribution (CTD) model is proposed, in which the total traveling cost of UTN and the power service cost of PDN is minimized. In the CTD model, A stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment problem (SUE-TAP) with elastic traffic demand and discrete path selection of drivers is formulated to capture the traffic flow distribution comprised of EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs). An alternative current optimal power flow (ACOPF) model of PDN is utilized to provide the optimal charging price and scheduling plan. Besides, the SUE-TAP with nonlinear functions is difficult to solve, a novel piecewise linear approximation method is presented to deal with the nonlinear items of the SUE-TAP caused by drivers' traveling cost and traveling tendency incorporating perception. Incorporating the behavioral theory, a distributed coordination method derived from optimal condition decomposition is proposed for the coupled traffic-power network equilibrium. The proposed distributed scheme is examined using a coupled network, which consists of a 20-road UTN and a 33-bus PDN. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model and the distributed coordination method.

We present an enhanced AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) model that estimates dynamic Distribution nodal Location Marginal Costs (DLMCs) encompassing transformer degradation as a short-run network variable cost. We decompose real/reactive power DLMCs into additive marginal cost components representing respectively the costs of real/reactive power transactions at the T&D interface, real/reactive power marginal losses, voltage and ampacity congestion, and transformer degradation, capturing intertemporal coupling. Decomposition is useful in identifying sources of marginal costs and facilitating the employment of distributed AC OPF algorithms. DLMCs convey sufficient information to represent the benefit of shifting real/reactive power across time and achieve optimal Distribution Network and DER operation. We present and analyze actual distribution feeder based numerical results involving a wealth of future EV/PV adoption scenarios and illustrate the superiority of our approach relative to reasonable conventional scheduling alternatives. Overwhelming evidence from extensive numerical results supports the significant benefits of internalizing short-run marginal asset-primarily transformer-degradation.

To support the electric grid, and to anticipate those peaks, a growing interest exists for forecasting the day-ahead charging demand of electric vehicles. This paper proposes the enhancement of a state-of-the-art deep neural network to forecast the day-ahead charging demand of electric vehicles with a time resolution of 15 min. In particular, new features have been added on the neural network in order to improve the forecasting. The forecaster is applied on an important use case of a local charging site of a hospital. The results show that the mean-absolute error (MAE) and root-meansquare error (RMSE) are respectively reduced by 28.8% and 19.22% thanks to the use of calendar and weather features. The main achievement of this research is the possibility to forecast a high stochastic aggregated EV charging demand on a day-ahead horizon with a MAE lower than 1 kW.

A multi-objective planning model is developed herein for the sizing and siting of EVCSs and the expansion of a power distribution network with high wind power penetration. The objectives of the planning model are to minimise the total cost of investment and energy losses of the distribution system while maximising the total captured traffic flow. The uncertainties associated with wind power sources are considered. Additionally, the uncertainties in EV daily charging loads are also important concerns in the optimisation of the planning model. To model the EV load uncertainties, a recent scenario generation (SG) method is adopted. Further, a multi-objective optimisation tool, Multi-Objective Natural Aggregation Algorithm (MONAA), is introduced to obtain the final solutions of the planning model. The simulations based on coupled 54-node distribution network and 25-node traffic network systems are conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed model and the effectiveness of SG-based MONAA.

In this paper, a multi-stage energy management framework is proposed for smart residential communities to enhance the energy resilience in planned power outage events. The framework aggregates load shifting flexibility of the households and energy storage capability of the plug-in Electric Vehicles (EVs) in a community into virtual flexible energy resources (VFERs). It then optimizes the operation of the VFERs subjected to the ex-ante announced start and end time of the planned outage. The optimized operation plans of the VFERs are then mapped to individual controllable appliances in each household and individual EVs to determine their operation schedules via energy allocation and home energy management schemes. Numerical simulation shows compared with the methods in the literature, the proposed framework is computational efficient and highly scalable, and it can effectively minimize the disturbance of planned power outages to communities.

In order to predict the BEVs charging demand, an application that takes into account the random user's arrival time and the initial battery state of charge (SOC) was developed using the C++ programming language and the Qt toolkit. The network analysis was then carried out using the Quasi-Dynamic Simulation (QDS) toolbox in DIgSILENT PowerFactory on a typical German LV grid for a metropolitan urban area. The simulation findings indicate that the value of simultaneity factor (SF) plays an important role in identifying the most robust and weakest grid's bottlenecks. There is currently no immediate threat of electromobility pushing the parameters of the grid to their unacceptable limits; however, it is essential to examine the LV grid's bottlenecks and gradually prepare them for the ramp-up of BEVs. In the short term, the bottlenecks can be removed using conservative planning and operating principles; however, employing novel approaches will be crucial in the longer term.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a customer segmentation-based approach for optimal charger distribution to assist policymakers and distribution network operators in the early stages of EV adoption. This work comprises two main parts: representing plugin behaviors through customer segmentation and optimal charger allocation in community distribution networks. Customer segmentation is conducted using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, with EV adoption features selected based on their importance scores using regional EV availability. Primary plugin behaviors, based on Australian contexts, consider arrival time, charger preferences, driving patterns, and initial state of charge, while secondary behaviors, such as plugin intervals and energy needs, are modeled using probabilistic simulations. Utilizing secondary plugin variables, this research employs a two-stage multi-objective optimization approach to find optimal locations and sizes of community chargers in the IEEE-33 bus system coupled with a road network. The results reveal that customer plugin diversities impact charger distribution plans, highlighting the critical need for customer segmentation accounting for regional variations.

A Stochastic Program for Siting and Sizing Fast Charging Stations and Small Wind Turbines in Urban Areas	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY				Article								Small wind turbines (SWTs) are promoted to be used in urban areas to mitigate the carbon footprint and expensive upgrades expected from high penetration levels of fast charging stations (FCSs). In this paper, a planning framework is proposed to amplify the total benefit for the owners of FCSs and SWTs as well as local distribution companies (LDCs). A stochastic program is developed to site and size SWTs along with FCSs in urban and suburban areas considering their specific wind characteristics, statutory regulations, turbine clustering studies, and geographic constraints. A worthiness metric is also proposed to rank FCS candidate locations based on their attractiveness to electric-vehicle (EV) drivers. An electric distribution network is overlaid onto a geographic map of downtown Chicago to assess the introduced planning framework. Results show that new efficient SWTs in urban areas can realistically justify their own investments over the long-term, and reduce the overall system losses and support FCS loads. In the case study presented, the investments yield a present value of $15M in profit, in 20 years, with an investment of $23M-only $6M of which is capital due in year one, while the rest consists of annual operation and maintenance costs.

Virtual power plants, as a unit aggregating resources, storage, and responsive loads, can create more favorable conditions in network energy management. So, it is expected that the positive effect of the virtual power plant format on the economic and technical situation of the distribution system is far more than those of managing individual elements mentioned in the network. Consequently, the distribution network operator's economic, environmental, and technical goals are met through the concurrent administration of reactive and active power in the smart distribution network that is equipped with a flexible-sustainable virtual power plant. The system operator is accountable for reducing the weighted sum of the voltage security index, energy loss, and energy cost of the distribution network. This problem is associated with the optimal power flow formulation, which considers the environmental limits and security of voltage in the distribution network, the renewable resource operation model and flexibility in the form of a virtual power plant, and the system's flexibility constraints. Flexibility resources considered in the present study are pricebased demand response and electric vehicle parking lots. Stochastic optimization relying on the Unscented Transform assists in providing a suitable model for uncertain quantities resulting from the amount of load, electric vehicles, renewable power, and price of energy and eventually shortens the computing time and accurately computes the flexibility index. The optimal compromise solution amongst various objective functions can be found through fuzzy decisionmaking. Some innovations of this research include concurrent administration of active and reactive power in virtual power plant, concurrent modeling of economic, operational, environmental, voltage security, and flexibility indicators in the distribution network, utilization of electric vehicles, and demand response as a source of flexibility, use of Unscented transform for modeling the uncertainties corresponding to the exact calculation of flexibility. The suggested method was simulated in the IEEE 69-bus radial smart distribution system. Regarding the numerical report obtained, the optimal performance of each of the renewable generation, demand response, and parking of electric vehicles can significantly impact the economic and technical condition of the distribution network. However, the best condition was obtained when the mentioned elements were placed in the form of a virtual power plant. So, in such a situation, the energy cost is around $1862 for the said network. The lowest value for the worst security index in this network is around 0.933 p.u. Energy loss, maximum voltage drop, and peak load carrying capability are equal to 1.902 MWh, 0.047 p.u., and 5.624 MW, respectively. As a result, and based on numerical findings, the method can attain sustainable social welfare. The optimal power scheduling of sustainable systems can enhance the economic, security of voltage, and operational, conditions of the network by roughly 43 %, 26.9 %, and 47 %-62 %, respectively, compared to power flow studies. Furthermore, the ideal administration of virtual power plants enables the proposed plan to achieve 100 % flexibility. Additionally, it can substantially diminish the degree of contamination within the distribution network.

Accurate evaluation of the number of EVs penetrating the distribution network, that is, the hosting capacity (HC) of EVs, is beneficial to distribution network planning and efficient operation. Further, EVs have uncertainties in terms of arrival time, departure time, battery state of charge (SOC), and choice of charging station, which collectively affect the system difficult, but important, step of modeling EV uncertainties on system performance. This paper presents a methodology to model how many EVs can penetrate a low voltage distribution network, especially microgrid. First, EV load modeling incorporating uncertainties is performed by applying interval and affine arithmetic. Second, to analyze the effects of voltage, the same arithmetic methods are extended to perform power flow calculation. Thirdly, interval undervoltage probability (IUP) is introduced to evaluate the HC of the EVs. Subsequently, a voltage violation index (VVI) is introduced, and an EV HC evaluation method is proposed, assisting in the flexible operation of the network based on VVI. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated by modeling the network of Seoul National University in South Korea, which is subsequently compared with the conventional approach of determining EV HC. The model incorporated Seoul National University's practical cable data, load data, and vehicle access data, along with the number of EVs penetrating the target network.

J	Liu, XO				Liu, Xiaoou			Research on Flexibility Evaluation Method of Distribution System Based on Renewable Energy and Electric Vehicles	IEEE ACCESS				Article								High penetration of renewable energy brings economic and environmental benefits to the grid, but also causes challenges to the distribution system flexibility due to its uncertainty. As a new variable load, electric vehicles (EVs) can increase system's flexibility through interactions with the grid and promote the consumption of renewable energy. This paper studies the flexibility evaluation of distribution system considering the interaction between EVs and the grid. Firstly, the charging and discharging control strategies of EVs have been analyzed to reduce the impact of renewable energy output fluctuations on the distribution system flexibility, such as the G2V (Grid to vehicle) and V2G (Vehicle to grid) modes. Secondly, the battery capacity, driving plan, and transportation network are modeled to study the impact of the EVs connected to the grid on the distribution system flexibility. Thirdly, the flexibility evaluation method of distribution network is proposed based on the feasibility analysis of uncertain region. Finally, the analyses of the example show that the proposed method can realize the evaluation of the time series flexibility of the distribution system, which proves the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.

This paper employs a sequential decomposition method based on physical characteristics of the problem, breaking down the holistic problem into two sub-problems for solution. Subproblem I optimizes the charging and discharging behavior of autopilot electric vehicles (AEVs) using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Subproblem II uses a mixed-integer second- order cone programming (MISOCP) model to plan ADN and retrofit or construct V2G charging stations (V2GCS), as well as multiple distributed generation resources (DGRs). The paper also analyzes the impact of bi-directional active-reactive power interaction of V2GCS on ADN planning. The presented model is tested in the 47-node ADN in Longgang District, Shenzhen, China, and the IEEE 33-node ADN, demonstrating that decomposition can significantly improve the speed of solving large-scale problems while maintaining accuracy with low AEV penetration.

An aggregator can provide frequency regulation by controlling its generation and demand. Here we investigate the participation of an aggregator controlling a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) and an energy storage (ES) in day-ahead regulation and energy markets and determine the optimal size of the aggregator's bids. The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model, taking into account the uncertainties regarding energy and frequency regulation prices. The risks associated with the uncertainties are managed using the conditional value-at-risk method. Because most EVs are charged in residential distribution networks, load flow constraints are also taken into account. A linear formulation based on the rainflow cycle counting algorithm is proposed to include the ES degradation costs incurred from following the frequency regulation signals into the objective function. The problem is studied within the context of amedium-voltage distribution network adopting the market rules of the California Independent System Operator. The results of the numerical analysis show howjoint optimization of EVs and ES can improve the aggregator's profit, and verify that the proposed degradation cost formulation can effectively minimize the degradation costs of the ES.

A residential neighborhood of the city of Toronto, Canada, is selected to perform the study based on survey results that showed a high tendency for EV adoption. The two most loaded distribution transformers of such a neighborhood are studied along with their cable feeders via steady-state simulations in CYME software. A worst case scenario of full EV penetration is studied, where all chargers are connected to the system simultaneously at the peak summer or winter load. The effect of increasing the rate of EV adoption on the performance of distribution networks is examined with correlation to the ambient temperature. Finally, the impact of increasing the charger size on system performance is explored. The results send a few warning signals of potential equipment overload to utility companies under certain system loading and EV charging levels as EV use grows, impacting utility future planning and operation. This will assist utilities in taking appropriate measures with respect to operating the existing system and also planning for the future.

Electric vehicles (EVs) can bring up significant benefits such as mitigating the sharp fluctuations of renewables and assisting them to merge into the markets that will lead to reduce the procurement costs and carbon emissions from the transportation sector. To this end, an information gap decision theory is extended to manage the revenue risk of EV managers and harnessing the system in confronting with intense uncertainty. The proposed model can provide satisfactory solution to guarantee the predefined profit for EV managers while satisfying the requirements of distribution network. Look-ahead active and reactive powers scheduling of various EV aggregations are arranged incorporating vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) options in the daily travel route of EVs. The proposed multi-objective problem is formulated based on augmented epsilon-constraint technique, where the main objective is to maximize the profit of EV managers constrained by operating costs of system. An innovative hybrid algorithm based on GWO&PSO is developed to optimize the problem.

This work addresses the problem of controlling the charging of electric vehicles in low voltage distribution systems using an optimization framework formulated as a scheduling problem. A computationally efficient procedure with a detailed modeling of the network is sought. The objective is to obtain a charging schedule for all the EVs connected to the network satisfying a set of network operational constraints. The approach uses a complete AC three-phase modeling of the network and deploys a time-series power flow coupled with a greedy heuristic to obtain a smart charging procedure over a fixed planning period considering the variable behavior of loads and EV connection patterns. Distribution network constraints consider phase unbalance, transformer and line limitations, and node voltage limits. The approach is tested on an IEEE low voltage distribution test feeder.

Charging/discharging of EV from/to the distribution system has significant impacts on the load demand, network congestion, voltage rise/dip, and other operational issues. Power supply from distributed generators (DGs) is utilised during the peak demand hour to avoid the need for upgradation of the distribution systems. In this study, 24-hour day ahead power scheduling of PHEVs (in between arrival and departure time), distributed-battery energy storage system (D-BESS) and DGs is proposed to mitigate its effect on the distribution system. Four objective functions including system operating cost, CO2 emission, energy losses, and load flattening are considered to examine the effect of distributed sources on the 38-bus distribution system. An effective butterfly optimiser is implemented to minimise single weighted objective function. To understand individual as well as combined effect of unscheduled PHEVs charging, scheduled charging/discharging of PHEVs, D-BESS, and DGs various case studies is performed. On the basis of these case studies, optimal scheduling of PHEVs, D-BESS, and DGs are proposed to improve the overall system performance.

In this study, the effects of critical peaks (CPs) on EVs' charge/discharge process (CDP) while providing V2G services are critically investigated. A charge/discharge optimisation algorithm for EVs while considering varying charging costs and discharging incentives is proposed. Primarily, a probability model for the occurrence of CPs is formulated and incorporated in a time-of-use tariff plan. Considering the battery capacity loss in a CDP, an optimisation model is developed based on a non-linear programming model. An optimisation algorithm is proposed to enhance the EVs' CDP. The goal is to obtain the least possible charging cost per day while facilitating the V2G services, especially in case of CPs. The effects of CPs on the per day charging cost while considering real-life scenarios are investigated. Furthermore, the dependence of the energy discharged by the EV on the number of estimated battery cycle life and the per day charging cost considering battery replacement is analysed.

High penetration of EVs in the distribution network contributes to the increment of capital investment in smart grid technologies. This is because EVs' charging operation involves a considerably high level of electricity due to the size of EVs' battery charging period. Poor scheduling of EVs charging operation will lead to an increment in electricity consumption. This will then lead to overloading of distribution network, voltage quality degradation, power loss increment, and dispatch of uneconomical energy sources. Hence, coordinated, and smart charging schemes are vital in order to reduce charging costs. This paper proposes an optimized EV battery charging and discharging scheduling model using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on three charging scenarios. The daily charging and discharging schedule of EVs are optimized using optimal control. The result shows that the proposed optimized charging and discharging scheduling model reduces the charging cost up to approximately 50%.

This leads to a change in the load profile of distribution systems by altering the peak demand intervals from what is being forecast without the consideration of EVs. This necessitates a quantitative approach for determining the load profile in a scenario where the number of EVs are high. This paper addresses the planning and operation problem from the perspective of grid stability by determining the load profile of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and subsequently quantifying the impact of EVCS on the voltage profile of the distribution system. A coordinated charging strategy is used to determine the load profile of EVCS constrained by both grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) rulesets. voltage sensitivity factor (VSF) and Voltage Stability Index (VSI) were used to quantify the impact of the EVCS load profile on the distribution system. This work proposes a novel algorithm to determine the voltage stability indices given the refuel and travel patterns of EVs of a region.

Pave the way for sustainable smart homes: A reliable hybrid AC/DC electricity infrastructure	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								The development of emerging smart grid technologies has led to more and more penetration of renewable energy resources and electric energy storage in the residential sectors. Besides, owing to the significant evolution of power electronic devices, there is a rapid growth in penetration of DC loads and generations, such as PV and electric vehicles (EVs), into the buildings and homes as a building block of the future smart cities. This is despite the fact that the electricity infrastructure of the conventional buildings is designed based on AC electricity and as a result, there would be a lot of losses due to the frequent power conversion from AC to DC and vice versa. Besides, according to a significant amount of energy consumption in the residential sector, buildings have a prominent role to confront environmental problems and obtain sustainability. In such circumstances, and considering the energy outlook, rethinking the electrification structure of the built environment is necessary. This work is an effort in this regard and looks for a sustainable energy infrastructure for the cyber-physical homes of the future. Three disparate electrification architectures are analyzed. The proposed framework, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, not only considers costs associated with investment and operation but also evaluates the reliability of each structure by considering the different ratios of DC loads. Moreover, the optimal size of renewable energy resources and the effect of EV demand response, and different prices of PV and battery are precisely investigated. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated via numerical simulation.

Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can play a significant role in reducing the petrol consumption. A large amount of additional electrical power demand needed for the charging of PEVs may adversely affect the electric grid reliability. Using the charging station in the micro-grids (MGs) to minimise the total system operation cost in the presence of PEVs with vehicle to grid (V2G) capability is becoming vitally important. In this work, a practical model for charging strategy of PEVs based on typical charge and discharge profiles given by the battery producers is considered. The problem is constrained by the loss of load probability index of reliability. The proposed strategy makes it possible to handle the generation shortage due to the outage of conventional units and intermittency of wind turbine units. Mixed Integer Non-linear programming is used for the optimal planning of MG in the presence of PEVs. Results show that an appropriate charge and discharge strategy may lead to a significant improvement in the reliability of the considered MG as well as a reduction in the operational cost of the total system.

For this end, a new planning framework to facilitate efficient accommodation of PEVs via gridable parking lots (PLs) is proposed in this study. Different from most previous works, the presented method explicitly considers the potential uncertainties in the users' behaviors in the PL planning, which will allow decision-makers to better assess the effect of human factors on the efficiency of their investment. Moreover, the concerned PL allocation problem has been investigated in conjunction with the optimal contract offer for PEV users to obtain the final planning scheme. The overall problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model, where the first-stage mainly deals with the planning decisions associated with PLs, including siting and sizing of PLs and contractual arrangements; while the second stage evaluates the operational performance of the suggested PL system under different scenario realizations of PEV behaviors. A combinatorial optimization algorithm is used to solve the problem. The proposed framework is demonstrated on an illustrative testing system and numerical results verify the effectiveness of our method.

The model utilizes traffic information to evaluate the influence of traffic systems on driving and charging behavior, specifically focusing on the characteristics of EVs with transportation and mobile load. Additionally, it evaluates the effect of widespread charging on the distribution network. An urban traffic network model is constructed based on the multi-intersection features, and a traffic network-distribution network interaction model is determined according to the size of the urban road network. Type classification simplifies the charging and discharging characteristics of EVs, enabling efficient aggregation of EVs. The authors have built a singular EV transportation model and an EV charging queue model is established. The EV charging demand is forecasted and then used as an input in the support vector machine (SVM) model. The final projection value for EV charging load is determined by taking into account many influencing elements.

The presented optimal planning is done along with considering the rate of customers' participation in demand response programs (DRPs) at the presence of some uncertainties associated with the load values and electricity market price. In order to model the load, time-of-use DRP is used. The proposed model involves distribution system manager (DSM) benefit maximising derived from the appropriate use of CS for charging and discharging vehicle batteries, reliability improvement and supplying network's load demand at peak times as the objective function, technical limitation as constraint and the siting and sizing of electric vehicles CS as optimisation variables. The genetic algorithm method with embedded Monte Carlo simulation is used in order to solve the optimisation problem and is applied to the 9-bus and 33-bus networks.

J	Zhang, JY; Jing, WP; Lu, ZM; Wu, HT; Wen, XM				Zhang, Jingyi; Jing, Wenpeng; Lu, Zhaoming; Wu, Haotian; Wen, Xiangming			Collaborative strategy for electric vehicle charging scheduling and route planning	IET SMART GRID				Article								Due to varying energy demands and supply levels in different regions, the distribution of power load exhibits an imbalanced state. It contributes to increased power loss and poses a threat to the security constraints of the electrical grid. Simultaneously, the global energy transition has led to a continuous increase in the proportion of renewable energy integrated into the grid. Electric vehicles (EVs), serving as representative of renewable energy, further magnify this load imbalance with their charging requirements, which poses a significant challenge to the stable operation of the grid. Therefore, to ensure the smooth operation of the grid under the context of renewable energy integration, the authors investigate the coordinated strategies of EV charging scheduling and route planning. The authors first model the coupling of the transportation network with the smart grid as a cyber-physical system. Subsequently, the authors simulate and analyse the daily charging load curve of the network, capturing the travel characteristics of EVs. Based on this, the authors research the EV charging scheduling in both individual and collective travel scenarios during peak and off-peak hours. For the off-peak travel period of EVs, a charging schedule strategy based on travel plans is proposed, which reduces the time cost of EV owners' travel. Furthermore, for the collective travel of a large number of EVs within the system, a multi-EV charging scheduling strategy based on charging station load balancing is presented. This strategy effectively balances the load levels of various charging stations while reducing the overall system travel time. Ultimately, through experimental results, the authors demonstrate that by deploying appropriate charging scheduling strategies, EVs cease to be a burden on the grid and can be transformed into tools for balancing the loads across different regions. To ensure the smooth operation of the grid under the context of renewable energy integration, the authors investigate the coordinated strategies of electric vehicles (EVs) charging scheduling and route planning.

This paper proposes a resilient home energy management strategy to enable residential houses to implement self-power supply during a planned grid outage period. The proposed strategy utilizes the energy backup capability of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) to accommodate residential solar photovoltaic (PV) source and power the house in the presence of grid outage event.

The proposed method is also aimed at keeping the comfort and satisfaction of the EV users at a high level without the obligation of the EV owners to inform the operator of the entry and charge planning. DBS introduces a real-time energy-sharing method that uses both the grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) topologies simultaneously without knowing the power demand profile in advance. However, from the perspective of smart grid, it is also possible to activate the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) topology in case of frequency or voltage fluctuations in the network with the proposed DBS. The proposed DBS was simulated in real time and phasor analysis for different penetration levels in MATLAB/Simulink program. Considering that EV driver behavior is highly variable and will vary regionally, it is shown that the proposed DBS gives dynamic results against all behavioral situations, varying penetration levels, and all the negativities that may occur in the penetration of EVs are overcome by keeping the satisfaction of EV drivers at a high levels.

In this paper, to manage the EVCS, first, with the aim of peak shaving, valley filling, and flattening the load curve of the network, the optimal planning of EV's charging/discharging is devised. In this regard, after modeling involving random variables, a novel hybrid method, based on the Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) optimization algorithm and sequential Monte Carlo simulation is presented. The purpose of the presented optimal charge/discharge schedule is to control the rate and time of charging/discharging of EVs. In the proposed model, various battery operation strategies, including Uncontrolled Charging Mode (UCM), Controlled Charging Mode (CCM), and Smart Charge/Discharge Mode (SCDM) are also considered. In the next step, in order to implement the charge/discharge schedule of the EVCS profitably, a new formulation is presented for the allocation of two EVCSs (administrative and residential EVCS). In the proposed formulation, various objective functions such as power loss reduction, reducing power purchases from the upstream network, reducing voltage deviation in buses, improving reliability is addressed. Moreover, to incentivize the owner to construct the EVCS with adopted charging/discharging schedule, the optimal profits sharing between Distribution System Operator (DSO) and EVCS owner is also performed. The proposed formulation is applied to a standard network (IEEE 69 buses) and encouraging results are achieved.

However, previous studies have not addressed the connection between BSS recharging strategies and the demand for fully charged batteries, which is determined by EV swapping schemes. To address this gap, the paper proposes a joint optimization approach for scheduling EVs and managing BSSs, considering RE generation along the highway. Specifically, a spatial-temporal network model is developed to represent the transportation-energy characteristics of EVs, incorporating BSS selection and battery swapping processes. Additionally, a BSS management model is formulated to plan the recharging of depleted batteries and ensure the availability of fully charged batteries to meet the swapping demands of EVs. The Lagrange relaxation algorithm is employed to handle the interaction between EV scheduling and BSS operations. A case study shows that this method effectively coordinates EV swapping schemes with BSS recharging strategies, resulting in a 17.3% improvement in RE generation utilization and a reduction in grid electricity consumption by RMB 1753.8.

Therefore, this article presents a look-ahead scheduling model for EVs to offer a load curtailment service in a distribution network, with the aim of smoothing out the power fluctuations caused by distributed renewable energy sources. An equivalent aggregation method that is not sensitive to heterogeneous private parameters is used to extract the overall dynamic power regulation characteristics of the EV population, while a decomposition model ensures the completion of the regulation task. Besides, in the scheduling model, the variable baselines are dynamically refreshed to capture the load rebound effects caused by load curtailment, allowing more accurate regulation plans to be obtained. A two-stage iterative solution strategy is also adopted to obtain the approximate optimal solution. Simulations demonstrate both the accuracy of the aggregation model and the effectiveness of the scheduling model.

Real-time charging coordination of plug-in electric vehicles based on hybrid fuzzy discrete particle swarm optimization	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								The main impact of uncoordinated plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging is adding new time-variant loads that can increase the strains on the generation units, transmission and distribution systems that may result in unacceptable voltage drops and poor power quality. This paper proposes two dynamic online approaches for coordination of PEV charging based on fuzzy genetic algorithm (FGA) and fuzzy discrete particle swarm optimization (FDPSO). The algorithms will minimize the costs associated with energy generation and grid losses while also maximizing the delivered power to PEVs considering distribution transformer loading, voltage regulation limits, initial and final battery state of charges (SOCs) based on consumers' preferences. The second algorithm relies on the quality and speed of DPSO solution for more accurate and faster online coordination of PEVs while also exploiting fuzzy reasoning for shifting charging demands to off-peak hours for a further reduction in overall cost and transformer loading. Simulation results for uncoordinated, DPSO, FGA and FDPSO coordinated charging are presented and compared for a 449-node network populated with PEVs. Results are also compared with the previously published PEV coordinated charging based on maximum sensitivity selections (MSS). Main contributions are formulating the PEVs charging coordination problem and applying different optimization methods including online FGA and FDPSO considering different driving patterns, battery sizes and charging rates, as well as initial SOCs and requested final SOCs.

However, due to the current low rural electric vehicle ownership, the charging price compensation mechanism is not yet perfect, resulting in the planning period of electric vehicle growth and the willingness to respond to the tariff compensation policy is difficult to accurately assess.Methods This paper proposes a rural photovoltaic storage and charging integrated charging station capacity allocation strategy based on the tariff compensation mechanism. Firstly, we construct a spatial-temporal dynamic distribution model of rural EV charging load coupled with distribution network - transportation network, and on this basis, we consider the rural EV charging time-sharing tariff and tariff compensation policy incentive, and amend the EV charging load transfer model; and then we construct an optimization planning model of charging station with the goal of minimizing the cost of construction, operation and maintenance, and maximizing the charging benefit of the integrated charging station in the rural area, and obtain the optimal synergistic planning scheme under the tariff compensation mechanism in the planning period.Results The optimal collaborative planning scheme under the electricity price compensation mechanism is obtained, and the correctness and validity of the proposed optimal planning method of the rural optical storage charging station under the electricity price compensation mechanism is verified by the example, which is of positive significance in the promotion of the charging facilities to go to the countryside in an appropriate manner, and in the stimulation of the willingness of the rural consumers in the townships to purchase vehicles.Conclusion (1) The spatial and temporal distribution and transfer model of rural EV charging loads with price incentives is constructed by taking into account the preferential charging price policies such as rural time-sharing tariff and tariff compensation mechanism. By comparing the operating revenues of optical storage-charging integrated charging stations with and without time-sharing tariffs and tariff compensation policies, we verified the incentive effect of multiple types of price incentives for the over-planning of rural electric vehicle charging facilities. (2) The proposed optimal configuration method of rural photovoltaic, storage and charging integration charging station can realize the in-situ utilization of rural renewable energy, tap the price competitiveness of photovoltaic, storage and charging integration, and weaken the cost of electricity consumption. By comparing the optimized configuration scheme with and without joint planning, it is verified that the moderate configuration of in-situ photovoltaic and energy storage equipment on the basis of the planning of charging piles brings benefits far exceeding the investment cost, and has a great role in increasing the operational efficiency of rural charging facilities.

First, an EV route planning model is established based on the traffic network. And a multi-period coordination load restoration model is constructed containing distributed generators and EV charging stations. Next, simultaneously considered as constraints, the traffic network and power distribution network are coupled and the route planning model is integrated into the load restoration model to realize the spatio-temporal scheduling of EVs. The load recovery, the power distribution network economy, and EV driving cost are taken into consideration at the same time. Then, piecewise linearization, second-order conic relaxation (SOCR), and deterministic transformation of chance constraints are leveraged to reformulate the model. Finally, comparative analysis of the scheduling results in specific faulty scenarios is conducted on different strategies, confidence levels of chance constraints, and penalty factors. Numerical studies have proven the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy, and the accuracy is verified as well.

Stochastic Planning for Optimal Allocation of Fast Charging Stations and Wind-Based DGs	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL				Article								To unlock the green potential of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy sources are necessary for forming a decarbonized grid. With the rising demand for EVs and fast-charging stations (FCSs), the installation of renewable-based distributed generators (DGs) can further defer network upgrades and minimize energy losses. In this article, a new planning model is proposed to site and size FCSs and wind-based DGs, taking into account the stochastic nature of FCSs, residential EV loads, and renewable generation. The proposed planning model considers different cost and revenue components associated with FCSs and wind-based DGs. A typical distribution network is overlaid on a geographic map to illustrate how the network is connected with the municipal layout, thus taking into account practical constraints for installing FCSs and DGs in the vicinity of each bus. A novel scoring scheme that considers practical geographical aspects is developed to quantify the attractiveness of FCS candidate locations to the drivers of EVs. This scheme is essential to ensure installing FCSs at locations that maximize revenue to investors. Results demonstrate that planning for both FCSs and wind-based DGs is effective from a financial standpoint.

Probabilistic Impact Assessment of Low Carbon Technologies in LV Distribution Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS				Article								Residential-scale low carbon technologies (LCTs) can help decarbonizing our economies but can also lead to technical issues, particularly in low voltage (LV) distribution systems. To quantify these problems this work proposes a probabilistic impact assessment methodology. First, realistic 5-min time-series daily profiles are produced for photovoltaic panels, electric heat pumps, electric vehicles, and micro combined heat and power units. Then, to cater for the uncertainties of LCTs (e.g., size, location, and behavior), a Monte Carlo analysis is carried out considering 100 simulations for different penetration levels (percentage of houses with a LCT). This methodology is applied to 128 real U.K. LV feeders showing that about half of them can have voltage and/or congestion issues at some penetration of LCTs. Furthermore, to identify the relationships between the first occurrence of problems and key feeder parameters (e.g., length, number of customers), a correlation analysis is developed per LCT. Crucially, these results can be translated into lookup tables to help distribution network operators in producing preliminary estimates of the LCT hosting capacity of a given feeder.

In this context, this study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI) approach utilizing the genetic algorithm optimization technique to identify optimal installation nodes for BESS, EV charging stations, and DG units within the grid. The framework aims to minimize energy losses in the distribution system, incorporating a peak load shaving strategy in the BESS. The mathematical model encompasses technical and operational constraints from the resources and the grid. To address the complexity ensuing from exploring an extensive solution space, handling constraints, and managing the decision variables, a real coded genetic algorithm is employed to determine the optimal locations. Through simulations on a distribution feeder, the study demonstrates that resources installed based on the proposed approach significantly benefit the grid. This is evidenced by a reduction in energy losses, improved voltage levels, and demand mitigation during peak periods. An analysis of the BESS impact on losses, with respect to its installation nodes, is also conducted.

J	Bin Humayd, AS; Bhattacharya, K				Bin Humayd, Abdullah S.; Bhattacharya, Kankar			Distribution system planning to accommodate distributed energy resources and PEVs	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								With deregulation of the power industry, environmental policy changes, advancements in technology, and the transformation to smart grid, the distribution planning paradigm has gone through significant changes in recent years. Concurrently, with increase in gas prices, driven by a foreseeable fossil fuel depletion in the future, developments in the automotive sector, and environmental concerns, penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing. These changes will continue to drive the distribution planning problem to evolve in the coming years. This paper presents a comprehensive long-term distribution planning framework from the perspective of local distribution companies (LDCs) considering distributed generation (DG), substations, capacitors, and feeders. Apart from considering the usual demand profile, the proposed framework considers uncontrolled and controlled (smart) PEV charging demand, as well as demand response (DR) options. Based on a back-propagation algorithm combined with cost-benefit analysis, a novel approach is proposed to determine the optimal upgrade plan, allocation, and sizing of the selected components in distribution systems, to minimize the total capital and operating cost. A new iterative method is proposed which involves post-processing the plan decisions to guarantee acceptable adequacy levels for each year of the planning horizon. The performance of the proposed framework is examined considering several case studies on the 33-bus and 69-bus test systems. It is noted from the studies that the presence of uncontrolled PEV charging loads results in much higher plan costs as compared to the case without PEVs, impacts the distribution plan significantly, and hence these loads indeed need be considered in the planning process. On the other hand, smart charging of PEV5 have a much reduced impact on the plan cost, and helps alleviate some investments which were needed with uncontrolled charging PEVs. Therefore, the LDCs and policy makers need to encourage customers to adapt these options in the long-run. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is due to the intermittent generation of RESs and uncertain loads of PEVs, both of which necessitate enhancing the flexibility requirements at the distribution level so as to accommodate the high penetration of these clean technologies in the future. To address such issues, this study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming-based expansion planning model for DNs considering the impact of high RES and PEV penetration, the associated uncertainties, and providing flexibility requirements at the distribution level. In this respect, the spherical simplex unscented transformation, an analytical uncertainty modelling method, is implemented in the planning model to take into account the forecasting errors of the uncertain green technologies. Also, in order to estimate the electric vehicle parking lot demand at each load node of the network, a new approach for PEV-charging model is suggested. To investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed probabilistic planning model, it is implemented on two test DNs, and the obtained results are thoroughly discussed.

This paper investigates the definition, quantification criteria, and multi-indicator comprehensive determination methods for weak nodes in distribution networks. A multi-criteria assessment method integrating voltage deviation rate, sensitivity analysis, and power margin has been proposed. This method quantifies the node disturbance resistance and comprehensively evaluates the vulnerability of voltage stability. Simulation validation based on the IEEE 33-node system demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively identify the distribution patterns of weak nodes under different penetration levels (20 similar to 80%) and varying numbers of DPV access points (single-point to multi-point distributed access scenarios). The study reveals the impact of increased penetration and dispersed access locations on the migration characteristics of weak nodes. The research findings provide a theoretical basis for the planning of distribution networks with high-penetration DPV, offering valuable insights for optimizing the siting of volatile loads such as electric vehicle (EV) charging stations while considering both grid safety and the demand for distributed energy accommodation.

Renewable energy sources (RESs), including electric vehicles (EVs), can be successfully used and carbon emissions reduced by establishing a DC multi-microgrid system (MMGS), which includes renewable energy sources (RESs) and the distribution network. A Multi-Microgrid based Energy Management (MM-GEM) system is suggested to increase the economics of MMGS and minimize the distribution network's network loss. MMG is a network of dispersed generators, energy storage, and adjustable loads in a distribution system that is linked. Furthermore, its operation is deconstructed to reduce communication and control costs with the decentralized structure. "Aside from enhancing system resilience, the MMGEMS substantially impacts energy efficiency, power quality, and dependability". Typical MMGEMS functionality and architecture are shown in detail. This is followed by examining current and developing technologies for monitoring and interacting with data among the MMG clusters. In addition, a wide range of MMG energy planning and control systems for interactive energy trading, multi-energy management, and resilient operations are fully examined and researched.

Reza			Conjugate active and reactive power management in a smart distribution network through electric vehicles: A mixed integer -linear programming model	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								Electrical Vehicles (EVs) have a growing penetration rate in many countries aimed at the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and declining environmental issues. The high penetration rate of EVs, as new electrical energy demands, can cause operational problems for distribution networks. Therefore, designing and implementation of monitoring and management mechanisms for EVs charging is a necessity. EVs are equipped with power electronic-based chargers, bringing them a high degree of flexibility in conjugate active and reactive power control. This capability can be employed not only to reduce the adverse impacts of the high penetration rate of EVs on distribution networks operation but also to support the active and reactive management in distribution networks. In this paper, to employ EVs conjugate active and reactive power control capability, a model for central active and reactive power management in a smart distribution network is proposed. The proposed model is an optimization problem in which the objective function consists of two terms, namely, "minimizing the cost of energy" and "improving the voltage profile", over the operation planning horizon. The constraints of the optimization problem include distribution network operation constraints and charging and discharging constraints related to the EVs batteries and chargers. This problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem and is implemented on the 33-bus, 69-bus, and 133-bus distribution networks. The results show that the proposed model can obtain the lowest energy cost and energy loss and the best operational voltage profile in a completely acceptable calculation time. Moreover, by using the proposed model, supplying the required energy for EVs during their plugin time interval is guaranteed and, increasing the penetration rate of EVs into the network is facilitated.

The goal of the approach is to manage the EV load such that the aggregate power consumption, including inflexible demand and solar generation, closely follows a given target profile. The VOS approach enables EVs in a fleet to compute signals reflecting their need for charge and willingness to supply power. An aggregator collects these signals and implements the control with minor computational effort. We evaluate the VOS approach on a scenario for Munich, Germany, based on a mobility survey and real electricity demand and solar generation data. First, we compare our approach against a centralized optimization in terms of objective fulfillment and solving time. We show that it achieves a competitive performance, especially for large vehicle fleets. Second, we present a statistical method to evaluate the performance and limitations of our approach. We identify a recommended range of the vehicle fleet size for a given load magnitude and show that the target profiles can be met with a defined certainty. Finally, we present a method for further reducing the communication overhead with minor effect on performance.

This paper proposes a realistic and sustainable solution for deciding the location and capacity of the EV fast-charging stations along with the optimal multistage expansion of the distribution network to cope with future load growth. An overlaid traffic network with a distribution network is taken for the realistic approach. EV user convenience factor and user happiness factor are proposed along with the distribution network energy loss for better planning of fast-charging stations. To get charged, the appropriate fast-charging station and its best route are decided through minimum energy consumption by the EVs, considering traffic congestion and distances. Up-gradation of lines, up-gradation of the substation, addition of new fast-charging station, allocation of DSTATCOM and allocation of renewable-based distributed generation are performed for distribution network expansion planning. The whole work is formulated in three layers with a sub-layer. Uncertainties of EV driving patterns, energy requirement, traffic congestion, load and renewable generation are undertaken by the 2m point estimation method. The solution is carried out along with validation using different metaheuristic methods and integer linear programming.

However, in those regions where coal is a dominating power generation fuel source, different opinions about whether EVs can help emission reduction exist. In other words, whether EVs can help emission reduction depends on the energy system configuration and the power generation mix. To achieve the overall emission reduction in both systems, a collaborative planning strategy for electricity and transportation systems is proposed. In the electricity distribution network, the renewable energy source is planned to cope with future demand growth due to the increasing use of EVs. In the transportation network, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are introduced to realize the coordinated development of different types of vehicles. The location of the hydrogen refueling stations can be planned, and the penetration ratio of internal combustion vehicles, EVs, and FCVs is optimized. The proposed planning model is verified on the 46-bus electricity distribution network and the 21-bus transportation network. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and subgradient methods are employed to solve the proposed optimization model. According to the simulation results, the proposed model can achieve the lowest emission since the electricity and transportation systems can cooperate well.

In the DLMP method, the distribution system operator (DSO) calculates dynamic tariffs and publishes them to the aggregators, who make the optimal energy plans for the flexible demands. The DLMP through QP instead of linear programing as studied in previous literatures solves the multiple solution issue of the aggregator optimization which may cause the decentralized congestion management by DLMP to fail. It is proven in this paper, using convex optimization theory, the aggregator's optimization problem through QP is strictly convex and has a unique solution. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the unique solution of the aggregator optimization ensure that the centralized DSO optimization and the decentralized aggregator optimization converge. Case studies using a distribution network with high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs) validate the equivalence of the two optimization setups, and the efficacy of the proposed DLMP through QP for congestion management.

In recent years, research has focused on how to address the issue of large-scale charging and discharging of EVs while ensuring the grid's security. Distribution network operators should choose places where EV charging is practicable in terms of environmental and financial benefits. To establish how to best charge and discharge EVs in the distribution network, first comprehend and then determine the optimal position of EV parking lots in the distribution network. In this article, to solve this optimization problem, first the mathematical model of the problem is built, and then - according to the nonlinear features of the proposed optimization model - the second-order cone method is used to find the optimal solution with high accuracy and speed. The objective functions can accomplish more realistic objectives like lowering losses and minimizing voltage deviation changes with the charging and discharging time control technique, in addition to optimizing the technical requirements of the distribution network. The two-point estimation method of Hang is used to describe the uncertainty in the loads and capacities of solar sources in the random state, and optimization is applied to the IEEE 33-bus distribution system. The obtained results reveal that the proposed method not only meets the charging and discharging requirements of large-scale EVs, but also ensures the stability of the power grid, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in the optimal planning of EVs.

The planning of the distribution network in RAs needs to consider the orderly charging load of EVs. In the current study, an orderly charging planning method for the charging posts and distribution network of RAs was proposed. First, a charging load forecasting model based on the travel characteristics, charging time, and ownership of EVs in RAs was established. Then, a hierarchical orderly charging optimization method, including a distribution network layer and EV access node layer, was devised. The upper layer optimizes the distribution network. The objective function is the minimum variance of the overall load in the RA and the constraint conditions satisfy the overall charging load demand and the capacity of the distributed network. The lower layer optimizes the EV access nodes. The objective function is the minimum variance of the node access load, and the constraint conditions are to meet the regional charging load demand and the optimal power balance demand transmitted from the upper layer to the lower layer. A nonlinear optimization algorithm is employed to solve these objective functions. An IEEE 33 node example was used to obtain the orderly charging power load curves for weekdays and weekends in RAs, and the simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Suitability of PV and Battery Storage in EV Charging at Business Premises	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS				Article								The impact of the electric vehicle (EV) charging on node voltages and feeder currents of an electric grid can be reduced by upgrading its feeder capacity or deploying onsite photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage (BES), or their appropriate combination. It, in turn, enhances the quality of service (QoS) of the charging.

The developed approach takes into account the previously scarcely incorporated characterization aspects (whether it is a constant power, constant current, or constant impedance load) of the EV charging. It has been applied to an IEEE 37-bus system in conjunction with the parking lots of the University of Queensland for a case study.

As electrification of transport ultimately targets CO2 emissions reduction, increased utilization of renewable energy sources is likely to provide the means for reaching the decarbonization objectives.

Limited energy reserves and exponential demand growth have created a serious concern in all sectors including automobile sector. Electric vehicles (EVs) develop better means of transportation as it suppress to the adverse effects in using conventional ways of transportation. Among all the energy requirements, the automobile sector demands almost 21 %. It is a matter of concern because of limited energy reserves. Concerning all the adverse effects of using conventional ways of transportation, scientists and engineers are working on electric vehicles. Intensive research has been going on for decades to make electric vehicles a substitute for conventional transportation systems with the same reliability. The merit for EV charging infrastructure is an indispensable metric that plays a pivotal role in assessing the efficacy and progress of electric vehicle charging networks. This metric encompasses a range of critical factors, including the density and geographical distribution of charging stations, the charging speed and capacity, the utilization rates, the availability of alternative charging options (e.g., fast charging, slow charging), and the integration of optimization technologies for optimal energy management. Apart from technical advancements, the researchers are working on the challenges related to their mass adoption in current distribution system. For large-scale deployment of EVs, reliable and sustainable charging infrastructure needs to be developed. But the charging station placement problem is a complex problem. Charging stations must be placed in the distribution network in such a way that the negative impacts of the placement of charging stations on the operating parameters of the distribution network are minimal. The various aspects to gain deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing charging infrastructure, and to propose innovative solutions for further enhancing the efficiency, accessibility, and sustainability of EV charging networks. The location of the charging station is important and must consider the effect of EV charging demand at existing system with overall charging station placement cost. Therefore, the Voltage Reliability Power loss (VRP) Index (that integrates effect of important parameters such as voltage variation, reliability, and power loss) using Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) is minimized including overall charging station cost as an important constraint for this proposed algorithm. This overall charging station cost includes land cost, installation cost, and energy demand cost by electric vehicles. The results are compared with new discrete versions of different PSO techniques, namely, Standard-Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (S-DPSO) and Passive Congregation Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PC-DPSO) optimization techniques.

The method is to enhance the profit of the wind-thermal-EV hybrid plant while maintaining the grid frequency (fPG) and energy level of the EV battery storage system. In a renewable-associated power network, renewable energy producers must submit power supply proposals to the system operator at least one day before operations begin. The market managers then combine the power plans for the next several days based on bids from both power providers and distributors. However, due to the unpredictable nature of renewable resources, the electrical system cannot exactly adhere to the predefined power supply criteria. When true and estimated renewable power generation diverges, the electrical system may experience an excess or shortage of electricity. If there is a disparity between true and estimated wind power (TWP, EWP), the EV plant operates to minimize this variation. This lowers the costs associated with the discrepancy between actual and projected wind speeds (TWS, EWS). The proposed method effectively reduces the uncertainty associated with wind generation while being economically feasible, which is especially important in a deregulated power market. This study proposes four separate energy levels for an EV battery storage system (EEV,max, EEV,opt, EEV,low, and EEV,min) to increase system profit and revenue, which is unique to this work. The optimum operating of these EV battery energy levels is determined by the present electric grid frequency and the condition of TWP and EWP. The proposed approach is tested on a modified IEEE 30 bus system and compared to an existing strategy to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority. The entire work was completed using the optimization technique called sequential quadratic programming (SQP).

This paper proposes a hierarchical CS planning framework for highway systems by considering the integration of Mobile Energy Storage Vehicles (MESVs) and traffic flow patterns of the highway system in working days and holidays. In the upper level of the framework, an optimization model is formulated to determine the number and locations of CSs, and the configuration of MESVs. Based on these planning results, in the lower level, an operational planning model is established to optimize the charging power of the EVs in the CSs and the operation strategy of the MESVs. The outputs of the lower-level model are fed back to the upper level to update the planning result. This process iteratively proceeds until convergence. Business models are established for the MESVs in working days and holidays separately to accommodate the CSs in serving the EV charging demand of the highway and support the interaction between the CSs and the grid. Numerical simulation based on the real-world data is conducted to validate the proposed method.

However, the stochasticity of EV user behaviors pose challenges to the regulators of distribution systems. How the regulators decide upon a control strategy for the vehicle to grid and how EV users respond to the strategy will significantly influence the variation of load profiles in the planning horizon. In this paper, a comprehensive cost analysis is performed to obtain the optimal planning scheme, considering the variation in EV penetration, charging preference, and customer damage cost. The economics and stability of the planned distribution system are assessed with real-world travel records and cost statistics to quantitatively show the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm and the importance of user behavior concern.

The method includes the two types of uncertainties, aleatory and epistemic, and is developed from an equivalent method that was applied to solar PV hosting capacity estimation. The method is applied to two existing low-voltage networks in Northern Sweden, with six and 83 customers. The lowest background voltage and highest consumption per customer are obtained from measurements. It is shown that both have a big impact on the hosting capacity. The hosting capacity also depends strongly on the charging size, within the range of charging size expected in the near future. The large range in hosting capacity found from this study-between 0% and 100% of customers can simultaneously charge their EV car-means that such hosting capacity studies are needed for each individual distribution network. The highest hosting capacity for the illustrative distribution networks was obtained for the 3.7 kW single-phase and 11 kW three-phase EV charging power.	[Mulenga, Enock; Bollen, Math H.

This article aims at proposing a new framework to maximize the hosting capacity (HC) of DGs in a distribution network. This operation-planning framework provides a suitable and interactive environment for the electricity market, distribution company (DISCO), electric vehicle (EV) aggregator, and rival DISCOs to increase the HC. The problem is modeled via a bilevel conditional-value-at-risk-constrained stochastic programming approach. The DISCO, in the upper level (UL), tries to maximize the HC and minimize the operating costs while interacting with a passive electricity market and an EV aggregator. The aggregator, in the lower level, aims to maximize their profit by interacting with the primary DISCO in the UL and the rival DISCO, to satisfy the EV owners. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are used to recast the model into an equivalent single level. The proposed framework is tested on a 33-node distribution network. Results show how an interactive-based framework can contribute to maximizing the HC of DGs.

Planning for radial PDNs is essential to enhance redundancy resilience, reduce disruptions, and improve overall efficiency. However, traditional PDN planning methods have become obsolete due to the proliferation of Distributed Generation (DG) resources and energy storage systems. Additionally, the rise of Electric Vehicles (EVs) demands sophisticated charging infrastructure planning. This article presents a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for joint expansion planning of PDN and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs). The model takes into account the construction or reinforcement of substations and circuits, along with the integration of EVs, the installation of DGs, and the placement of capacitor banks, all regarded as traditional conventional expansion options alternatives. To address uncertainties associated with DG generation, conventional loads, and EV demand, our model identifies optimal installation and asset locations. We formulate this as a stochastic scenario-based program with chance constraints for Power Distribution Network Expansion Planning (PDNEP), minimizing investment, operational, and energy loss cost costs over a planning horizon. Through two deterministic and stochastic approaches, encompassing six case studies on an 18-node test system, we evaluate the effectiveness of our model. Results are further validated on a 54-node system, confirming the model's robustness. Notably, the numerical findings underscore the substantial cost reduction achieved by including EVCSs in the stochastic expansion planning approach, demonstrating its cost-effectiveness. In case study I, where all EVs charge at home during peak hours, it's the worst case for the PDN. The 54-node system, more complex, demands longer computational time. In the 18-node system, costs improve from 9.97% (case study II) to 3.96% (case study VI) versus the worst-case (case I). In the 54-node system, improvements range from 10.47% (case study II) to 1.40% (case study VI). As a result, In comparative analyses against deterministic and stochastic approaches, our model consistently outperforms in diverse test case studies. The proposed model's adaptability to address uncertainties underscores its suitability for solving the PDNEP problem in PND.

Strategic planning of distribution network integrated with EV charging stations using fuzzy pareto optimality for performance improvement and grid-side emission reduction benefits	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution systems requires efficient charging load management techniques for delivering high-quality power to consumers. In this paper, we proposed a strategic planning approach for distribution systems integrated with EV charging stations, employing fuzzy Pareto optimality to enhance system performance and minimize carbon emissions. Our approach involves a fuzzy Pareto heuristic network reconfiguration to minimize real power loss and improve voltage profiles. Additionally, Time of Use (ToU) pricing-based EV charging load scheduling is developed to minimize the annual energy cost. These objectives aim to improve minimum node voltage, reduce power losses, and maintain branch current constraints. To simulate the impact of EV charging loads, we aggregate residential, commercial, and industrial loads, along with EV charging loads at charging stations based on customer choice time and ToU pricing methods. The proposed reconfiguration approach is tested on 33 and 69-bus distribution systems with integrated EV charging stations, distributed generations (DGs), and shunt capacitors (SCs). The simulation results demonstrate the ad-vantages of the reconfiguration algorithm in enhancing the performance of the distribution network in the presence of EV loads. Furthermore, we compare ToU pricing-based EV charging time zones with customer comfort-based EV charging, showcasing the advantages of the former in reducing emissions through real power loss reduction. Overall, our strategic planning approach not only improves distribution system performance but also offers economic benefits while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions.

The charging station in this research consists of real market PHEVs of different companies with different sizes. The rate of charging of PHEVs is managed via switching control to receive maximum benefits from renewable energy sources and reduce the consumption of electricity from the grid. To support the optimum utilization of sustainable power, charging time and network stability, seven scenarios were developed for different interaction among the proposed micro-grid system and PHEVs. The proposed hybrid smart micro-grid system consists of three renewable energy sources: photovoltaic (PV) array controlled via an intelligent fuzzy control maximum power point subsystem, a fuel cell stack and a microturbine set controlled by proportional integral differential/proportional integral subsystems. A hybrid energy storage system (super-capacitor, battery storage bank and hydrogen) and residential load are also included in the proposed architecture. The hybrid smart micro-grid system is checked in terms of voltage regulation, frequency deviation and total harmonic distortion (THD). It was found that these are in limits according to the international standards. The simulations verify the feasibility of the proposed system and fulfill the requirement of vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle operations in a smart grid environment.

This study addresses these challenges by developing distributed energy management systems for the EVs and the ESSs, and sizing approaches for the PVs and the ESSs, by enabling multi-agent systems and fuzzy cognitive maps. The optimization framework simultaneously considers six key objective functions which studied separately or in limited combinations: (i) ESS installation cost, (ii) low-voltage network operation parameters, (iii) active power losses, (iv) EV charging times, (v) total energy costs, and (vi) excess energy from PV systems. Using environmental conditions and energy purchase costs to define two regions, Heraklion, Greece, and Berlin, Germany, under varying EV integration rates, the proposed methodology enables the IEEE European Low Voltage feeder as a case study and Euclidean distance is used to identify optimal solutions from the Pareto frontiers. Results show that the integration of the distributed ESS contributes to a significant reduction in network's energy consumption, while reduced solar irradiance in Berlin leads to different cost and operational patterns. Heraklion generally achieves better cost efficiency due to higher solar irradiance. Additionally, network operational parameters are significantly improved, and energy costs for residences are reduced up to 39%.

Optimal scheduling of PHEVs and D-BESSs in the presence of DGs in a distribution system	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				Article								Optimisation of cost and load flattening for a distribution network is attempted in this work. The objective function is described in terms of energy cost,CO emissions, real power losses, and load flattening. The solution is envisaged in tes of hourly scheduling of distributed generations (DGs), distributed battery energy storage systems (D-BESSs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). An investigation in the refoulation of the cost of energy is carried out to eliminate the solutions involving excessive charging and discharging of BESSs/D-BESSs and PHEVs. It is demonstrated that simultaneous optimisation of cost, C O_CO emissions, real power losses, and load flattening cannot be effectively solved as a weighted sum objective function. An \varepsilon epsilon-constraint method is applied to obtain the optimal scheduling to achieve cost optimisation, load flattening, and minimisation of C O_CO emissions from the utility point of view. A case of decentralised multi-agent optimisation problem is also foulated and compared. It is observed that the combination of the scheduling of DGs, BESSs/D-BESSs, grid-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-grid can successfully be used to significantly reduce the system peak demand along with system cost, losses and CO2 emissions.

Currently, there exists the problem that some charging station agents do not pay attention to the difference between the charging information of EVs and the charging demand of users, and treat the charge and discharge scheduling of EVs undifferentiated, which results in users' dissatisfaction. This paper presents a three-stage optimization of charging scheduling of EVs, which is based on the electricity price to guide charging selection of users and the continuous charging and discharging of EVs while scheduling. In first stage, the agents provide different charging modes for users to choose from, a charging selection model for users based on EV charging information and the time-of-use (TOU) electricity price is established. The arrival and departure time of EVs, state-of-charge (SOC) and TOU electricity price are all factors that affect users' charging selection. Differential group dispatching of EVs with different charging modes to realize the requirements of the power grid and users. In second stage, based on the charging selection of users and the charging information of EVs, the charging load in different periods can be predicted, which can guide the power purchase for charging agents. The third stage is the integrated charging scheduling of EVs. EVs dispatching is based on the priority, which takes the charge-discharge switching times of EVs into account. The model takes the maximum income of the charging agents as the objective and takes the requirements of the power grid and users as the constraints. Modified adaptive step size fruit fly optimization algorithm (MASSFOA) is utilized to optimize the TOU electricity price, and the optimized TOU electricity price is used to guide EV user's charging selection. The results of simulation analysis show that the proposed strategy can reduce the peak-to-valley difference of the load curve, improve the continuous charging and discharging of EVs, and increase the income of charging station agents.

In this paper, a stochastic transactive management framework is proposed to minimize overall cost and avoid network constraints violation at the distribution network level. This framework includes day-ahead scheduling of electric vehicles and air conditioning loads under demand response aggregators (DRAs), and DERs under distributed generation owners (DGOs) into day-ahead wholesale market in a network managed by a distribution network operator (DNO). An agent called distribution independent system operator (DISO) is responsible for coordination among DRAs, DGOs, and DNO. A heuristic step-size update approach is proposed to calculate the Lagrange multiplier iteratively and improve the convergence speed. This framework is modeled as a quadratic constraint programming (QCP) problem and solved using the GAMS solver. Simulation results on a modified 33-bus system with considerable penetration of loads and DERs, shows that the suggested framework can efficiently reduce the iterations to converge and returns an optimal schedule. And demonstrate the effect of network congestion, demand, and generation uncertainties on the resulting objective values of the agents and magnitude of the Lagrange multiplier values.

A Framework Model for EV Charging Station Deployment in Transportation Network Synchronized With Distribution Network by a Bi-Level Hybrid Optimization Algorithm	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Electric vehicles (EVs) are a promising solution to urban environmental challenges, but their unplanned growth could strain both the road and electric networks. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Combined Model of Road Transport and Electric Distribution Network (CoRTED), a framework for strategically deploying EV charging stations considering the dynamics of both networks. The CoRTED model minimizes EV user travel costs, power loss, and voltage deviation. The model employs a bi-level optimization approach with PSO-DS algorithm for station deployment and combined convex optimization (CCO) for traffic network equilibrium. Grid economic operation is formulated as AC OPF and solved using a primal-dual interior point method. Validation is performed using a modified Nguyen-Dupius RTN and IEEE 33 bus EDN, demonstrating CoRTED's effectiveness in integrated network planning for EV infrastructure. Due to the increase in power demand by EVs, the loss and voltage deviation are increased to 4.679 MW and 24.23%, respectively. The proposed model reduces the losses and voltage deviation by 4.487 MW and 1.24%. Also, the total travel cost on the traffic network is reduced by 1.9% as the charging costs at each charging station are reduced.

This study proposes an active distribution network multi-objective optimization scheduling method. It takes into account the charging demands of large-scale EVs and aims to minimize distribution network operating costs, reduce net load variance, and maximize the photovoltaic (PV) consumption rate. First, the Monte Carlo sampling method is used to analyze the charging load demands of a large number of EVs. Next, we construct a multi-objective optimization scheduling model for the active distribution network. This model integrates the charging demands of EVs with the operating constraints of the distribution network. To tackle the multi-objective optimization problem, we propose the NSGAII-NDAX algorithm. Additionally, we employ a fuzzy theory-based method to select the Pareto optimal solution set, addressing the challenge of decision-making complexity posed by the large size and information-rich content of the optimal solution set. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method in the comparative analysis of multiple scenarios is verified by an improved IEEE 33-node example. The experimental results show that the proposed model and method can effectively utilize EV charging load optimization to reduce the peak-to-valley difference in the system load while ensuring the system's economic operation and the maximum PV consumption rate. Compared with the other algorithms, the NSGAII-NDAX algorithm has stronger optimization ability and can better handle multi-objective optimization problems.

The proposed approach helps to upgrade the infrastructure satisfying the demand for high penetration of EVs with least expansion cost. This approach proposes a routing signal for the arriving EV at the parking lot to guide them to a suitable charger according to the charger and EV battery statuses. The proposed signal increases the utilization EV chargers. Also, the planning approach jointly considers the PV allocation to provide more energy and power capacity for chargers and to reduce overall energy cost. This proposed approach considers coordinated charging /discharging, creating bidirectional power flow between the grid and the EVs. The planning problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program to maximize the net annual revenue. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation technique is utilized to account for the uncertainties associated with the PV generation and the power demand. The outcome of the approach can be described as the optimal quantity and types of EV chargers, along with the optimal sizing of the allocated PV panels. A Multi-case simulation is done to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A Planning Model for an Electric Vehicle Aggregator Providing Ancillary Services to an Unbalanced Distribution Network Considering Contract Design	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Recent advancements in battery technology have made them more economically viable than ever before, making them suitable for various grid-scale applications. Due to their rapid response, batteries are attractive for providing ancillary services (AS), such as frequency regulation and reserve services, to the bulk power grid. On the other hand, an electric vehicle (EV) is viewed as a moving battery; consequently, EVs are also suitable for those services. This research proposes a linear planning model for an Electric Vehicle Aggregator (EVA) within a distribution network (DN) to offer Ancillary Services (AS) to the bulk power grid. The model takes into account contract design by identifying optimal incentives or charging tariffs that Electric Vehicle (EV) owners would be willing to pay the EVA for charging their vehicles. Additionally, the model takes into account the size of the electric vehicle (EV) fleet as a crucial planning factor for EV aggregation that depends on the energy pricing set by the EVA. The proposed model is developed to maximize the overall profit of bidding capacities in the energy and AS markets while supporting the operation of an unbalanced DN by maintaining the DN limits. Simulation results and sensitivity analyses on the model have been carried out to support the investment model and investigate the change in the optimal solution across different case studies. Simulations show that the optimal charging tariff (beta) is (0.02 $/kWh)when considering scenarios where Distribution Network (DN) limits, such as thermal and voltage constraints, are ignored for all EV participation versus beta relations. When including the DN, the optimal payoffs vary based on the relationship between the charging tariff and the number of participating EVs.

For hydropower-rich areas, the "hydropower, photovoltaic, storage and charging" collaborative planning method can effectively utilize and tap the flexible adjustment potential of small hydropower and energy storage to solve this problem. First, with the goal of optimizing economic cost, charging distance and system carbon emissions, a "hydropower, photovoltaic, storage and charging" distribution network collaborative optimization planning model is established. Secondly, the trip chain method is used to predict the charging demand of electric vehicles. The power output curve of a typical day is obtained using the K-means clustering algorithm and the hierarchical analysis method. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms II (NSGA-II) with elite strategy is used to solve the multi-objective model to obtain the Pareto solution set. The optimal ideal solution is used for screening to obtain the optimal planning scheme under different scenarios. Then, a comprehensive evaluation is carried out on the optimal planning schemes of different scenarios. Finally, a case analysis is carried out using the IEEE 33-bus system as an example.

However, the unregulated charging behavior of EVs has a significant impact on the power quality of the distribution network, accompanied by integration with renewable energy sources, which puts double pressure on the grid. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a two-stage collaborative optimization strategy for EV charging scheduling with photovoltaic (PV) system. In the upper-stage optimization, a Variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is presented to learn the real EV charging event distribution, and the generated charging events are used to achieve the optimization of the on-site PV system scale. In the lower-stage optimization, using the optimal PV system scale obtained from the upper-stage optimization to calibrate the output power, a collaborative optimization of EV charging scheduling and PV system using the Lagrange multiplier method is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is analyzed and validated using real-world, full-day charging data collected from charging facilities at the parking lots of Caltech campus. Experimental results show that the optimized charging scheduling strategy can reduce the charging cost, alleviate the peak-to-valley difference of the grid, and promote coordination and complementary with renewable energy sources.

The development of EV technology requires charging infrastructure, which must be considered in the Distribution System Expansion Planning (DSEP). Due to the presence of EV and the load they impose on the distribution system, the planning of EV charging stations is done simultaneously with the DSEP so that the system operator can properly consider the technical constraints of the network and operational constraints. This paper presents a bi-level model for EV charging station expansion planning. The main purpose of the first level problem is expansion planning of charging stations and distribution system. But the charging stations are mostly built by a merchant investor, and they do so when it is profitable and has a reasonable risk. Therefore, the merchant investor should be encouraged to build a charging station in the planned areas. For this reason, in the second level problem, the profitability of the charging station and its risk are examined. To solve this problem, genetic algorithm (GA) has been used. Finally, to test the proposed model, the simulation was performed on a modified 69-bus IEEE network.

There is a substantial increase in the number of EVs due to improved energy efficiency and reduction in environmental impact as compared with internal combustion engine vehicles. The improper planning of fast charging stations (FCSs) and distributed generations (DGs) hurts the distribution system. So the distribution system operator has a significant challenge to identify the optimal location and sizing of FCSs in the distribution power network. This study presents optimal planning of FCSs and DGs with the account of the present and future increase in EV population. A multi-objective optimisation problem is formulated for optimal planning of FCSs and DGs with the objective of minimising the voltage deviation, distribution network power loss, DGs cost and the energy consumption of EV users. This problem is solved for different levels of increase in EV population for different cases.

Enamul			Constrained coordinated distributed control of smart grid with asynchronous information exchange	JOURNAL OF MODERN POWER SYSTEMS AND CLEAN ENERGY				Article								Smart grid constrained optimal control is a complex issue due to the constant growth of grid complexity and the large volume of data available as input to smart device control. In this context, traditional centralized control paradigms may suffer in terms of the timeliness of optimization results due to the volume of data to be processed and the delayed asynchronous nature of the data transmission. To address these limits of centralized control, this paper presents a coordinated, distributed algorithm based on distributed, local controllers and a central coordinator for exchanging summarized global state information. The proposed model for exchanging global state information is resistant to fluctuations caused by the inherent interdependence between local controllers, and is robust to delays in information exchange. In addition, the algorithm features iterative refinement of local state estimations that is able to improve local controller ability to operate within network constraints. Application of the proposed coordinated, distributed algorithm through simulation shows its effectiveness in optimizing a global goal within a complex distribution system operating under constraints, while ensuring network operation stability under varying levels of information exchange delay, and with a range of network sizes.

The charging-swapping-storage integrated station (CSSIS) will also become an effective technical means to achieve orderly charging and an excellent resource to participate in the operation and regulation of the power grid. This paper establishes a two-level active and reactive joint optimization model for active distribution network(ADN) include CSSIS. The outer layer optimization emphasizes the overall active/reactive power output plan of CSSIS from the global perspective of AND, in order to improve the safety and economy of ADN operation and reduce charging cost of electric vehicles. The internal optimization focuses on the specific output plan within CSSIS, achieving complementarity between regulatory resources, and suppressing fluctuations in load power and node voltage. In order to reduce the adjustment pressure of dynamic power supply in real-time optimization, a robust optimization method was adopted in the day-ahead optimization, which improved the system's ability to handle uncertain factors and achieved the "friendliness" of CSSIS connecting to ADN. Finally, the IEEE33 node and 118 node distribution systems were used as examples for validation and analysis, and the results showed that the proposed model and method have good performance in achieving AND multi-time scale active and reactive power joint optimization.

A design strategy is proposed by simultaneously considering a distribution network and an urban transportation network, that maximises drivers' travel comfort in urban trips and reduces costs of both charging station (CS) installation and losses. The proposed strategy meets various constraints such as, properly locating CSs in the city, considering traffic volume, taking the shortest route, reducing charging waiting time, limits of bus voltages, power balance, the permissible loading of lines. The travel comfort index corresponds to a situation in which the driver does not experience a depleted battery and successfully finish the trip. Since the movement of vehicles over the course of a day does not follow any particular pattern, unscented transformation is used to investigate the uncertainty in different probabilistic parameters of EVs. Moreover, by clustering the locations of EVs, the optimal locations of EV CSs are determined over the course of the day (in several time steps) using a multi-objective function based on a GA. The simulation results of the sample urban transportation and distribution networks confirm the efficacy of the proposed method.

Capacity planning of PEV charging infrastructure (EVCI) must ensure not only a satisfactory charging service for PEV users but also a reliable operation of the power grid. In this paper, we propose a quality-of-service (QoS) aware capacity planning of EVCI. In particular, the proposed framework accounts for the link between the charging QoS and the power distribution network (PDN) capability. Towards this end, we firstly optimize charging facility sizes to achieve a targeted QoS level. Then, we minimize the integration cost for the PDN by attaining the most cost-effective allocation of the energy storage systems (ESSs) and/or upgrading the PDN substation and feeders. Additionally, we capture the correlation between the occupation levels of neighboring charging facilities and the blocked PEV user behaviors. We model the EVCI as a queuing network with finite capacity, and utilize the non-stationary queuing models to study the temporal variability of the PEV charging demand. A network of charging facilities is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

J	Hu, Q; Bu, SQ; Terzija, V				Hu, Qian; Bu, Siqi; Terzija, Vladimir			A Distributed P and Q Provision-Based Voltage Regulation Scheme by Incentivized EV Fleet Charging for Resistive Distribution Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION				Article								The capability of onboard bidirectional chargers to deliver both real power and reactive power makes electric vehicles (EVs) suitable candidates for the voltage regulation in the distribution network considering the higher R/X ratio of distribution lines. This article proposes a distributed voltage regulation scheme for dominantly resistive distribution networks through coordinated EV charging/discharging. In the optimal planning stage, the maximal profit of each EV user for the regulation provision is guaranteed, while the driving need can be satisfied. An optimal charging model is proposed to plan the total available P and Q, and a parameter "involvement level" is introduced for the fair pricing of participating EV users. In the regulation stage, an adaptive voltage sensitivity coefficient is developed to estimate the amount of required power for voltage regulation. A novel parallel consensus sharing strategy is designed so that the local power dispatch decision can be made by each EV through information sharing between neighboring buses. The backup support from the local energy storage system (ESS) can be activated under the emergency scenario due to communication failure and insufficient EV resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively and robustly regulate the voltage and is scalable to different network topologies.

Therefore, the current residential distribution network's ability to accept charging load and when and how the distribution network needs to be transformed have become meaningful research points. Based on the characteristics of the EVs' charging load of residential areas on a typical day and the size of the target annual charging load, this paper analyzes the acceptance capacity of the charging load of the distribution network on typical weekdays and weekends. By taking the charging load characteristics, the charging time of EVs, the voltage of each node of the distribution network, the line capacity, the transformation capacity of the distribution station as constraints, and the maximum capacity of the residential distribution network to accept the charging load as the objective function, the charging load capacity of the residential distribution network is analyzed. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to solve the optimized mathematical model. The simulation uses an actual residential distribution network as an analysis example, and the partition optimization results prove the correctness and feasibility of this proposed method.

This paper proposes an optimal planning method for EV charging stations (EVCS) and distribution systems to accommodate the ever-increasing uncertainties. It is achieved by entailing PV-grid-EV transactions, which enables EVCS and PV prosumers to trade energy to make profits while complying with grid securities. It offers a cost-effective operational alternative to long-term planning, which would otherwise result in PV curtailment or unnecessary DNEP. The transactive market operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis and is cleared via a decentralized algorithm to protect privacy and enable autonomous decision-making. EVCS is incentivized by a designed network charge, quantifying its impact on adhering to security constraints from both long-term and short-term perspectives. Considering EV users' charging decisions, we derive optimal EV charging prices to regulate EV charging flow. We employ multiple linearization techniques to ensure the convergence of the non-convex model. Results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the distribution networks to accommodate the large-scale integration of EV and PV more effectively.

J	Ahmad, F; Bilal, M				Ahmad, Fareed; Bilal, Mohd			Allocation of plug-in electric vehicle charging station with integrated solar powered distributed generation using an adaptive particle swarm optimization	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING				Article								One of the industries that use fossil fuels most frequently worldwide is transportation. Therefore, electrifying the transportation system, such as the creation of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), has become essential to reducing the effects of carbon dioxide emissions and using less traditional energy supplies that are not ecologically friendly. PEV deployment must be flawless, necessitating a well-developed charging infrastructure. The best location for fast charging stations (FCSs) is a crucial issue. As a result, this article offers a practical method for choosing the best site for FCSs using the east delta network (EDN). When transportation is made electric, the infrastructure of the electrical distribution network may also need to be changed. Therefore, when adopting FCSs, three factors need to be considered: actual power loss, reactive power loss, and investment cost. The energy demand from the electrical grid is also increased by including FCSs in the power distribution network. To lessen the impact of FCSs on the system, this research report suggests integrating photovoltaic distributed generation (PVDG) at certain places in the distribution network. Consequently, the system becomes dependable and self-sustaining. After deploying the FCSs and PVDGs, the distribution system's dependability is also examined. Six case studies (CS) have also been suggested for deploying FCSs with or without DG integration. As a result, the CS-6's active power loss decreased from 1015.38 to 830.58 kW.

J	Gouveia, EM; Costa, PM; Sagredo, J; Soroudi, A				Gouveia, Eduardo M.; Costa, Paulo M.; Sagredo, Jesus; Soroudi, Alireza			Transmission expansion planning in presence of electric vehicles at the distribution level	INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The planning of the transmission network is an issue that, over the years, has received much attention, particularly due to the impact that this infrastructure has on the safe and reliable functioning of electrical systems. The search for solutions addressing climate change has led to several changes in the functioning of electrical systems, particularly concerning the increasing integration of renewable electricity production. However, in recent years, changes in the load side of the electrical system have also emerged. In particular, electric mobility has been developing, and a high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected in near future. This consumption is supplied by the distribution system but will impact the transmission network. Naturally, the amount of energy used by EVs is subject to uncertainties, which makes the problem complex. Those uncertainties cannot be easily modeled using statistical distributions because of the reduced history of available information. The transmission system operator (TSO) needs an efficient tool to analyze the adequacy of the transmission network to supply the distribution networks with high penetration of EVs. In this paper, a methodology based on symmetric/constrained fuzzy power flow is proposed to find the optimal investment policy at the transmission level while satisfying the technical constraints. The concept of dual variables provided by Lagrange multipliers, the natural result of the nonlinear optimization problem, is used to obtain the most promising reinforcement options considering the actual structure of the transmission network. The proposed model is tested on an IEEE 14-bus system.

At the lower level, the discharging capability of EVs and on-site PV generation are leveraged by individual EVCS for participating in the transactive trading with their peers. Once the lower-level trading is completed, EVCSs trade energy at the upper level through the power grid network managed by the distribution system operator (DSO). The upper-level market is cleared while satisfying the power distribution network constraints. A cooperative game-based model is proposed to model the energy trading among EVCSs. To this end, the asymmetric Nash bargaining method is applied to allocate the grand coalition's payoff to each EVCS at the upper-level market, while a weighted proportional allocation method is used to allocate individual EVCS's payoff to its respective EVs at the lower-level market. The upper-level market formulation is further decomposed into two subproblems representing an energy scheduling and trading subproblem which maximizes EVCS payoffs, and a bargaining subproblem which allocates EVCS payoffs. The effectiveness of the proposed framework for incentivizing transactive trades among EVs and EVCSs is validated in case studies.

Integration of smart grid technologies in stochastic multi-objective unit commitment: An economic emission analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								This paper proposes a stochastic multi-objective unit commitment (SMOUC) problem incorporating smart grid technologies (SGTs), namely, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), demand response programs (DRPs), compressed air energy storage (CAES) units, and renewable distributed generations (DGs). An economic emission analysis of the proposed SMOUC problem with the SGTs is carried out to minimize the total expected operation cost and emission using a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method. A two-stage stochastic programming method is used for dealing with the uncertain nature of power generation from the renewable DGs. Lexicographic optimization in combination with hybrid augmented-weighted c-constraint method are employed to obtain Pareto optimal solutions of the SMOUC problem, and a fuzzy decision making is applied to select the most preferred non-dominated solution. Besides, mathematical modeling of responsive loads can help the independent system operator (ISO) to use a conservative and reliable model to have lower error in load curve characteristic estimation, such as variation in peak load. In this regard, this paper also contributes to the existing body of knowledge by developing linear and nonlinear economic models of price responsive loads for time-based DRPs (TBDRPs), as well as voluntary and mandatory incentive-based DRPs (IBDRPs) based on the customer's behavior (CB) concept and price ratio (PR) parameter. Also, new mathematical indices are proposed to choose the most conservative and reliable economic model of price responsive loads. Moreover, different widely used DRPs are analyzed and prioritized using the strategy success index (SSI) from the ISO viewpoint to determine the most effective DRP which has more coordination with the SGTs. The proposed MILP-based SMOUC problem with integrated SGTs, is applied to IEEE 10-unit test system and is implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) environment. Simulation analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating SGTs into the proposed SMOUC problem from the economic, environmental, and technical points of view.	[Soltani, Z.; Gharehpetian, G.

EV Parking Lots for Flexible Energy Sourcing	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Energy storage is inherently a flexible asset that can be used to reduce renewable energy curtailment and the congestion at its host network, enhance system resilience, and provide ancillary services at peak times. But the cost of technology still hampers the large-scale adoption of storage in power distribution networks. With EV parking lots included in its asset portfolio, a city can take advantage of the power stored in the parked EVs without major capital investments. In this article, we formulate the operation of an EV parking lot from the viewpoint of its owner (i.e., a city or a private entity). The lot works as a market aggregator with operational uncertainties stemming from: (i) random arrival and departure of vehicles, (ii) the SoC of EV batteries at the times of arrival and departure, and (iii) willingness of EV owners to participate. The risks from these uncertainties and market prices of ancillary services impact the bottom line of the lot owner's revenue. For EV owners the excessive up and down cycles of battery is offset by discount offered by the lot owner. We provide an illustrative example and a roadmap to extend this model to take the holistic view of a power distribution network.

Studies on how to collaboratively enable the optimal planning of these interacted networks is less explored. In this work, a joint distribution network expansion planning framework integrated with a shared EV charging station is proposed. One of the objectives is to minimise overall investment cost considering operational waiting cost of shared EV charging service and power loss, while the other aims to maximise the utilisation of charging infrastructures. To overcome the difficulties in solving the multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear problem, Tchebycheff decomposition based evolutionary algorithm is modified to find the Pareto front showing the trade-offs between goals above. Besides, stochastic traffic assignment model is used to obtain traffic distribution and travel demand. The final optimal solution is decided by the fuzzy satisficing method. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a 54-node test system. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of key parameters from the perspectives of transportation and distribution network sectors. The numerical results demonstrate the capability and feasibility of the proposed method.

The rapidly increasing adoption of EVs may affect grid operation adversely. However, the increased integration of EVs, if managed appropriately, can positively impact the performance of the electrical network in terms of power losses, voltage deviations and transformer overloads. This paper presents a two-stage multi-agent-based scheme for the coordinated charging scheduling of EVs. The first stage uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) at the distribution network operator (DNO) level to determine the optimal power allocation among the participating EV aggregator agents to minimize power losses and voltage deviations, whereas the second stage at the EV aggregator agents level employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to align the charging activities to achieve customers' charging satisfaction in terms of minimum charging cost and waiting time. The proposed method is implemented on the IEEE-33 bus network connected with low-voltage nodes. The coordinated charging plan is executed with the time of use (ToU) and real-time pricing (RTP) schemes, considering EVs' random arrival and departure with two penetration levels. The simulations show promising results in terms of network performance and overall customer charging satisfaction.

In this direction, the use of electric vehicles (EV), known as ultra-low carbon emission vehicles, has become widespread in addition to renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generations. The trend of EVs to be preferred the primary means of transport has revealed the effects of charging an additional load on the grid. There is a need to create coordinated charging methods by considering the approaches for real-time charging models of EVs. In this paper, SOC-based EV coordinated charging was proposed for power management to prevent adverse effects including transformer overload, instantaneous peak loading and line overload in the existing distribution network. The proposed coordinated EV charging method was tested on the modified Roy Billinton test system (RBTS) Bus 2 network. AC 11 kW uncoordinated charging units have been respectively 123.76% distribution transformer and 115.16% distribution line overloading for 500 EVs on the grid with 13,9% diversity factor. However, these values that are 72.05% of distribution transformer and 67.01% of distribution grid overloading according to permittable level were decreased by the proposed coordinated charging method. Also, the state of charge (SOC) based coordinated method can increase 3.5% rate the diversity factor of charging capacity at the charging station with PV and battery energy system (BES) while ensured grid stability and energy efficiency.

In order to improve the economy and low carbon of distribution network planning, this paper proposes a low carbon planning method of flexible distribution network considering EV orderly charging and discharging. Firstly, a dynamic charging and discharging boundary aggregation model of EV cluster is constructed based on the EV individual power feasible domain model. Secondly, using the carbon emission flow theory as a tool, a two-layer low-carbon planning model of distribution network considering EV orderly charge and discharge is established. The upper layer plans the distribution network lines, two-way charging piles, and intelligent soft open point (SOP), while the lower layer optimizes EV charge and discharge strategy and user consumption strategy with the goal of minimum comprehensive operating cost. Then, the two-layer nonlinear model is transformed into a single-layer mixed- integer second-order cone programming model by means of upper-lower linkage, large M method and second- order cone relaxation, which is solved by commercial solvers. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the model are verified in the improved 33-node system.

Firstly, a two-stage stochastic rolling optimization framework for active-reactive power scheduling is established. In the first stage, it dispatches the active power of distributed resources. In the second stage, it optimizes the reactive power compensation based on the first-stage scheduling plan. Secondly, the simulation-based Rollout method is proposed to obtain the improved active power dispatching policy for cost optimization in the first stage. Meanwhile, the aggregated power of EVs can be determined based on the mobility and charging demand of EVs. Thirdly, based on the aggregated power of EVs, a scenario-based second-order cone programming is applied to perform the rolling optimization of reactive power compensation for voltage performance improvement in the second stage. The numerical results demonstrate that this method can effectively improve the economic operation of the distribution network while enhancing its operational security by leveraging the charging elasticity of EVs.

The hybrid method is the combination of Eurasian Oystercatcher optimizer (EOO) and spiking neural network (SNN) approach and is usually referred as EOO-SNN approach. The major purpose of the work is to extend the optimal charging strategy for EVs, which includes the allocation of charging resources to decrease the charging costs, increase the charging efficiency, and decrease the impact on the power grid. The EOO is used to optimize various aspects, such as charging time, charging station placement, and network expansion planning. The ideal solution is predicted using the SNN. The approach also combined with smart grid technologies, such as demand response mechanisms and fuel cell integration with battery energy storage system, to optimize the energy system and ensure efficient and sustainable EV charging. The proposed method supports scalability/adaptability in EV charging systems, effective charging strategy formulation, and worldwide optimisation of charging infrastructure growth. The proposed method's effectiveness is then evaluated on the MATLAB platform and compared to other existing approaches. The efficacy of the proposed system is high as 45%.	[Bensam, S.

One of the requirements of this plan is the optimal location of the stations for these vehicles in the network so that they play an effective role in the operation of the network. In this regard, along with the construction of charging and discharging stations for electric vehicles, the construction of renewable sources in the network can play a complementary role for these stations. In this paper, the effect of using renewable resources as a supplement for smart charging stations and the placement of these stations to achieve technical and economic goals have been investigated. In order to manage the demand on the side of consumers and even out the load curve, the time of use mechanism as one of the demand response programs has been considered in this study. In this research, the improved nondominant sorting genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, and the results of the proposed method are also compared with the conventional genetic and particle swarm optimization algorithms. All the simulations have been done in the MATLAB software and on the IEEE 33-bus network. Based on the obtained results, after the implementation of the proposed plan in the distribution network, the objective functions of the loss, voltage drop, and the total cost have been reduced by 13.6%, 58.7%, and 54.4%, respectively, compared to the base conditions of the network.

Probabilistic ESS sizing and scheduling for improved integration of PHEVs and PV systems in residential distribution systems	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								Environmental concerns and oil price volatility have created increased interest in smart grid green energy technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) arrays and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, these technologies have been found to have a significant impact on distribution networks in terms of secondary distribution transformer overloading and increased reverse power flow. Energy storage systems (ESSs) are thought to be an effective tool for mitigating these negative effects. The primary challenge in implementing ESS technology lies in the difficulty of determining the appropriate sizes and operating schedules for these units, given the uncertainties inherent in PV array production and PHEV demand. This paper presents a probabilistic sizing and scheduling methodology for ESSs to facilitate the integration of PHEVs and PV arrays in distribution networks, taking into account different sources of uncertainty present in the system. The technical and economic feasibility of the proposed design methodology has been validated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a variety of scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the contact lines between microgrids are cancelled, so that the microgrids can realize energy interaction through the distribution network. However, this method may lead to overload of distribution network connections while reducing the computation. Due to its good transfer characteristics, the addition of electric vehicles (EVs) can alleviate the contact line pressure and realize the load transfer of microgrids. On this basis, a grid dispatching model based on the participation of EVs in microgrid interaction is proposed. Contact lines between microgrids are replaced by EVs and 100% transmission through the distribution network. The grid load is optimized with the goal of minimizing total cost, maximizing renewable energy utilization, and maximizing profit of each integrator. In the process of model optimization, aiming at the problem that the speed factor in the particle swarm optimization algorithm cannot take into account the optimal direction and the optimal step size, the adaptive time factor is added to establish a two-layer improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, which realizes the cooperative optimization of load and electricity price. The simulation results show that the total cost and underutilization of renewable energy of IEEE33-node system are reduced by 13.79% and 67.85%, compared with the traditional interaction mode, while they are reduced by 0.425% and 6.11% in IEEE43-node system.

J	Avval, AM; Dejamkhooy, A				Avval, Armin Mohajeri; Dejamkhooy, Abdolmajid			A day-ahead energy management strategy for electric vehicles in parking lots considering multi-scenario simulations and hydrogen storage system	IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION				Article								This article investigated the charge and discharge management structure of electric vehicles (EVs) in intelligent parking lots (IPLs). It seems that with the expansion of renewable energy sources (RESs) as clean energy and investigation of the effects of EVs on the operation and planning of future distribution networks around the way EVs exchange energy with each other and the upstream network operator, RESs such as solar and wind sources, along with hydrogen storage are essential. Therefore, a new stochastic multi-scenario approach for charge/discharge management of EVs parked in IPL was proposed, in which a newly developed model for the IPL with a hydrogen storage system (HSS) consisting of a fuel cell, an electrolyzer, and a hydrogen storage tank was presented. In the proposed model, the constraints of upstream network and power balance constraints, with the operating constraints related to the IPL, including EVs, renewable energy sources, and the hydrogen storage system, were formulated as the most important objectives of the optimization problem. The optimization algorithm, Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO), was formulated for implementation, and its results were compared with those of the PSO and GWO algorithms. The CSO must handle a variety of practical, large-scale optimization problems. Based on the obtained results, the excess energy purchased from the upstream network or renewable sources was used as hydrogen storage for consumption during peak hours. As expected, the technical constraints and financial goals of the system were met, and the proposed system was evaluated on a 33-bus network. As the expected benefits will be the most beneficial with the presence of renewable sources, the final profit will be reduced by taking into account uncertainty for charge/discharge management in EVs such as the uncertainty of electric load, market price, wind turbine, and photovoltaic cell sources. Nonetheless, the profit obtained from renewable resources is preferable to losses resulting from the uncertainty of the system, and according to expectation, the performance of the system for managing the optimal charging and discharging of EVs in the IPL will be acceptable with the maximum profit for the grid. This article explores the management of electric vehicle (EV) charging and discharging in intelligent parking lots (IPLs) in the context of the expanding use of renewable energy sources (RESs). It highlights the significance of understanding how EVs interact with each other and the broader distribution network, particularly in the presence of RESs like solar and wind power, as well as hydrogen storage. image	[Avval, Armin Mohajeri; Dejamkhooy, Abdolmajid] Univ Mohaghegh Ardabili, Dept Elect Engn, Ardebil, Iran		Dejamkhooy, A (corresponding author), Univ Mohaghegh Ardabili, Dept Elect Engn, Ardebil, Iran.	majiddejam@uma.ac.ir								1	1											OCT	2024	18	13					2102	2127		10.1049/rpg2.13047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/rpg2.13047		JUL 2024										2025-12-09

Optimal allocation of FCSs and PV units in smart grids considering traffic and generation dispatch	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								Worldwide, transportation electrification and photovoltaics (PVs) have become vital components of modern and future planning problems. Therefore, the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) requires reliable fast-charging stations (FCSs). However, random allocation of FCSs and PV adversely impacts the performance and operation of the traffic flow and power networks. Thus, this paper proposes a new planning approach for the optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs in large-scale smart grids and transportation networks. Unlike existing approaches, the well-known Dynamic Network Assignment Simulation for Road Telematics (DYNASMART) is updated and employed in the proposed planning approach to accurately simulate the EVs within the traffic stream. The average waiting time of the EVs at the charging stations (including charging time) and the total annual costs are utilized as conflicting objective functions to be minimized. To effectively solve this comprehensive model with conflicting objectives, a bi-layer multiobjective optimization based on metaheuristic (NSGA-II) and deterministic (GAMS) algorithms is established. The outer layer optimizes the allocation of FCSs and PV accurately, while the inner one optimally dispatches the generated power of the conventional generation units. The proposed planning approach is tested on a 26-bus electrical transmission network and 92-node transportation system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs with 80% EVs penetration increases the net profit by 85.36% while maintaining a maximum of 30 minutes for both charging and waiting time.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the economic dispatch strategy of planning and operation is proposed to optimize the economy of DN. To better describe the correlation between EV charging demand and price uncertainty, a data-driven uncertainty set based on adjacent days is incorporated into two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model. The proposed uncertainty set abandons the extreme scenario and is closer to the real-world scenarios. In the planning stage, charging piles are upgraded to devices with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service capability, minimizing the planning cost. In the operational stage, the recourse method is adopted to quantify the worst output scenarios for wind, photovoltaic, and EV charging demands, which are reflected as the operating costs of the DN. The numerical simulations are carried out under the modified IEEE-33 bus system, and the nested column and constraint generation (N-C&CG) algorithm is adopted to solve the TSRO model under data-driven uncertainty sets. The results indicate that our proposed model decreases the total cost by 14% to 32% compared to other uncertainty models, which guarantees the economy of the decisions made by the model. The analysis demonstrates that the model possesses low conservatism while ensuring robustness and economy, and is suitable for long-term planning.

Random installation of EVCs may cause voltage disturbances, power quality disturbances and power losses in the distribution network. The hybrid genetic algorithm-modified salp swarm algorithm (HGAMSSA) was used to determine the optimal EVCs placement in the distribution network by considering power losses, network capacity and voltage regulation. HGAMSSA is a combination of GA and MSSA. In the first stage, the GA method distributes the population randomly and the second stage crosses the membership between dimensions. In the third stage, MSSA processes the best population from the GA to determine the best objective function. The HGAMSSA incorporates Optimal Power Flow (OPF) calculations based on Newton-Raphson. The OPF simulation uses a modified 20kV IEEE 33 bus distribution network. For validation, HGAMSSA was compared with four different algorithms: GA, PSO, SSA, and MPSO. There are three test scenarios with populations of 100, 50, and 20. As a result, the power loss generated as the best objective function wase 0.15715 MW. When the population is 100, HGAMSSA has the fastest iteration (5(th)) in achieving the best objective function compared with MPSO (13(th)) and SSA (17(th)). Furthermore, the best objective function can only be achieved by HGAMSSA when the populations are 50 and 20. This shows that HGAMSSA can explore and exploit populations performance to identify the optimal objective function.

J	Esmaeeli, M; Golshannavaz, S				Esmaeeli, Mostafa; Golshannavaz, Sajjad			Optimal allocation of cloud energy storage system in low-voltage distribution network	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								In low-voltage distribution networks, an uncontrolled charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) brings about intensive peak loads in distribution transformers' daily load curves. Due to insulation degradations, this issue ends in transformers' loss of life (LOL) and early aging. The notion of cloud energy storage system (CESS) with larger power and energy capacities enables consumers to have access to cheaper energy storage facilities. Thanks to CESS installation, semi-smart, controlled, and low-cost charging of PHEVs could be realized to relieve the transformer's peak loads and reduce the peak-to-average (PAR) ratio of load curve. To do so, this paper develops an optimal planning model for siting and sizing of a CESS to accommodate the charge/discharge requirements of consumers who are willing to collaborate with CESS and hence, implementing a controlled charging of PHEVs. The proposed model considers the investment and operation costs of both CESS and distribution network. It also models the transformer LOL costs. The PHEVs, in private garages, are supposed to be connected to the grid through a smart module whose connection time and status is optimally scheduled and controlled through the operator of the CESS. The CESS charging/discharging is regulated such that the previously determined time targets of PHEV owners are satisfied. To assess performance of the proposed model, extensive numerical studies are carried out in terms of techno-economic indices say as PAR reduction, conducting energy arbitrage, power losses reduction, and etc. Results are discussed in depth.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

It presents a multi-stage, multi-objective optimization algorithm to determine the battery energy storage system (BESS) specifications required to support the infrastructure. The algorithm results in the minimum BESS capacity and power rating required, subject to the various specific constraints to comply with distribution grid power quality standards by limiting the peak grid demand whilst taking into account several factors over one day, i.e., daily traffic patterns (used to estimate charging system demand), and details of the local electricity network (demand patterns). The optimization method was demonstrated using actual data from an intercity highway and electricity distribution network in a remote highway mid-way between two cities in New South Wales, Australia. The results showed that no BESS is needed up to a critical EV penetration rate, above which both the required BESS capacity and output power capability increase rapidly with the EV penetration rate.

Such an increase in the demand for energy will require optimised management of distribution networks. This study presents a new formulation to determine the optimal size and location of PHEV charging stations to maximise the distribution system manager (DSM) benefit. A two-stage procedure has been considered to optimise PHEV charging station planning. In the first stage, the candidate locations and their size are determined based on: (i) the sum of benefits from the appropriate use of charging station for charging and discharging of vehicles and (ii) the benefit of providing spinning reserve and supplying the network's load demand at peak times by DSM. In the next stage, an improved framework is proposed to classify charging stations into efficient and inefficient sets characterised by non-financial indices. The proposed method is data envelopment analysis efficiency and three indices, including active power loss, voltage profile improvement and CO2 emission. The suggested model is successfully applied to a test system with nine buses. Simulation results show that appropriate planning results in economic benefits as well as improvements in active power losses and the voltage profile.

But the effects are limited by both inherent radial topology and the behaviors of decentralized AEVs. We investigate the potential benefits of dynamic distribution network reconfiguration (DDNR), taking into account AEVs' spatial-temporal availability and their charging demand. We propose a mixed integer programming model to optimally coordinate the charging/discharging of AEVs with DDNR, while satisfying AEVs' original travel plan. Numerical studies based on a test system overlaying the IEEE 33-node test feeder and Sioux Falls transportation network show that DDNR and AEV complement each other, which improves the operation of the distribution system. We also conduct sensitivity analyses on inputs including renewable fluctuation and AEVs penetration level.

J	Nareshkumar, K; Das, D				Nareshkumar, Kutikuppala; Das, Debapriya			A novel planning and operation strategy of solar rooftop EV parking lots in a coupled transportation-distribution network considering uncertainties	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a sustainable path for decarbonizing transportation, and solar rooftop parking (SRPLs) enable their integration with solar energy. The growing adoption of EVs poses challenges for power integration, including peak demand spikes, voltage instability, network congestion, and uncertain charging haviour. Addressing these issues requires coordinated planning and operation that meet both transportation distribution network goals. A multi-stage approach effectively handles multiple objectives. This study introduces strategic two-stage planning and operation of SRPLs in a coupled transportation (TN)-distribution network (DN). In the first stage, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the ideal locations and sizes of SRPLs by integrating a novel EV user satisfaction cost index. The objectives in this stage focus on enhancing the operational performance of both the transportation and distribution networks. In the second stage, the identified locations and sizes are used to determine the optimal operation of SRPLs, taking into account seasonal variations in solar generation and load demand. The objectives aim to maximize SRPL operator profit while minimizing EV user payments, additional DN operator costs, and grid emissions. Fuzzy max-min composition is used to determine the optimal solution by simultaneously satisfying all objectives to the highest possible extent. The proposed technique, idated on real (28-node TN, 69-bus DN) and test (35-node TN, 85-bus DN) systems, effectively identifies SRPL locations, ratings, and operation strategies. Vehicle-to-grid mode of EVs at SRPLs increases profit by 26.19 reduces EV user costs by 6.55 %, and cuts grid emissions by 4.86 %.

Coordinated Bidding of Ancillary Services for Vehicle-to-Grid Using Fuzzy Optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				Article								Electric vehicles (EVs) can be effectively integrated with the power grid through vehicle-to-grid (V2G). V2G has been proven to reduce the EV owner cost, support the power grid, and generate revenues for the EV owner. Due to regulatory and physical considerations, aggregators are necessary for EVs to participate in electricity markets. The aggregator combines the capacities of many EVs and bids their aggregated capacity into electricity markets. In this paper, an optimal bidding of ancillary services coordinated across different markets, namely regulation and spinning reserves, is proposed. This coordinated bidding considers electricity market uncertainties using fuzzy optimization. The electricity market parameters are forecasted using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The fuzzy set theory is used to model the uncertainties in the forecasted data of the electricity market, such as ancillary service prices and their deployment signals. Simulations are performed on a hypothetical group of 10 000 EVs in the electric reliability council of Texas electricity markets. The results show the benefit of the proposed fuzzy algorithm compared with previously proposed deterministic algorithms that do not consider market uncertainties.

On the other hand, issues of stable operation, solving complex constraints, optimizing renewable energy sources, and economic efficiency of EVCS investment in the distribution network are of interest. In this study, we proposed a model to determine the optimal location and size of EVCS in the distribution network with integrated distributed generation (DG) in two objective functions; the first is to minimize power loss, the second is to minimize the cost of power loss and the cost of installing EVCS in the distribution network. The Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimization (CHIO) method is applied to solve the problem; the IEEE 34 bus distribution network is used for testing and it is simulated in Matlab software. The results of the problem are compared with published models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CHIO algorithm, as well as the EVCS location optimization problem model.

Most existing DNR methods rely on accurate network parameters and lack scalability and optimality. This study uses model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for training agents to take the best DNR actions in a given distribution system. Five reinforcement algorithms are applied to the DNR problem in 33- and 136-node test systems and their performances are compared: deep Q-learning, dueling deep Q-learning, deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay, soft actor-critic, and proximal policy optimization. In addition, a new deep Q-learning-based action sampling method is developed to reduce the size of the action space and optimize the loss reduction in the system. Finally, the developed algorithms are compared against the existing methods in literature.

The PEV aggregators are considered as a type of dispatchable demand response and energy storage resource with stochastic behaviors, and can supply load or provide ancillary services such as regulation reserve to the grid. The proposed RO model is then reformulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming model, which can be solved efficiently. Computer simulations are performed for a power grid with ten generators and three PEV aggregators to validate the economic benefit of the RO model for bidirectional dispatch coordination of the PEVs and the robustness of the RO model to the uncertainty of the PEVs' stochastic mobility behaviors.

J	Wei, W; Wu, L; Wang, JH; Mei, SW				Wei, Wei; Wu, Lei; Wang, Jianhui; Mei, Shengwei			Expansion Planning of Urban Electrified Transportation Networks: A Mixed-Integer Convex Programming Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION				Article								/ Electric vehicles (EVs) have been widely acknowledged as one effective solution to alleviate the fossil fuel shortage and environmental pressure in modern metropolises. To foster the large-scale integration of EVs, transportation electrification is becoming an emerging trend. This paper proposes a comprehensive model for the expansion planning of urban electrified transportation networks (ETNs), which determines the best investment strategies for the TN and the power distribution network (PDN) simultaneously, including the sites and sizes of new lanes, charging facilities, distribution lines, and local generators. The steady-state distribution of traffic flow in the TN is characterized by the Nesterov user equilibrium (NUE). The operating condition of the PDN is described by linearized branch power flow equations. To consider the interdependency between the TN and PDN created by the charging behavior of EVs, the power demand of on-road charging facility is assumed to be proportional to the traffic flow it carries. The expansion planning model is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with NUE constraints. In order to retrieve a global optimal solution, it is further transformed into an equivalent mixedinteger convex program through duality theory and techniques of integer algebra; no approximation error is involved. Case studies on a test ETN corroborate the proposed model and method.

J	Domínguez, C; Doña, A; Navarro-Espinosa, A				Dominguez, Catalina; Dona, Agustin; Navarro-Espinosa, Alejandro			Is single-phase residential EV fast-charging a good idea? Evidence from optimal charging plans based on realistic data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								One way to encourage the usage of electric vehicles (EVs) is to reduce the connection time by using higher -powered charging points at home. Nonetheless, a massive adoption of this technology could increase the network power requirements, stressing the grid beyond the technical limits. Therefore, it is important to assess how much the aggregate power will increase compared to the slow-charging process and how to minimize it. Hence, an EV charging coordination model is developed to compare the impact on the system demand of residential slow and fast-charging plans by minimizing the maximum aggregate demand. Here, "slow"and "fast"correspond to the minimum and the maximum charging speeds for 1-phase, mode 3 of the IEC 61851-1. To create an accurate model, realistic UK load profiles, real EV energy requirements, and real travel statistics of car drivers in the UK were included. Additionally, the stochasticity of customers was incorporated by solving the optimization for thousands of different groups of households and EVs. The results indicate that due to the greater flexibility of fast-charging events, if no coordination is considered, the aggregate effects increase by 15% compared to the slow-charging case. However, if the process is coordinated, nearly the same maximum aggregate demand is found regardless of whether the charging is fast or slow.

This paper defines a novel method to the improve economic aspect of distributed energy resources (DERs) in a distribution network through a VPP framework, actively contributing in day-ahead and regulation reserve markets. One of the main novelties of this study is using a forecasted price-based unit commitment approach for VPPs in microgrids with the aim of determining an optimal pricing strategy though addressing real-world operational complexities. Also, this study integrates a dual-role EV parking lots, acting both as a consumer and electricity provider, and explores its potential to minimize costs while optimizing charging and discharging agendas. The proposed optimization model tries to obtain maximum VPP profits in day-ahead and reserve markets by controlling the complexities of distributed thermal and electrical production, energy storage limits, and power balance restraints. By implementing an efficient model based on the a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), a higher solution speeds, global optimality, and scalability for larger problems overcoming traditional limitations such as local optima and infeasibility in large-scale scenarios is achieved. By considering the uncertainties of solar and wind sources, a spinning reservation technique is used to increase microgrid stability. This study also examines how demand response programs help gas stations operate better and facilitate effective energy transfers between VPPs and the upstream network. As a major step toward increasing microgrid profitability and operational efficiency, the results demonstrate the superiority of establishing a strategic pathway for VPPs to optimize energy transactions, set competitive reserve market pricing, and handle market uncertainties.

J	Zhou, X; Zou, SL; Wang, P; Ma, ZJ				Zhou, Xu; Zou, Suli; Wang, Peng; Ma, Zhongjing			ADMM-Based Coordination of Electric Vehicles in Constrained Distribution Networks Considering Fast Charging and Degradation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				Article								Acting as a key to future environmentally friendly transportation systems, electric vehicles (EVs) have attached importance to develop fast charging technologies to accomplish the requirement of vehicle users. However, fast charging behaviors would cause degradations in EVs' batteries, as well as negative effects like new demand peak and feeder overloads to the connected distribution network, especially when plugging in large scale EVs. Decentralized coordination is encouraged and our goal is to achieve an optimal strategy profile for EVs in a decentralized way considering both the need of fast charging and reducing degradations in batteries and the distribution network. In this article, we innovatively model the EV fast charging problem as an optimization coordination problem subject to the coupled feeder capacity constraints in the distribution network. The need of fast charging is expressed by the total charging time, and the relative tendency to fully charge within the desired time period. We introduce a l(0) -norm of the charging strategy which is non-convex to represent the total charging time, and apply the l(1)-norm minimization to approximate the sparse solution of l(0)-norm minimization. The shorter the charging horizon is the stronger willing of fast charging the user has. The objective of the optimization problem tradeoffs the EVs' battery degradation cost, the load regulation in the distribution network, the satisfaction of charging and the total charging time, which is non-separable among individual charging behaviors. Even though alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely applied in distributed optimization with separable objective and coupled constraints, its decentralized scheme cannot be applied directly to the underlying non-separable EV charging coordination problem. Hence, a hierarchical algorithm based on ADMM is proposed such that the convergence to the optimal strategies is guaranteed under certain step-size parameter. Furthermore, a receding horizon based algorithm is proposed considering the forecast errors on the base demand and the EV arrival distribution. The results are demonstrated via some simulation results.

J	Li, JG; Zhang, L; Zhang, B; Tang, W				Li, Jiaguo; Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Bo; Tang, Wei			Coordinated planning for flexible interconnection and energy storage system in low-voltage distribution networks to improve the accommodation capacity of photovoltaic	GLOBAL ENERGY INTERCONNECTION-CHINA				Article								The increasing proportion of distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) and electric vehicle charging stations in low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) has resulted in challenges such as distribution transformer overloads and voltage violations. To address these problems, we propose a coordinated planning method for flexible interconnections and energy storage systems (ESSs) to improve the accommodation capacity of DPVs. First, the power-transfer characteristics of flexible interconnection and ESSs are analyzed. The equipment costs of the voltage source converters (VSCs) and ESSs are also analyzed comprehensively, considering the differences in installation and maintenance costs for different installation locations. Second, a bilevel programming model is established to minimize the annual comprehensive cost and yearly total PV curtailment capacity. Within this framework, the upper-level model optimizes the installation locations and capacities of the VSCs and ESSs, whereas the lower-level model optimizes the operating power of the VSCs and ESSs. The proposed model is solved using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with an elite strategy (NSGA-II). The effectiveness of the proposed planning method is validated through an actual LVDN scenario, which demonstrates its advantages in enhancing PV accommodation capacity. In addition, the economic benefits of various planning schemes with different flexible interconnection topologies and different PV grid-connected forms are quantitatively analyzed, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed coordinated planning method.

J	Nejati, SA; Greenwood, D; Deb, S; Nikkhah, S				Nejati, Seyed Ashkan; Greenwood, David; Deb, Sanchari; Nikkhah, Saman			Efficient techno-economic modelling of smart parking lots within the electricity distribution networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS				Article								The rapid uptake of electric vehicles is transforming public and workplace car parks into large, highly flexible electrical loads whose behaviour must be co-optimised with distribution network operation. Yet explicitly modelling every plugged-in vehicle makes even modest-sized studies computationally prohibitive and masks the economic tension between parking-lot owners and network operators. This paper proposes a cost-driven optimisation framework that converts a smart parking lot into an equivalent energy storage system, retaining hourly accuracy while collapsing thousands of binary charging decisions into a handful of continuous variables, allowing for the co-optimisation of the smart parking lot and the electricity distribution network. In the network, non-linear AC power-flow limits are convexified with second-order cone programming. At the same time, the discrete operating states of the SPL are handled by mixed-integer linear programming. To capture the multi-actor reality, separate objective functions represent (i) the distribution system operator's operating cost and (ii) the smart parking lot owner's profit, allowing for realistic price-signal interactions to emerge without resorting to heavyweight bi-level or game-theoretic solvers. The framework is first benchmarked on the classical IEEE 33-bus distribution network, augmented with photovoltaic, wind turbine, and conventional energy storage resources, and then stress-tested on a real 83-bus primary network from the UK, fed with arrival/departure and state-ofcharge data for 200 real electric vehicles from the My Electric Avenue project. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model confirms that modelling smart parking lots as energy storage system equivalents unlocks their value to modern distribution networks while keeping optimisation complexity manageable.

J	Raj, DB; Murali, V				Raj, Divya Bharathi; Murali, Venkatakirthiga			Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Distributed Generators in Smart Grids: A Multi-Objective Meta-Heuristic Approach	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS				Article								The global transition towards electric mobility has significantly increased the demand for efficient and consumer-friendly Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs). As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to penetrate transportation systems, optimal integration of EVCSs within power distribution infrastructure becomes critical, not only to ensure seamless user experience but also to maintain the reliability and efficiency of electrical networks. Traditionally, EVCS planning has been carried out solely within the context of Radial Distribution Networks (RDNs), neglecting key consumer-centric factors such as travel comfort and accessibility within the road network (RN). This paper proposes a novel, consumer-aware methodology for optimally placing EVCSs and Distributed Generators (DGs) in a combined RDN-RN framework. The objective is to minimize active power loss, voltage variation, and EV consumer cost, measured through two proposed indices, while accounting for realistic travel behavior and preferences. The proposed approach utilizes a Modified Weighted Teaching Learning Based - Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (MWTLB-PSA) and proceeds in three stages: EVCS site selection based on road network considerations, DG placement using predetermined EVCS locations, and a final stage of simultaneous optimization of both elements. To validate the approach, a standard IEEE 33-bus RDN integrated with a 25-node RN is employed as the test system. Results demonstrate that the joint optimization of DGs and EVCSs via the proposed method significantly enhances network performance and consumer convenience. Notably, the solution achieves a reduced active power loss of 57.75 kW and an EVCCI value of 0.3958, indicating a substantial improvement over existing hybrid TLBO and PSO-based techniques.

The condition requires that the allowed reverse power flow is only reactive or active, or none. Under the proposed sufficient condition, the feasible sub-injection region (power injections of nodes excluding the root node) of the ac OPF is convex. The exactness of the convex relaxation under the proposed cond (s) over bar ition is proved through constructing a group of monotonic series with limits, which ensures that the optimal solution of the SOCP can be converted to an optimal solution of the original ac OPF. The efficacy of the convex relaxation to solve the ac OPF is demonstrated by case studies of an optimal multi-period planning problem of electric vehicles in distribution networks.

Many uncertainties concerning, e.g. the evolution of conventional loads, renewable production and electric vehicles (EVs) make it difficult to predict the location of the distribution network's weaknesses (overvoltages, undervoltages and overcurrents) and their occurrence. In some cases, alternative solutions such as demand response (DR) and reconfiguration can remove the constraints and prevent expensive network investment. This study proposes a two-stage algorithm that is able to give the probability that no technical constraints will appear as a function of the reinforcement cost with and without using DR and/or reconfiguration. The first stage of the algorithm consists in running Monte Carlo simulations based on realistic scenarios for loads, EVs and renewable production development provided by French governmental roadmaps. The cost of reinforcement per line and per hour of constraints enables selection of the feeders, where DR (solved with linear programming) and/or reconfiguration (exhaustive research) will be implemented in the second stage of the algorithm to remove these constraints. The methodology is applied to a real part of a French distribution network.

To address these issues, we propose an integrated, multi-timescale battery dispatch framework that unifies long-term capacity planning, day-ahead/intra-day scheduling, and sub-minute real-time control. The framework combines HOMER Pro-based capacity sizing, a MISOCP model for economic scheduling, and an agent-based simulation for immediate overload mitigation. In a case study of a Danish distribution network projected to reach full EV penetration by 2034, our approach reduced moderate-to-severe overload incidents by 82.7%. Furthermore, a price-sensitive variant achieved a 27.4% reduction in operational costs, with only a 12.5% increase in minor overload events. These quantitative improvements, alongside qualitative enhancements in grid stability and battery longevity, provide actionable insights for distribution system operators.

In view of the coordinated charging of EVs under the photovoltaic (PV) energy connected to the power grid, a collaborative charging control strategy is proposed based on a double deep q-network with Prioritized experience replay (DDQN-PER). Specifically, Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is utilized to capture the uncertainties caused by power requirement, PV power, and real-time electricity price. Then, a modified DDQN approach and the corresponding reward function are applied to solve the cooperative charging problem. In addition, the introduction of a PER mechanism based on TD bias sampling in reinforcement learning alleviates the problem of reward sparsity in learning scenarios and improves the training stability and efficiency. The proposed approach can achieve collaborative scheduling of EVs, which helps reduce the charging cost, promote the consumption of PV energy and avoid transformer overload. Simulation case studies based on real data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the charging cost by 30% and increase the PV power utilization by 10% compared to the DDQN algorithm.

For this, this work develops a collective energy consumption scheduling (CECS) algorithm in the residential sector based on a combination of energy consumption plans under a bi-level game theory method. The local level is responsible of gathering internal users' data and reducing the energy consumption in each residential building. The central level is the external demand management system that is focused on modeling a coalition between the local load management modules, as well as giving the redistributed demand profile to increase the global profit through a peak load minimization, financial gain and peak-to-average-ratio reduction. Four controllable appliances are included in load shifting and time activation cycling: clothes dryer units, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, electric water heater, and electric vehicle. The principle of the proposed CECS method relies on the flexibility of the user requirement that presents one of the contributions of this study. It proposes a novel framework for determining optimal non-static load management strategies, in which consumers can change their daily power demand patterns depending on their routines, preferences and requirements. Numerical results show that time-varying schemes encourage customers to condense their electricity consumption within low-price periods. However, by incorporating the proposed approach of coordinated scheduling algorithm significant profits in the whole and single level are demonstrated. Simulations infer that given the same load profiles, the proposed framework outperforms the non-coordinated strategy leading to important rates in total peak load minimization, total saving in electricity bills and reduction of peak-to-average-ratio.

Since a shared electric grid is suffering from power superimposition when several trams charge at the same time, we propose to install stationary energy storage systems (SESSs) for power supply network to downsize charging equipment and reduce operational cost of the electric grid. To evaluate the trade-off between component cost and operational cost, an optimisation problem, which integrates type selection, sizing, energy management and different installation configurations of the SESSs, is introduced and formulated in terms of an annual cost. Disciplined convex modelling is applied to obtain a computationally tractable solution for a case study on an existing line in China.

J	Nareshkumar, K; Das, D				Nareshkumar, Kutikuppala; Das, Debapriya			Economic planning of EV charging stations and renewable DGs in a coupled transportation-reconfigurable distribution network considering EV range anxiety	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING				Article								To support the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) in the transportation network (TN), one significant obstacle has to be addressed: range anxiety, i.e. concern about running out of energy before finding another charging station. This study proposes a two-stage strategy for optimal placement and sizing of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and renewable distributed generators (DGs) in a coupled TN and distribution network (DN) by considering EV range anxiety. In the first stage, an integer particle swarm optimization algorithm and M1/M2/S queueing theory are used to find the best locations and sizes of EVCS while ensuring possible origin-destination round trips in a TN can be completed with a waiting time constraint. The objective function considered in this stage is maximizing EVCS operator profit. In the second stage, DN integrated with EVCS is used to obtain the ideal sites and sizes of renewable DGs. Modified Newton-Raphson load flow with a Q-PQV bus pair determines the ideal sites and sizes of renewable DGs while improving DN performance. A cost-benefit analysis is carried out to check whether DG planning is profitable. Hong's 2 M+1 point estimate method incorporates the uncertainties related to EV behaviour and renewable sources. The validity of the proposed strategy is investigated using a coupled 33-bus DN with a 25-node TN system. The results reveal that considering EV range anxiety, the suggested approach effectively identifies the best locations and sizes for EVCS and renewable DGs beneficial for both EVCS and DN operators. Additionally, network reconfiguration increases the DN operator's profit.

Along the same line, self-healing is one of the most distinguishing features of the smart grid that could improve the reliability of the system up to a logical extent. In this study, the reliability of the electrical distribution grid has been improved by optimal allocation of automatic switches and parking lots (PLs). Thus, the optimal places of switches and PLs are determined with the purposes of minimising a combined effect of the customer-based (system average interruption duration index) and cost-based [total reliability cost (TRC)] reliability indices. The TRC includes customer interruption costs, PLs and automatic switches investment costs, and the total cost of PLs incorporation in the service restoration process. The proposed approach is implemented in three different planning scenarios: switch placement, PL placement, and joint switch and PL placement. The particle swarm optimisation method is employed to solve optimisation problems. Finally, a standard reliability test system bus number four of the Roy Billinton test system (RBTS 4) is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

This paper proposes the improved flow-capturing location model (FCLM) with mix-integer linear programming (MILP), in which the location of FCSs, alongside the electricity sale price to PEVs, is optimized so that the profit of the distribution company (DISCO) is maximized. Also, it considers renewable energy resources (RESs) to support FCSs. DISCO is assumed to be in charge of the cost of stations, the expansion network, RESs, and the electricity purchase from the network. The goal is to determine with how much price DISCO should sell the electricity to PEVs for the return on investment (ROI) rate to be positive at a specified time. Moreover, the PEV owners' non-utilization function is considered in such a way that the electricity sale price to PEVs in stations has a direct relationship with the PEV owners' non-utilization. In addition, the growth of PEVs, electric load, and electricity purchase from the network are considered. The proposed model has been implemented on a 25-node urban traffic network fed by a 33-bus distribution network. The results demonstrate that the investor provides electricity for PEVs with less price in the proposed model because the investment costs of FCSs are reduced by 34.4%. Also, by raising the PEVs' charging demand, the electricity sale price in the station is reduced. In this condition, the utilization of PEV owners is maximized. Moreover, considering RESs reduces voltage drop and electricity sales price to PEVs.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electricity demand will increase sharply and there will be fluctuations in the networks. The only way to cope with this problem is to switch to smart networks. This article examines and economically analyses the method of switching from a vehicle to a network, which is considered to be used to solve the problem of fluctuations caused by the integration of renewable energy sources into the network. For this purpose, unlike other studies in the literature, a simulation study was conducted that took into account both the battery life of the car and the driver's behavior. The research to be done in smart networks and renewable energy sources should not be accepted only for home consumers. In terms of competitiveness, industrial consumers need to choose devices that support smart grids when developing and planning their systems. Researches on energy quality and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is very important in this regard.

The TVPP exploits diverse distributed energy resources' (DERs) flexibility capabilities in order to offer flexibility services to wholesale flexibility market as well as preserving the distribution network's operational constraints in the presence of DER uncertainties. The TVPP aims at maximizing its profit in energy and flexibility markets considering the worst-case uncertainty realization. In the proposed framework, the first stage models the TVPP's participation strategy in day-ahead energy market and determines the DERs' optimal energy dispatch. The second stage addresses the TVPP's strategy in intra-day flexibility market to determine the DERs' optimal flexibility capability provision by adjusting their energy dispatch for the worst-case realization of uncertainties. The uncertainty characteristics associated with photovoltaic units, electric vehicles, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and other responsive loads as well as the transmission network's flexibility capability requests are considered using an adaptive robust approach. Adopting the duality theory, the model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and is solved using a column-and-constraint generation algorithm.

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from & x0024;3.55 million to & x0024;1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58 & x0025; to 22 & x0025; when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20 & x0025; penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from & x0024;2.52 to & x0024;0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106 & x0025; to 14 & x0025;, respectively. It is also realized that the integration of PV improves voltage profile and reduces the negative impact of EV load. Our optimization model can work for commercial areas such as offices, university campuses, and industries as well as residential colonies.

To maintain their current operations, a clear understanding of the charging infrastructure required and its relationship to existing power grid limitations is needed. This study presents an optimization framework to jointly design charging infrastructure and schedules within a logistics distribution network, validated through agent-based simulations. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and develop an agent-based model (ABM) to evaluate various designs and operations under stochastic conditions. Our experiments compare rule-based and optimized strategies in a case study of The Netherlands. Results show that current commercial solutions suffice for middle-mile logistics, with central co-design yielding average cost reductions of 5.2%-6.4% and an average 20.1% decrease in total installed power. While rule-based control effectively manages charging operations and mitigates delays, optimizing charge scheduling significantly reduces queuing times (99%), charging costs (13.5%), and time spent near capacity (10.9%). Our optimization-simulation framework paves the way for combining optimized infrastructure planning and realistic fleet operations in digital-twin environments.

One of the outcomes from this study shows that traditional approaches to allocate distributed energy resources in distribution networks underestimate the impact of adopting EV and PV on the grid. The comparison of different allocation methods with the presented diffusion model suggests that using conventional approaches might result in strong underinvestment in capacity expansion during early uptake and overinvestment in later diffusion stages.

This proposed algorithm reduces the voltage fluctuations via the optimal adjustment of the tap positions of on-load tap changers and of the reactive power injections of inverter-based distributed energy resources. Based on the proposed voltage control algorithm, an industrial implementation framework is established to enable the interactive communications among the on-load tap changers, the inverter-based distributed energy resources, etc. Compared to previous studies on voltage regulation in microgrids, this work is distinguished by the fact that the proposed voltage control algorithm is implemented and tested on a real-world experimental test site, known as the micro smart grid on the EUREF-Campus in Berlin. Constraints, such as actual process latencies are readily observed. The micro smart grid comprises a power transformer with on-load tap changer, rooftop photovoltaic systems, battery energy storage systems, and electric vehicle charging stations. The real-world test results confirm that the voltage deviations are significantly reduced by the coordinated voltage control algorithm, as opposed to the uncontrolled state. Thanks to the analysis of the trigger cycle of the proposed algorithm, the lifetime of the on-load tap changer can be extended while ensuring the effectiveness of voltage control.

Therefore, one of the original challenges in the development of EVs is the optimal allocation of FCSs considering the goals and limitations of both transportation and distribution networks. This paper proposes a model for locating FCSs and renewable energy resources (RESs) taking into account the EVs behavior as well as a wide range of affecting factors, including the uncertainty associated with the RESs, EVs arrival rate, and state of charge (SoC), different driving ranges, and all-shortest and deviation paths. The proposed model minimizes the costs of installing FCSs and RESs and substation expansion and maximizes the traffic flow captured by the FCSs. For this purpose, first, the modeling of the uncertainties of RESs and the capacitated diversion flow-refueling location model based on expanded networks (CDFRLM-EN) is introduced to cover the charging demand of EVs on the transportation network. Then the problem of locating FCSs and RESs is formulated based on the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The proposed framework is implemented on a 14-bus distribution test system coupled with a 25-node transportation network. The results show that the presence of RESs, diversion paths, and the uncertainty associated with the arrival state of charge and the driving range differences influence the location and size of FCSs, the investment cost, and the EVs' satisfaction.

Increasing the PEVs' load modelling accuracy leads to more precise and reliable operation and planning approaches. This study presents a methodology for possibilistic-probabilistic-based PEVs' load modelling in order to be employed in optimal wind distributed generation (WDG) planning. The proposed methodology considers not only the PEVs temporal uncertainty, but also the uncertain spatial effect of PEVs on WDGs as renewable-based distributed resources. The WDG planning is considered as an optimisation problem which is solved under technical and economic constraints. A hybrid modified particle swarm optimisation/genetic algorithm is proposed for optimisation that is more robust than the conventional algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed load modelling of PEVs and the proposed algorithm is evaluated in several scenarios.

Reliability Enhancement of Puducherry Smart Grid System Through Optimal Integration of Electric Vehicle Charging Station-Photovoltaic System	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								Distributed generation strengthens distribution network reliability by placing generators close to load centers. The integration of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) with PV systems mitigates the effects of EV charging burden. In this research, the objective is to combineEVCSs with distributed generation (DG) units in the Puducherry smart grid system to obtain optimized locations and enhance their reliability. To determine the right nodes for DGs and EVCSs in an uneven distribution network, the modified decision-making (MDM) algorithm and the model predictive control (MPC) approach are used. The Indian utility 29-node distribution network (IN29NDN), which is an unbalanced network, is used for testing. The effects of PV systems and EVCS units are studied in several settings and at various saturation levels. This study validates the correctness of its findings by evaluating the outcomes of proposed methodological approaches. DIgSILENT Power Factory is used to conduct the simulation experiments. The results show that optimizing the location of the DG unit and the size of the PV system can significantly minimize power losses and make a distribution network (DN) more reliable.

Dealing with uncertainty in smart grids is critical in order to mitigate possible issues. This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic model for a large-scale energy resource scheduling problem of aggregators in a smart grid. The idea is to address the challenges brought by the variability of demand, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and market price variations while minimizing the total operation cost. Benders' decomposition approach is implemented to improve the tractability of the original model and its computational burden. A realistic case study is presented using a real distribution network in Portugal with high penetration of renewable energy and electric vehicles. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach when compared with a deterministic model. They also reveal that demand response and storage systems can mitigate the uncertainty.

Techno-economic analysis of energy storage systems integrated with ultra-fast charging stations: A dutch case study	ETRANSPORTATION				Article								A fast and efficient charging infrastructure has become indispensable in the evolving energy landscape and thriving electric vehicle (EV) market. Irrespective of the charging stations' internal alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) bus configurations, the main concern is the exponential growth in charging demands, resulting in network congestion issues. In the context of exponential EV growth and the provision of charging facilities from low-voltage distribution networks, the distribution network may require frequent upgrades to meet the rising charging demands. To avoid network congestion problems and minimize operational expenses (OE) by integrating energy storage systems (ESS) into ultra-fast charging stations (UFCS). This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of a UFCS equipped with a battery ESS (BESS). To reduce reliance on the electric grid and minimize OE, a dual-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved via grid search and dual- simplex algorithms. Analytical energy and physical BESS models are employed to evaluate the optimization matrices. The intricacies of BESS aging are examined to ensure an optimal BESS size with a more extensive lifespan than the corresponding payback period. The integrated BESS significantly reduced reliance on the grid to tackle network congestion while fulfilling charging demands. The dynamic pricing (DP) structure has proven more favorable, as the average per unit cost remains lower than the static tariff (ST). Results illustrate that integrating BESS reduces the OE and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) by 5-to-49% and 16-to-73%, respectively. Moreover, the combination of 70% BESS and 30% grid capacities outperforms the other configurations with a 73% reduction in PAR and a 49% reduction in OE before BESS reaches the end-of-life.

We propose a two-stage stochastic programming approach -with scenario-based algorithms- that explicitly considers vehicle-to-grid (V2G) peculiarities (four-quadrant operation and stochastic human factors influence: V2G willingness, walking distance, and charging patterns). Considering those factors together with MES uncertainties -RES generation, load demands, and electricity price- enables a comprehensive study of V2G and MES impact on EVCS planning. The proposed approach is applied to both a purely electric distribution network (EDN) and an MES to analyze the interplay of EVCSs in different energy domains, in consideration of different V2G contracts. The obtained results underline that the sole consideration of the EDN can lead to non-optimal results, while the more comprehensive analysis leads to optimal planning of all energy resources and cost savings. Finally, we analyse how each considered factor individually impacts EVCSs planning.

Therefore, in this paper, the cost model of EV DR and incremental cost rate (ICR) model of load response are established at first for solving the problems. Then, the ICR update criteria of agents are designed. Based on the criteria, an improved discrete-time leader-following consensus (IDTLFC) algorithm based on ICR is proposed. Also, the cooperative control method of EVs participating in DR based on the algorithm was presented. By employing the proposed algorithm, the method can calculate the ICR and response load value of agents. Likewise, the quick reduction of total system power offset and the completion of response load indicator can be achieved by utilizing the EV response layer to execute the response instructions. In the simulation experiments, the simulation model of multi-agent system based on EVs is established. The two system working modes of "peak shaving and valley filling" (PSVF), plug-and-play characteristic of agents and so on are simulated. The results have shown that, when EV are linked to the grid and generate the power fluctuation, the total power balance and the stabilization of VCS could be kept with the method. The PSVF, minimum response cost and reasonable power distribution are realized simultaneously. The system has superior dynamic and steady-state performance, too.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, the emergence of integrated transportation-power energy systems has garnered considerable attention. It is urgent to realize a coordinated operation of the energy systems.

In the transportation network, a traffic assignment model with the elastic charging demand and effective path generation models with the mileage limitation of electric vehicles are established to calculate the actual charging demand of electric vehicles and traffic flow distribution. In the power distribution network, an optimal power flow model based on second-order cone relaxation is established to calculate the power flow distribution and scheduling plans of generators. And then, based on the idea of alternating direction multiplier method, a distributed coordinated operation method and solution algorithm for the integrated transportation-power energy systems are proposed.

Besides considering the optimality of the expected charging cost, the proposed model innovatively incorporates the matching degree between wind power and EV charging load into the objective function. Fully taking into account the uncertainty and dynamics in wind energy supply and EV charging demand, this stochastic and multistage matching is formulated as a Markov decision process. In order to enhance the computational efficiency, the effort is made in two aspects. Firstly, the problem size is reduced by aggregating EVs according to their remaining parking time. The charging scheduling is carried out on the level of aggregators and the optimality of the original problem is proved to be preserved. Secondly, the simulation-based policy improvement method is developed to obtain an improved charging policy from the base policy.

Developed model and corresponding calculations are based on the algebra of random variables. Main factors which affect the flexibility of electric vehicles are identified and modelled first. Modelled quantities and their mutual links are then incorporated into the probabilistic model. Cumulative distribution of charging duration, discrete probability of charging on particular day and discrete probabilities of possible start charging time are presented in the paper as the probabilistic model outputs. Finally, limits of available flexible capacity [kW] are calculated and presented as the main flexibility indicator for specified test cases.

J	Gao, XW; Song, DM; Jiang, LL; Zhou, K				Gao, Xiaowen; Song, Dongming; Jiang, Leilei; Zhou, Kun			Grid-aware charging infrastructure deployment: A hybrid monte Carlo and improved hummingbird algorithm for cost-efficiency and load balancing	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								The large-scale grid connection of electric vehicles is increasingly putting pressure on the distribution network, and the problem of load imbalance poses serious challenges to the stability and operational efficiency of the power grid. The current research mainly focuses on single facility planning or simple optimization models, which are difficult to solve the complex interaction problems between spatiotemporal charging dynamics, user service demands, and grid constraints. To this end, this study proposes an innovative framework for collaborative planning of charging and swapping facilities. Firstly, Monte Carlo simulation of spatiotemporal load distribution is used to coordinate the allocation of charging and swapping facility resources, breaking through the limitations of traditional isolated planning. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed, using a weighted sum strategy to coordinate construction costs, user waiting time, and grid stability indicators, achieving dynamic balance of conflicting objectives. Furthermore, the Improved Hummingbird Algorithm (IAHA) is developed, which integrates chaotic mapping to enhance population diversity, and combines non-uniform mutation to achieve adaptive global local search, effectively solving high-dimensional complex programming problems.

Hence, this paper presents the problem of optimal placement and sizing of distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESSs) from the viewpoint of distribution system operator to increase the network flexibility. The problem is formulated as an optimization framework wherein the objective function is to minimize the annualized sum of investment costs and operational costs of DBESSs while it is constrained to power flow, DBESS and RES constraints as well as distribution network operation limits. In addition, while the problem model is as nonlinear programming, this paper suggests an equivalent linear programming model for all constraints and quadratic formulation for the objective function to reach the global optimal solution with low error calculation. In the next step, the Benders decomposition approach is deployed to acquire better calculation speed.

The distribution automation platform consists of automatic voltage and VAR control and automatic fault management systems. The objective function minimizes the sum of the expected daily investment, operation, energy loss and reliability costs.

Among these applications, AMI is playing an important role in delivering data from customers to power utilities, supporting reliable real-time monitoring, and remote operation of power quality data and voltage profile. The AMI consists of smart meters, data aggregation points (DAPs), the utility control center, and communication networks. Appropriate network planning plays an essential role in facilitating the exchange of data between consumers and power utilities as well as accommodating new smart grid applications and future growth. This work proposes an optimal placement of DAPs for AMI based on machine learning clustering techniques in residential grids. Network partitioning is introduced to create sub-networks and graph algorithms generate a deployment topology given optimization constraints. A new measurement metric called coverage density is considered to indicate neighborhood area networks (NAN) zones with the appropriate coverage. Three real scenarios of NAN are considered: urban, suburban, and rural. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with conventional heuristic optimization methods with respect to average and maximum distance between smart meters and DAPs, coverage density, and execution time.

Large charging demand brings formidable challenges to existing power networks, driving them near to their operational limits. In this regard, it becomes pivotal developing novel energy management strategies for active distribution networks that take into account the strategic behaviour of parking lots. This paper focuses on this issue, developing a novel energy management tool for distribution networks encompassing distributed generators and parking lots. The new proposal casts as a tri-level game equilibrium framework where the profit maximization of lots is implicitly considered, thus ensuring that network-level decisions do not detract the profit of parking owners. The original tri-level model is reduced into a tractable single-level mixed-integer-linear programming by combining equivalent primal-dual and first-order optimality conditions of the distribution network and parking operational models. This way, the model can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers, with superiority against other approaches like metaheuristics. The developed model is validated in well-known 33-, and 85-bus radial distribution systems. Results show that, even under unfavourable conditions with limited distributed generation, charging demand is maximized, thus preserving the interests of parking owners. Moreover, the model is further validated through a number of simulations, showing its effectiveness. Finally, it is demonstrated that the developed tool scales well with the size of the system, easing its implementation in real-life applications.

In this paper, a multi-objective planning model is proposed for the distributed generations that considers the transportation loads and the typical source-load spatiotemporal scenarios. Firstly, the probability model of distributed generation and various electric loads are established. And the typical source-load spatiotemporal scenarios are established according to the probability theory and the multi-scenario analysis method. Then three objective functions are represented for the planning model, the objective functions includes the economic objective minimal average annual comprehensive cost of distributed generation, the technical objective maximal comprehensive utilization rate and the security objective minimal average voltage offset of the bus. The multi-objective function is solved by a hybrid multi-objective algorithm, which combines Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing.

For maximum utilization of distribution network without compromising the security and reliability of the supply system, determination of critical loading is crucial. With this objective, this paper proposes a modified DC continuation power flow based approach for determining the loadability limit of the active DCDS. DC-DC converters play an important role in bus voltage regulation and system loadability. Impact of these converters must be accounted in any analysis and planning of active DCDS. In this paper, two different mathematical models of lossless DC-DC converters are developed to account them in power flow model of the system. The proposed approach can be applied to both radial and meshed DCDS. Impacts of integration of converters in the system are illustrated by results of two realistic DCDS and results are compared with the corresponding AC Distribution Systems (ACDS).

This paper simulates the main last mile distribution models that can be adopted in a mega-city such as Madrid. In particular, the impact of carrying out the full load of the last mile distribution by means of electric vehicles is analyzed. Two fundamental aspects are studied, the efficiency of the different routes developed by each transport vehicle and the impact that these routes have in the electrical distribution network. For this purpose, an intelligent route planner, capable of optimizing the distribution of the load among the number of vehicles available in each postal service hub (PSH), is combined with a Reference Network Model that designs and expands the distribution network to supply consumers and electric vehicles. Several scenarios in terms of location and segmentation of postal service hubs are analyzed. From this analysis, it is concluded that reinforcements on the distribution network are avoided if the operation is decentralized (using fourteen PSHs), since a centralized operation (a single PSH) would require longer routes with higher energy consumption. Moreover, decentralized operation would enhance the emissions reduction achieved by electrifying the fleet, since the estimated absolute emissions of the electrified fleet for a decentralized scenario are up to 50% lower compared to a centralized one. Finally, the results reveal that smart charging strategies also contribute to lessen the incremental costs in the distribution network, in addition to significantly reducing the cost of energy supply.

This requires an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs). Such an allocation strategy should provide acceptable charging services at different deployment stages while meeting financial and technical constraints. As new CSs get allocated, distributed generation (DG) units need to be also dynamically allocated in both space and time to compensate for the increment in the loads due to the EV charging requests. Unfortunately, existing power grid models are not suitable to reflect such spatio-temporal evolution, and hence, new models need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal expanding power grid model based on stochastic geometry. Using this flexible model, we perform a dynamic joint allocation of EV CSs and DG units based on a constrained Markov decision process. The proposed dynamic allocation strategy accounts for charging coordination mechanism within each CS, which in turn allows for maximal usage of deployed chargers. We validate the proposed stochastic geometry-based power grid model against IEEE 123-bus test system. Then, we present a case study for a 5-year CSs deployment plan.

As the world's largest automotive market, China has recently made the electrification of transportation central to its national strategic plan. Because of the unique nature of the vertically regulated power industry, China's massive deployment of PEVs has to face unique challenges that may not be encountered by any other country/region. Therefore, a comprehensive coordinated PEV charging scheme is urgently needed to facilitate the smooth grid integration of PEVs at all levels (e.g., transmission systems, distribution systems, and charging stations). This paper presents detailed mathematical modeling of a novel hierarchical framework for coordinated PEV charging at multiple timescales (i.e., day-ahead and real-time). The proposed three-level (e.g., provincial level, municipal level, and charging station level) PEV charging strategy jointly optimizes system load profile and charging costs while satisfying customer charging requirements. The interrelationships between various levels in terms of energy transaction and information exchange are clearly identified. Case studies on Guangdong Province, China, are carried out and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed hierarchical control framework in reducing system peak demand and charging costs.

Lower emission, convenient charging experience, high performance, and energy security are considered as the significant benefits of the mentioned technology. Despite the aforementioned advantages, inappropriate place and size of CSs have brought new challenges for electric distribution systems. Prominent features of distributed generations (DGs) make this technology appropriate for compensating relevant problems of CSs installation. In this paper, simultaneous optimal planning (placing and sizing) of CSs and DGs is presented to address new challenges. In addition, financial (investment costs), technical (system reliability, power loss, and voltage profile), and environmental (CO2 emission) issues are considered in the proposed objective function. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the simulation study is carried out on a 33-bus radial distribution network. The simulation results show the effects of installation of CSs in the presence/absence of DGs on total costs, reliability, loss, voltage profile, and emission. Moreover, the effects of increasing PEV's availability are evaluated on the aforementioned terms in the electric distribution network.

Designing future residential LV networks with EVs and PVs: a bi-period OPF-based approach	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and residential photovoltaic (PV) systems in three-phase low voltage (LV) networks is prompting the need for cost-effective designs in brand-new neighborhoods that address the challenges of managing voltage (drop/rise) and asset congestion. This requires selecting the most appropriate conductors, transformers, and voltage regulation devices, which becomes a complex combinatorial problem. This paper proposes a bi-period three-phase AC Optimal Power Flow methodology to minimize asset costs while capturing the time-dependent impacts of EVs, PVs, and the locational effects on the transformer's primary voltage. The proposed approach is demonstrated using two realistic residential Australian LV networks: one having a single circuit with 31 houses, and another having multiple circuits with 89 houses. The approach identified optimal designs for both networks that minimize costs addressing the technical challenges. For single-circuit networks, off-load tap changers with thicker conductors is the most cost-effective design for both close and distant locations (relative to the primary substation). However, in multi-circuit networks, particularly in distant locations with significant voltage variations, on-load tap changers with thinner conductors is the most cost-effective design. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual network characteristics to optimally design brand-new LV networks with EVs and PVs.

The energy communities will consist of clusters of multiunit buildings and or single residential units aggregated sharing a common or multiple medium and low voltage (MV/LV) electrical substations. The size and impact of the location of these MV/LV substations can constitute a barrier especially for highly urbanized contexts where it is very complicated to provide technical spaces inside buildings for large technical systems like transformers, MV switchgear, etc. The idea of this work consists of developing a compact outdoor MV/LV substation to reduce the overall dimensions and to make the execution modularized to facilitate management and maintenance.

However, the joint modeling and optimal scheduling for multiple BSSs is complex and rarely researched, especially when the idle state of charging bays (CBs) is non-negligible. In this article, for the distribution network (DN) with multiple BSSs, a joint optimal charging scheduling strategy considering the idle state of CB is developed to ensure the system's safe operation and BSSs' economic charging. In particular, a three-layered coupled model for multiple BSSs is constructed by modeling on the CB, BSS, and DN layers, which is used to visualize each BSS's state quantity changes and their charging behaviors' impacts on DN. To further improve the accuracy of this model, the CB's idle state is given special consideration by developing a three-stage modeling method, which can detailedly describe the finite state transfer of CBs. In addition, to deal with the joint scheduling of multiple BSSs (JS-MBSS) problem upon the constructed model, a bi-level solving algorithm is proposed to convert the complex JS-MBSS into a solvable mixed integer quadratic constraint program (MIQCP). Finally, the proposed strategy and two others are verified via the modified IEEE 33-bus system. The results suggest that by adopting the proposed strategy, the total charging cost and the cumulative voltage fluctuation are reduced by 39.42% and 30.84%, respectively, which verifies the proposal's positive benefits in stabilizing grid operation and enhancing the charging economy.

The advent of plug-in electric vehicles introduces a number of new network players, such as gridable parking lot owners (GPLOs), which might have conflicting objectives with DNO's ones. This paper presents a dynamic bi-level model for distribution network planning considering different objectives of DNO and GPLO. The power injection capability of gridable parking lots (GPLs) is employed as an alternative supply source to enhance the network flexibility in supplying loads under faulty conditions. Moreover, the proposed planning approach is developed in a way that the economic risk of the plan associated with the stochastic nature of the GPL behavior is controlled. Different test networks are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Battery-based solutions can be operated following different control objectives and support the grid to reduce the investment need in conventional assets. A grid planning algorithm is developed to perform this comparison. The impact of the rollout of distributed energy resources on a Danish urban grid is assessed, based on a forecasted scenario and the geographical distribution of new loads and generators until 2045. Fast charging stations are added to this rollout, and the resulting grid issues are mitigated using a conventional grid reinforcement method. In a second iteration, batteries are installed in combination with fast charging stations to support them. The remaining capacity is used to solve the previously mentioned grid issues, using controllers that achieve good performance. The technical and economic impact of the conventional grid reinforcement and the battery-based one are compared in a cost-benefit analysis. Depending on cost sensitivities, the battery-based alternative can range from being 40 % cheaper to over 1400 % more expensive than a conventional grid extension-despite potential investment deferrals, which are often outweighed by higher capital costs and energy losses. Across all battery connection topologies and price sensitivities, the conventional grid upgrade solution remains the most cost-efficient one in 89 % of all investigated cases, with the battery-buffered one being only competitive in edge cases.

But the same turns out to be advantageous if the EVs are used to support the utility based on the requirement. In this work, an attempt is made to efficiently schedule both the grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid operational modes of EVs with the objective of reducing power loss in the distribution system in presence of distributed generation (DG). The EVs are modeled by considering the dominating factors, such as EV State of Charge (SoC), trip conditions, EV battery capacity, charging/discharging levels. An improvement to the existing grasshopper optimization technique is also suggested in this article, which enhances the exploring capability of the metaheuristic algorithm. The presented methodology is a combination of smart charging method, voltage stability index, and enhanced grasshopper optimization algorithm (EGOA), which decides the size of DGs to be placed in the system. The proposed hybrid approach tries to schedule both the EVs and DGs so as to achieve reduced power loss and improved voltage profile. In order to test the robustness of the proposed strategy, various analyses considering uncertainty in EVs and load conditions are performed.

Therefore, the critically planned charging stations infrastructure is essential to resolve these problems. In fact, the distribution network operators (DSO), EV users, and intelligent commercial parking lots (CPL) owners are holding different views that should be considered simultaneously to improve the accuracy of an effective business plan. However, the prime challenge in addressing the planning of CPL is to increase the EV user interest while enhancing the CPL owners' profit. Simultaneously, DSO requirement for network performance under the appropriate conditions (for example, imbalance) will also be considered. Further one of the main challenges of CPL presence in an imbalanced distribution network is the effect that additionally carry on network imbalance indices. In this paper, a two-stage framework has proposed where the first stage is accompanied with several technical parameters such as battery terms, charge/discharge specifications, and transportation parameters including daily distance traveled, arrival and departure times to the CPL, and amount EV sales, the profitability of the EV charging/discharging program for EV users as well as CPL owners calculated in the optimal CPL scheduling. In the second stage, the effect of CPLs is studied by calculating the imbalance indices in a standard IEEE imbalanced distribution network. Moreover, the results confirm that the average profit for EV users has been increased by 23% compared to the total cost paid for charging EV. Eventually, it is recognized that without changing the distribution network structure and connecting CPL to active commercial loads of the distribution network, the network imbalance could be improved around 30% during EV charging.

In this context, this paper investigates the utilization of a SL-BESS to support the home energy management. In particular, the paper establishes the SL-BESS's model and the multi-scale satisfaction indices required to verify the dwelling satisfaction conditions of a building occupant. These satisfaction indices account for: (i) the usage satisfaction associated with the controllable, plug-in appliances to ensure that these are operated based on the occupants' desired preferences; (ii) the indoor thermal comfort that is controlled through the air conditioner's operation, and; (iii) the acoustic comfort that accounts for the possible disturbance induced by the appliances' operations. The proposed many-objective home energy management system identifies operation plans for the controllable home energy resources, aiming at establishing a trade-off among a variety of home operation considerations, including the household energy cost, the SL-BESS's lifetime preservation, the multi-scale satisfaction indices, and the Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR) of the home load. A Reference-Point-Based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) based solving approach is developed for obtaining the Pareto frontier of the proposed system and numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed method.

Optimal allocation of battery energy storage systems for distribution networks based on probabilistic power flow (PPF) is an effective solution to deal with these uncertainties. However, the high computational burden is the main obstacle of this method. Therefore, this paper proposes a surrogate-assisted multi-objective probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) to reduce the expensive computational time. The surrogate model is developed by using a machine learning method namely deep learning which is used for bypassing the deterministic load flow calculation. Zhao's point estimation method combined with Nataf transformation is selected to handle the PPF analysis considering correlated uncertain input variables. The multi-objective POPF problem is solved using the multi-objective differential evolution. The historical data including solar irradiation, ambient temperature, residential load, and electric vehicle (EV) travel distance is calculated in the low voltage distribution system to demonstrate the potential advantages of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed surrogate assisted multi-objective POPF method provides the optimal solution for operating cost, helps to prolong transformer life and reducing environmental impact. Moreover, the results show that the proposed surrogate-assisted optimization framework gives a better solution when comparing with the conventional surrogate-assisted method.

The upper-level formulation of the problem minimizes a normalized objective function (a dimensionless function), which is a normalized summation of the expected annual energy cost and expected annual energy loss of the ADN, subjects to linearized AC optimal power flow (LAC-OPF) equations. Also, the lower-level problem minimizes the annual investment and expected operating costs of flexible and renewable sources constrained to the planning and operation model of these sources in the FRVPP framework. The suggested scheme incorporates the unscented transformation (UT) method to model the uncertainties of load, energy price, and renewable power generation. Then, the KarushKuhn-Tucker (KKT) approach converts the proposed bi-level problem into a single-level optimization formulation to achieve the optimal solution using conventional mathematical solvers. Finally, the proposed scheme is applied to a standard test system.

The AFV development is promoting the coordination among electric power, natural gas, and transportation (ENT) networks. This paper proposes a coordinated planning method for investment on and operation of emerging urban energy infrastructures. The sites and sizes of refueling stations are optimized along with the expansion strategies for electric power distribution network (PDN) and natural gas distribution network (GDN). First, AFV refueling demands are analyzed according to the refueling station constraints and options, and transportation network (TN) constraints. Second, the coordinated planning model for PDN and GDN is formulated along with respective operation constraints in PDN, GDN, and TN. An efficient MILP solution method is developed for the proposed optimization problem. Finally, several case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and its solution method. Compared with existing solutions, the proposed panning method offers a more accurate AFV refueling demand model with various refueling options. It is demonstrated that the coordinated planning can reduce investment and operation costs of urban energy infrastructures by exploring the pertinent interactions among constrained PDN, GDN, and TN.

Due to the discrepancies among EV owners, their responses to scheduling can differ significantly. Therefore, to achieve better scheduling results, it is crucial to consider the impact of these discrepancies on the optimal scheduling. This paper proposes a classified scheduling method for different types of EV owners. According to charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) data of EV owners, the K-means clustering algorithm (K-means) is used to classify EV owners, and the demand response (DR) model is established based on the classification results. The DR model is designed to account for the diverse responses of different EV owners, and the price elasticity, time gap elasticity, and preference time elasticity are important factors in the model. This paper adopts the maximization of smart grid's revenue as the optimization objective through three approaches: (1) modifying the charging and V2G of EV; (2) obtaining V2G prices for all types of EV; and then (3) adjusting the power output of each unit. To evaluate the proposed method, the IEEE 10-unit system is employed for simulation, and the optimization problem is solved using the CPLEX solver. Compared to previous studies, the proposed classified scheduling method exhibits significant improvements in terms of revenue maximization, load distribution among different types of EVs, generation cost savings, and load variance reduction.

A comprehensive optimization framework for EV-Renewable DG coordination	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								This paper develops an optimization framework for coordinating electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) in distribution systems. A bilateral contract between EV aggregators and renewable distributed generators (DGs) is first used to maximize revenues for these market participants by optimally controlling EV charging/discharging. The developed market-based EV control model is then implemented in a distribution system and evaluated for its potential adverse effects on the system operation. An optimal capacitor sizing and placement method is proposed to resolve the negative impacts of such control model. The proposed capacitor optimization method along with the developed EV control model provides an EV-RES coordination framework that simultaneously addresses both market and operational objectives. A real distribution network is used to test the EV-RES coordination method and evaluate its performance for different loading conditions using three-phase unbalanced load flow calculations. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in not only providing cost savings for the system operation, but also in reducing the losses and voltage deviations that would be otherwise incurred due to uncoordinated EV scheduling. The proposed EV-RES coordination framework is demonstrated to ensure economic, safe and reliable operation of distribution systems in which EVs and renewable DGs synergize.

One way to address these challenges is to use storage devices that can store surplus energy from RESs and discharge the energy back to the grid when needed. Researchers have recently introduced the idea to use electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, which are called "gridable vehicles" (GVs), as storage devices in the smart grid. Using GVs as loads is well accepted, but as sources, they disrupt system reliability if insufficient GVs are available for discharging when needed. An availability planning model is thus required to address this issue. GV owners' concern over battery lifetime reductions is another issue that impedes the required participation rates for GVs in vehicle-to-grid discharge programs. In this paper, we present an intelligent smart grid system model, which mitigates real-time unavailability of GV sources via an availability planning model. We also propose a GV selection model that prevents GV batteries from premature expiry due to their vehicle-to-grid operations. Simulation results confirm that our proposed models maintain better overall reliability and increase average battery lifetime by up to 3.5 years compared with existing vehicle-to-grid models.

Operational and Planning Perspectives on Battery Swapping and Wireless Charging Technologies: A Multidisciplinary Review	IEEE ACCESS				Article								The electrification of the transportation system is considered one of the most viable solutions to address the pressing need to shift towards sustainable development. However, one of the major challenges to the rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the lack of the right charging infrastructure where and when it is needed. Motivated by the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach, this study addresses the complex operational and planning challenges involved in integrating transportation and electrical networks for effective EV charging. Thus, this research aims to survey the literature to identify the adopted technologies, and the application and allocation of the right mix of the technologies to better serve the seamless adoption of EVs. That problem is multifaced where transportation network requirements and the electrical grid are important to support the charging loads at the needed time. The literature survey adopts the PRISMA methodology, contributing to the existing literature by highlighting the following shortcomings: 1) the problem of allocating the charging technology is either purely viewed from a transportation or an electrical perspective, 2) there is a gap in adopting both networks' requirements comprehensively, 3) the literature predominately focuses on a single technology either battery swapping or wireless charging, 4) introducing new technologies highlights the impact of each on both networks in terms of return of investment, traffic flows, and power grids operational conditions, 5) research direction is focused more towards operation and routing while service allocation is relatively new and has not yet been extensively explored, and 6) transportation network research focuses on a static representation of the transportation network and EV demand. This study's main contribution, besides identifying critical gaps in the existing literature and possible future research directions, is the proposal of a novel framework that integrates multiple charging technologies. This framework is designed to optimize infrastructure deployment, enhancing the efficiency and economic viability of EV charging systems across both transportation and electrical networks.

When supported by vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled charging stations, EVs can provide effective supplementary power for disaster-stricken areas. However, most existing stations only support unidirectional charging, limiting the resilience-enhancing potential of V2G. To address this gap, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented restoration optimization model that jointly considers the siting of V2G-enabled charging stations and PDN topology reconfiguration. A novel metric-Resilience Entropy-is introduced to dynamically characterize the recovery process. The model explicitly describes fault propagation and circuit breaker operations, while incorporating power flow and radial topology constraints to ensure secure operation. EV behavioral uncertainty is also considered to enhance model adaptability under real-world post-disaster conditions. The optimal siting scheme is obtained by solving the proposed model. Case studies demonstrate the model's effectiveness in improving post-disaster supply and recovery efficiency, and analyze the impact of user participation willingness on V2G-based restoration.

This problem is framed as a two-objective optimization, where the expected energy that the network would not deliver in the case of an earthquake or flood (expected energy not-supplied), and the annual planning cost of the VPP, are the two objective functions to be minimized. Noted that the expected energy not-supplied in the earthquake or flood condition is considered as the resiliency index. The constraints include the formula for VPP planning, limitations on network operation and resilience, and equations for AC power flow. Uncertainties about demand, renewable power, energy prices, and the supply of network hardware and VPP components are all taken into account in stochastic programming. The proposed technique achieves a single-objective formulation in the subsequent stage by the use of a Pareto optimization strategy based on the epsilon-constraint method. This article uses a solver based on a hybrid of Crow search algorithm (CSA) and sine cosine algorithm (SCA) to achieve the trustworthy optimal solution with lowest dispersion in the final response. In order to tackle the problem, the proposed system looks at how the VPP affects network resilience, scales it, and combines it with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm. In the end, with the implementation of the proposed design on the distribution network of 69 buses, the obtained numerical results confirm the ability of optimal placement and dimensions of VPPs in improving the economic status, utilization and resilience of the distribution network.

Therefore, to support investment decision making there is a requirement to understand the impact LCTs will have on low voltage (LV) distribution network infrastructure across diverse geographical areas. However, LV networks are not only radically different in terms of topology and physical asset characteristics, but also in terms of the demand they serve which is sensitive to the diversity of local conditions such as climate, consumer demographic and building stock. As such, there is an increasing requirement to capture elements of this diversity in the development of LV network and LCT modeling approaches to better quantify place-based LCT impact and to inform the quantification of local area flexibility. In turn, using Python and OpenDSS, this work presents a novel scalable approach to localized LV network and LCT impact modeling by coupling two methodologies; a LV network model development methodology and a LCT impact assessment methodology which accounts for both the electrification of heat and transport with consideration for the diversity of residential heat demand. The methodology is demonstrated on LV networks in Scotland through quantification of LCT network impact against key network assessment metrics. The findings demonstrate the value in spatial and temporal high-resolution modeling at scale, emphasizing a need to consider the combined impact of electrified heat and transport in future network investment planning.

These include elevated power losses, voltage imbalances, and adverse environmental impacts. This study proposed a hybrid objective optimization framework to address these issues by minimizing real and reactive power losses, voltage deviations, voltage imbalance indexes, and CO2 emissions. Nineteen simulation cases were analyzed under various configurations incorporating EV integration, PV deployment, reactive power compensation, and zonal control strategies. An improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO) was employed to determine optimal placements and control settings. Among all cases, Case 16 yielded the lowest objective function value, representing the most effective trade-off between technical performance, voltage stability, and sustainability. The optimized configuration significantly improved the voltage balance, reduced system losses, and maintained the average voltage within acceptable limits. Additionally, all optimized scenarios achieved meaningful reductions in CO2 emissions compared to the base case. The results were validated with an objective function Fbest as a reliable composite performance index and demonstrated the effectiveness of coordinated zone-based optimization. This approach provides practical insights for future smart grid planning under dynamic, renewable, rich, and EV-dominated operating conditions.

Reactive power compensation from photovoltaic (PV) inverters and active power curtailment of PV output are commonly used to mitigate voltage-related problems. However, the charging/discharging flexibility of EVs can be used to avoid PV output curtailment and save energy motivating methods to coordinate EV charging with PVs. Unfortunately, a large number of control variables makes the centralized voltage control computationally expensive. In this work, a decentralized voltage control algorithm which considers the active and reactive power compensation from PV inverters and EVs is presented. The proposed approach helps to solve the voltage issues in a more effective way. The approach involves clustering of the distribution network based on modified modularity, an index that considers EV flexibility and prediction time period. A model predictive control (MPC)-based algorithm is proposed for each cluster to solve the voltage problem using the respective PVs and EVs, while ensuring that the EV charging demand is satisfied while contributing to the voltage regulation. The proposed algorithm is validated using the IEEE 123 node test systems under two PV and EV penetration levels and shown to be effective in solving the voltage regulation problem.

Conventional methods often fail to jointly address the interdependencies between these two systems, leading to suboptimal planning and increased operational costs. To address this issue, a two-stage joint-optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously optimize EV charging station siting and electric logistics vehicle (ELV) routing within PDNs. In the first stage, a multi-objective optimization model is employed to determine optimal charging station locations, balancing infrastructure costs and traffic flow capture efficiency. In the second stage, an adaptive routing model integrates charging constraints to optimize ELV operational costs. A hybrid optimization algorithm, combining self-adaptive MOEA/D and genetic algorithm with best-first search (GABFS), is developed to enhance computational efficiency and solution robustness. The proposed approach is validated on a benchmark distribution network with logistics scenarios, demonstrating significant reductions in both capital investment for charging infrastructure and logistics operational costs. The findings underscore the importance of coordinated charging and logistics planning in accelerating the transition towards sustainable electrified logistics networks.

Advanced active network management is to coordinate generation, network, load optimization and achieve the right balance between operational expenditure (OPEX) and capital expenditure (CAPEX). To demonstrate the advancement from introducing an active distribution network, the key features of distribution network planning mainly including traditional models is first introduced. Extensive literature in generic planning is then summarized and categorized in terms of objective functions, system modeling, solution algorithms, and tools. This is followed by an extended review and in-depth discussion of concepts and representative topic developments in optimal active distribution network planning. In contrast to traditional planning, it takes into account the effects from a range of active network interventions that are exercised at differing time scales while capturing the intrinsically stochastic behavior of renewable generation or demand response to produce strategic plans that are robust against a highly uncertain energy future. Finally, a multi-dimensional framework for optimal active distribution network planning is proposed to overcome the limitations of the current state of the art, and the challenges in each stage are also highlighted.

Multistation integrated system (MSIS) can resolve the aforementioned power quality issues. In this article, a new topology for a MSIS is proposed, which uses soft open point as the key equipment of the system and adopts the hierarchical power supply mode for a data center, electric vehicle charging pile, and other function stations. Based on the topology of the MSIS and smooth switching of the converter control mode, a coordinated control strategy is proposed to control the working mode of each function station and further optimize the system operation conditions. The small signal model of the MSIS is derived, which can provide theoretical support for the stable operation of the system. The simulation results of two different application scenarios verify that the proposed topology of the MSIS and coordinated control strategy effectively improve the voltage level of the distribution network, enhance the reliability of sensitive load power supply, and ensure safe and reliable operation of the MSIS. Finally, the fusion and integration functions of the MSIS are tested and verified. The on-site demonstration indicated a mutual win-win situation for the power supply company, energy supplier, equipment provider and users.

In that context, this paper proposes a new methodology to enhance the security of power supply in a distribution network by strategically integrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) micro grids based on the nodal criticality. The nodal criticality is assessed by integrating operational uncertainties of events into samples of Monte Carlo simulation and then classifying load interruptions on the basis of their magnitudes and frequencies. The load shedding due to criticality of system stress is classified into arrays of clusters on the basis of magnitudes of interrupted loads. The critical clusters that provide the largest disturbances to nodal loads are used as the reference capacities of PHEV micro grids to mitigate impacts. Case studies are performed by applying the methodology into a realistic model of a distribution network. Results depict that the proposed methodology can improve the system-wide security of supply. There are some nodes of which the security of supply can be improved significantly. The levels of improvement in security of supply of nodes are not consistent and some nodes can also receive marginal improvements.

Two issues should be addressed particularly for the optimal sizing of SLBs. Compared with fresh batteries, the failure rate of SLBs is relatively high, and timely and preventive replacement is needed. In addition, the flexibility introduced by EVs and installed SLBs should be coordinated to achieve optimal economic benefits. This paper focuses on the efficient utilization of SLBs by highlighting reliability-flexibility concerns in optimal sizing. The model is formulated as a bi-level model. On the upper-level, considering the operational reliability constraints of SLBs, decisions regarding the investment and replacement of SLBs are optimized. Distribution network operations are improved on the lowerlevel, with an effective spatiotemporal flexible dispatch strategy for EVs. Finally, a linearized process for the optimal sizing of SLBs is presented and efficiently implemented. The Sioux Falls network and IEEE 69-node distribution network are coupled as the test system. According to the simulation results, when the state of health of the SLBs decreased to 70%, the conditions were unreliable. The differences in the optimal SLB size and costs considering reliability and flexibility are highlighted. A reliability-flexibility integrated optimal sizing method for second-life batteries (SLBs), comprising an upper level that determines the sizing of SLBs and a lower level that ensures optimal operation of the distribution network, is proposed. image	[Lu, Hui; Xie, Kaigui; Hu, Bo; Shao, Changzheng; Wang, Yu; Pan, Congcong] Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Power Transmiss Equipment & Syst Sec, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hui] China Elect Power Res Inst, Natl Key Lab Renewable Energy Grid Integrat, Beijing, Peoples R China		Xie, KG (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Power Transmiss Equipment & Syst Sec, Chongqing, Peoples R China.	kaiguixie@vip.163.com								0	0											OCT	2024	18	13					2177	2193		10.1049/rpg2.13052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/rpg2.13052		AUG 2024										2025-12-09

This work prioritizes bolstering DN resilience through network reconfiguration (NR), emergency repair crew (ERC) dispatch, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) response, providing topology, repair schedule, and power support. To measure the power support effect of EVs, an agent-based model (ABM) estimates EV aggregation for V2G response, considering key factors such as EV number, type, self-interested decision-making, behaviors, and traffic conditions. By integrating these parameters at macro and micro levels, agents interact with one another, including EVs, charging stations (CSs), CS aggregators, DN operators, and personalized trip advisors (PTAs). PTA navigates EVs to locate the nearest CS. Considering the interdependence of the three restoration methods, coordinated optimization is designed as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) with the IEEE 33 and PG&E 69 bus systems. The case study shows that the collaboration of these methods enhances load restoration efficiency and reduces operation costs. Sensitivity analysis on the number and type proportion of EVs and the number of ERCs offers guidance for DN operators in recovery planning.

Multiperiod Optimum Power Flow for Active Distribution Networks With Provisioning of Ancillary Services	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Distribution networks are suffering a transformation process with the insertion of distributed energy resources, changing from a passive part of the power grid into an active system. Aiming to reduce the challenges for the distribution system operators to keep the power grid operating inside of the quality levels it is possible to propose some ancillary services. Optimum Power flow is an optimization method used to plan the distribution grid operation. Additionally, the distributed energy resources can be modeled on it and ancillary services provisioning can be considered, as proposed in this work. In this way, the objective of the present work is to formulate a Multiperiod Optimum Power Flow (MPOPF) with the insertion of distributed generation, energy storage systems, microgrids, and electric vehicles at the distribution grid. This MPOPF considers the provisioning of ancillary services by the inverters associated with the equipment connected to the main grid. In the formulation, the entire grid is modeled, considering the placement of classic equipment as a voltage regulator and capacitor banks, in addition to modern technologies as DFACTS (Distribution - Flexible AC Transmission System) and four-quadrant inverters. The MPOPF was simulated for several scenarios considering a 90-bus test feeder and a real distribution grid from Curitiba - Brazil. From the results, the MPOPF proved to be highly robust, being able to simulate the grid with all the equipment connected simultaneously, performing the optimal dispatch of active and reactive power, as well as allowing the operation of ancillary services such as voltage support, peak-shaving, and demand-side management.

J	Ali, A; Shaaban, MF; Mahmoud, K				Ali, Abdelfatah; Shaaban, Mostafa F.; Mahmoud, Karar			Optimizing Hydrogen Systems and Demand Response for Enhanced Integration of RES and EVs in Smart Grids	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				Article								Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment, DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach which resulted in a notable HC increase of up to 17.24%, accompanied by a significant cost reduction. The proposed approach is also applied to define the optimal number of HS to maximize RES capacity.

The proposed model is a bi-level optimization model formulated as an upper and lower-level problem. The problem of unit commitment in the transmission network as the upper level problem with the aim of reducing operating costs and load shedding as a mixed integer linear programming model and the problem of optimal operation in the distribution network by considering renewable and non-renewable resources along with electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS), it has been considered as a linear model with the aim of reducing the cost of purchasing power from the transmission network and increasing the use of renewable energy and charging power of EVCS. According to the literature, the study gap can be seen in three key points; firstly, it is of great importance to provide a convex model that can guarantee global optimal solutions. The next point is related to the problem-solving time, according to the dimensions and number of variables and parameters in the problem of optimal coordination of the transmission and distribution network, providing a method to achieve global optimal solutions in the shortest time and the last point is related to the modeling of any number of distribution networks is integrated with the transmission network. To solve the proposed bi-level optimization problem, the method of rewriting the optimization problems using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition equations, which can model global optimal solutions as well as fast solution time and modeling a large number of distribution networks in the transmission network has been proposed. Several different networks have been considered for the validation of the proposed model and method, which proves the results obtained from the simulation of the efficiency of the proposed model and method in considering the coordinated operation of transmission and smart distribution networks. The results showed that the proposed method is about 40% faster than the decomposition method and 20% faster than the evolutionary method, and the results obtained are about 7% more optimal than the evolutionary method.

However, unplanned locations of charging stations (CSs) and station capacity determination have adverse effects on the operation and the performance of power-distribution network. In this study, we developed an optimal FCS-planning model considering the aspects of EV users' convenience, station economic benefits, the impact on distribution systems and the effect on environment. A queuing-theory-based CS sizing algorithm that benefits EV users as well as improves CS capacity utilization was proposed. The proposed planning model was verified through a case study using real road network data by employing multi-objective binary and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. In addition, to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed sizing algorithm, sensitivity analyses for different EV penetration levels and station utilization were conducted. The simulation results show that the proposed CS-allocation model is beneficial in terms of achieving the satisfaction of EV users, cost savings, better station utilization, and less impact on power grids and the environment. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed planning model, a comparative study with one of the previous work on CS planning is also performed. The results demonstrate that the proposed charging station sizing method is highly efficient in optimizing EV users' satisfaction and for better station utilization.

Most of the current EV scheduling solutions are either centralized, which suffer from low reliability and high complexity, while existing decentralized solutions do not facilitate the efficient scheduling of on-move EVs in large-scale networks considering a smart energy distribution system. Motivated by smart cities applications, we consider in this paper the optimal scheduling of EVs in a geographically large-scale smart energy distribution system where EVs have the flexibility of charging/discharging at spatially-deployed smart charging stations (CSs) operated by individual aggregators. In such a scenario, we define the social welfare maximization problem as the total profit of both supply and demand sides in the form of a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. Due to the intractability, we then propose an online decentralized algorithm with low complexity which utilizes effective heuristics to forward each EV to the most profitable CS in a smart manner. Results of simulations on the IEEE 37 bus distribution network verify that the proposed algorithm improves the social welfare by about 30% on average with respect to an alternative scheduling strategy under the equal participation of EVs in charging and discharging operations. Considering the best-case performance where only EV profit maximization is concerned, our solution also achieves upto 20% improvement in flatting the final electricity load. Furthermore, the results reveal the existence of an optimal number of CSs and an optimal vehicle-to-grid penetration threshold for which the overall profit can be maximized. Our findings serve as guidelines for V2G system designers in smart city scenarios to plan a cost-effective strategy for large-scale EVs distributed energy management.

The proposed model can calculate the energy that a vehicle within a depot can deliver back to the grid during periods of peak energy demand, based on the operational schedule that must be guaranteed (number of buses in service). After a presentation of the main features of V2G and the main benefits this technology can bring to the transportation company, the model structure, and related algorithms, as well as input and output data, are presented and discussed. To verify the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model, a case study related to the company that manages public transportation in the city of Milan, Italy, is described. 2 depots were analyzed considering the energy load during peak hours and the energy that could be injected into the grid considering the vehicles parked in the depot. From a quantitative point of view, V2G could feed about 7 MW to 10 MW into the grid, depending on the day of the week and time of day. Considering an average connection of 3 kW for a household, between 2,300 and 3,300 households could be served. In addition, an economic evaluation was performed considering energy trading: monthly, total revenues are 45,922 (sic) and total costs are 42,848 (sic); the economic benefit can be estimated at about 6.7% of total monthly revenues.

J	Alam, MS; Arefifar, SA				Alam, Md Shahin; Arefifar, Seyed Ali			Hybrid PSO-TS Based Distribution System Expansion Planning for System Performance Improvement Considering Energy Management	IEEE ACCESS				Article								Energy management (EM) has become very attractive in smart grid era for both industry and academia. EM in a power distribution system (PDS) can reduce the system losses, operational costs and emissions, and increases system's reliability, voltage stability and efficiency. This article expands the PDS using different distributed energy resources (DERs) and observes their impacts on EM success, operational costs, system losses, and emissions. Moreover, the impacts of integrating reactive sources (RSs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and electric vehicles (EVs) on the system's operational performance is investigated. An index is defined to measure the energy management success rate (EMSR) and several case studies are created for investigating variety of system expansion options individually and collectively. Furthermore, a new reliability index, namely reliability index success rate (RISR), is defined and sensitivity analysis are presented to investigate the DERs impacts on system's voltage controllability and the defined reliability index. A new hybrid PSO-TS optimization algorithm is developed, and the well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution network is selected for the simulations. Several case studies presented in the paper provide a clear understanding of the impacts of integrating different resources on the EM as well as other operational aspects of a PDS. The results reveal that the system expansion using DERs with different capacities along with EM strategies could have significant impacts on PDS performance depending on the DERs types' and capacities. Due to their availability and low operational costs, gas turbine further improves the performance indices comparing to the renewables that have uncertain availability and to diesel generators with their high operational costs.

A novel method for eliminating the exponential growth of computing optimal demand response events for large-scale appliances re-scheduling	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS & NETWORKS				Article								The electric grid is undertaking a change of paradigm. New requirements such as the high power loads of Electric Vehicles' charging are putting pressure on grids, and the popularisation of the figure of the prosumers, are creating new needs on the management of the system. Although the investment on infrastructure is one of the ways of alleviating the arrival of this new loads, the existence of smart controls, actuators and smart appliances opens also the door for demand modification. The so called Demand Response Events are strategies to reallocate the loads of the consumers, so the power demand is shifted towards times less critical for the grid. Some smart appliances can be considered as shiftable. The operation of them can be rescheduled to other times and still provide their services. On this paper we suggest an optimisation methodology consisting on a parallelisation method together with a generic algorithm that would allow an overlooking controller (such as aggregator or DSO) reduce the power peaks even with a large number of devices to control. The research here presented has looked for the smallest group size at which the optimisation is more effectible done in parallel groups rather than on a single large set. With this, we eliminated the exponential growth of the computational effort that the optimisation algorithm would need to do organising all devices in one go. The method achieves a computational time reduction of 80%, and it is only worsening the reduction of peak by 2.8% compared to an optimisation with a complete set. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

J	Han, Q; Li, XP; He, LC				Han, Qi; Li, Xueping; He, Liangce			A hierarchical deep reinforcement learning method for coupled transportation and power distribution system dispatching	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE				Article								The randomness and dimensionality growth of variables in the Coupled transportation and power distribution systems (CTPS) pose challenges for effectively solving CTPS dispatching tasks. This paper presents a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) method, which disperses the action and state space of CTPS onto decision- making layer and autonomous optimization layer. The Cloud DRL model in the decision-making layer is responsible for the load assignment task of charging stations. The distribution network (DN) and transportation network (TN) DRL models in the autonomous optimization layer are responsible for optimizing the DN and TN respectively. A layer-wise training method is adopted to alleviate the asynchronous convergence problem of HDRL. Firstly, the Gurobi assists in achieving the efficient training of Cloud DRL model by ensuring the reward effectiveness of autonomous optimization layers. Meanwhile, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm assists in optimizing the diversity and focalization of the Transitions by controlling distribution patterns of species initialization, during the pre-sampling and training stage. Then, the trained Cloud DRL model is frozen to train the DN and TN DRL models. This method is tested on two different sizes of CTPS. Simulation analysis shows that this method improves the training performance of the HDRL model.

For this aim, we first develop an empirical operating model considering operating characteristics of the distribution system with the BSS explicitly. Then, on this basis, a rolling optimization scheduling model of the distribution network is established. In particular, a refined BSS model including a new calculation method of available generation capacity (AGC) is included. Finally, a quantitative method to quantify the effect of BSS on reliability and economy of distribution networks is proposed. Compared with existing works, the main contribution of this paper is threefold. (i) A battery-level BSS operational model including AGC calculation is proposed to fully explore the V2G potential of the BSS. (ii) A rolling optimization scheduling model is established, which fully exploits the potential interaction between economy and reliability of system operation. (iii) An assessment framework is proposed to analyze the special value of BSS resources from aspects of both economy improvement and reliability enhancement, which can provide more practical instruction for BSS planning. Numerical studies are conducted based on IEEE 33-bus distribution network to verify the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. The simulation results show that if V2G of the BSS is orderly exploited and managed, the net profit of the distribution system will increase by 11.97%, and system expected energy not supplied (SEENS) will decrease by 14.34%. The reliability and economy are two contradictory factors, the dispatch model we proposed can achieve better economy with the same reliability level. The location of the BSS also has important effect of the economy and reliability of distribution system. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Due to this, many resources and customers are involved in optimization, making ERM a complex problem. Moreover, when the inherent uncertainty of weather conditions, load forecast, electric vehicles planned trips, or market prices is considered, deterministic approaches might fail in obtaining optimal solutions to the problem. In this context, evolutionary algorithms are a useful tool to find effective near-optimal solutions. In fact, to design and test evolutionary algorithms to solve the ERM problem under uncertainty, the research community has developed a simulation framework. In this paper, we propose the Cellular Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with Normal-Cauchy distribution (CUMDANCauchy) to address the ERM problem in uncertain environments. CUMDANCauchy uses a univariate estimation of the product of Normal and Cauchy distributions over each feature, and produces new individuals not only by the sampling of the learned distributions but also using neighborhoods of individuals from a ring cellular structure. The experiments performed over two case studies show that: CUMDANCauchy is as competitive as the previous dominant class of algorithms in terms of the global fitness achieved; its convergence behavior is among the best in comparison with the other tested algorithms; its running time is similar to the algorithm with the best global fitness achieved in the first case study, and it is the fastest algorithm in the second one.

Optimization Approaches for Fast Charging Stations Allocation and Sizing: A Review	IEEE ACCESS				Article								The widespread use of fossil fuels in transportation has resulted in significant carbon dioxide emissions and increased reliance on non-renewable energy sources. To address these environmental challenges, the electrification of transportation systems through Electric Vehicles (EVs) has emerged as a promising solution. However, the successful deployment of EVs hinges on the availability of a robust charging infrastructure capable of meeting the charging demands and extending the driving range of EVs. Nonetheless, the large-scale deployment of EV charging infrastructure presents several challenges, including the ability of the electric grid to supply the required energy to accommodate the charging demand. Moreover, determining the optimal locations for fast-charging stations (FCS) in the traffic network to ensure accessibility, convenience, and efficient resource utilization poses a significant challenge. As a result, numerous studies have investigated the optimal allocation and sizing of EV charging infrastructure. The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive literature review to examine how this optimization problem has been addressed in the literature over the past decade. The review aims to identify the key factors considered in the problem formulation and the optimization techniques for allocating and sizing the charging stations. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA methodology for a comprehensive and unbiased approach. This review contributes to the existing literature by highlighting critical gaps and proposing a framework that can possibly bridge these gaps. The review identifies several critical gaps in current research, including: 1) Transportation-focused studies largely ignore electrical grid constraints; 2) Electrical-focused research often relies on statistically modeled EV charging demand, which may include some geographical assumptions; 3) Multidisciplinary approaches integrating both transportation and electrical networks are still in early stage; 4) Dynamic traffic flow of EVs is rarely considered; 5) Exact optimization methods largely rely on linearized or approximated models; 6) Dominance of approximate methods in transportation and electrical network modeling, primarily relying on evolutionary algorithms; and 7) Hybrid approaches are mainly utilized to solve a specific part of the problem rather than enhancing the quality of the solution. In response to these gaps, the research proposes a novel framework to integrate the transportation network and the electrical grid planning process, offering a holistic and practical solution in FCS infrastructure development.

Hadi			Probabilistic-possibilistic model for a parking lot in the smart distribution network expansion planning	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				Article								Conventional distribution network departs to the smart grid. The parking lot will have an important role in the smart grid as a distributed generation. Due to the output power of parking lots is uncertain, More accurate modeling of parking lot output power is necessary for the future of distribution network studies such as Distribution Network Expansion Planning (DNEP). In this paper, a systematic method based on the Z-number concept is utilized to represent the uncertainty of Vehicle to Grid's (V2G's) presence. In order to investigate the impact of V2Gs uncertainty on the DNEP, we proposed a Probabilistic-Possibilistic DNEP in the presence of V2Gs referred to as P-PDNEPV2G. If the V2Gs historical data is incomplete, the proposed structure can significantly consider the effects of V2G on the DNEP. In P-PDNEPV2G, parking lots output power is described as a probabilistic-possibilistic variable by Z-number method. The optimization of P-PDNEPV2G is executed by the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). A 24-bus test system and the real 20 kV distribution network of Ghale-Ganj city of Kerman province in Iran are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

The study suggests a possible linear correlation between the distributions of the EC's aggregated PV generation and energy surplus sales, which could help DSOs estimate grid contributions based on solar production characteristics. Additionally, it characterizes EC behavior in terms of demand and energy trading, identifying hours with a higher likelihood of flexibility provision and estimating the potential quantity of such services. To generate the data, two optimization models were developed to simulate EC operations, focusing on peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and evaluating the EC's capability to provide flexibility as a service to the DSO. The models employ a second-order cone programming formulation incorporating distribution network (DN) constraints and considering different DERs, including rooftop solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and heat pumps. Simulations were performed over a one-year horizon with hourly resolution using a modified single-phase version of the IEEE European Low Voltage test feeder, ensuring sufficient annual data for statistical analysis. As a result, the identified statistical patterns could assist the DSO in planning operations based only on aggregated community data, avoiding the need to model individual user decisions and ensuring data privacy.

J	Ye, R; Huang, XL; Yang, ZX				Ye, Rui; Huang, Xueliang; Yang, Zexin			Energy Management Method for Fast-Charging Stations with the Energy Storage System to Alleviate the Voltage Problem of the Observation Node	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								Large-scale fast charging of electric vehicles (EVs) probably causes voltage deviation problems in the distribution network. Installing energy storage systems (ESSs) in the fast-charging stations (FCSs) and formulating appropriate active power plans for ESSs is an effective way to reduce the local voltage deviation problem. Some deterministic centralized strategies used for ESSs at FCSs are proposed to solve the voltage deviation problem mentioned above. However, the randomness of the EV load is very large, which can probably reduce the effects of deterministic centralized strategies. A fast and reliable centralized strategy considering the randomness of the EV load for ESSs is a key requirement. Therefore, we propose in this paper a day-ahead scheduling strategy with the aim of maximizing the probability of the nodal voltage change being smaller than a preset limit at the observation node. In the proposed strategy, the uncertainty of EV load is taken into account and the probability of the voltage change of an observation node is quantified by a proposed analytic assessment model (AMM). Furthermore, a voltage change optimization model (VCOM) based on a novel control parameter b is proposed, where b can be used as a constraint to suppress the nodal voltage change at the observation node. Finally, the IEEE 33-bus test system is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed day-ahead ESS strategy.

J	Adnan, M; Ghadi, Y; Ahmed, I; Ali, M				Adnan, Muhammad; Ghadi, Yazeed; Ahmed, Ijaz; Ali, Mansoor			Transmission Network Planning in Super Smart Grids: A Survey	IEEE ACCESS				Article								For a utility company to reduce CO2 emissions along with managing load demands, it must strive for a 100 percent renewable electrical power generation. Europe takes initiatives to achieve this goal by developing a super smart grid (SSG) based on renewable energy resources (RERs) by 2050. The SSG is based on two exclusive alternatives: wide area and decentralized power generation using large number of RERs. Before developing such SSG, there is a need to address the critical issues associated with RERs, i.e., load flow balancing and transients stability. Considering a reliability issue involved with RERs and the random deviations between demand response and generation response patterns, load flow balancing and transient stability become challenging research issues in SSGs. These technical issues are also considered to be more challenging, if an unexpected outage in the form of an occurrence of three phase (L-L-L) faults (TPF) arises in SSGs, due to power quality disturbances. To address this problem, load flow balancing probabilistic modeling is performed in this research paper in order to formulate the complexity of randomness between generation and demand response patterns through transmission network planning (TNP) in the form of a super smart node (SSN) transmission network infrastructure. Moreover, a further optimization in SSN transmission network has been done with the addition of a cooperative control strategies in terms of an integrating vehicle to grid (V2G) technology in SSN transmission network in order to achieve further enhancement in load flow balancing and transient stability in SSGs. Furthermore, as SSGs power infrastructure is based on different clusters, therefore in order to accommodate various clusters for load flow balancing, a continuous spinning reserve (CSRs) probabilistic modeling has also been performed in this paper in terms of its integration in SSN transmission network. Considering above probabilistic analysis, future contingencies are easily predictable, before any kind of disruptive changes arises in a SSGs due an occurrence of a TPF. Moreover, from simulation results as performed in this paper, we can easily verified that our proposed probabilistic algorithm of load flow balancing and transients stability outperforms existing literature work and can also achieved near optimal performance, even for a broad range of variations in load and also in case of an arising of significant power quality disturbances in SSGs due to an occurrence of TPF.

J	Tushar, MHK; Assi, C				Tushar, Mosaddek Hossain Kamal; Assi, Chadi			Volt-VAR Control Through Joint Optimization of Capacitor Bank Switching, Renewable Energy, and Home Appliances	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				Article								Today, the evolution of smart grid, electric vehicles (EVs) with voltage to the grid mode, and deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) are bringing revolutionary changes to the existing electrical grid. Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) is a well-studied problem, for bringing solutions to reduce the losses and demand along the distribution lines. The current VVO, however, does not acknowledge the role of elastic and inelastic loads, EVs, and RESs to reduce the reactive power losses and hence the cost of generation. We propose a mathematical model Volt-VAR and CVR optimization (VVCO)/optimal energy consumption model (OECM) to solve the VVO problem by considering load shifting, EV as the storage and carrier of the energy, and use of RES. The VVCO/OECM not only reduces the reactive load but also flatten the load curve to reduce the uncertainty in the generation and to decrease the cost. The system also considers the efficiency of the electrical equipment to enhance the lifetime of the devices. We develop a non-cooperative game to solve the VVCO/OECM problem. To evaluate the performance, we simulate the VVCO/OECM model and compare with the existing VVO solution. We found that our method took almost a constant time to produce a solution of VVO regardless of the size of the network. The proposed method also outperform the existing VVO solution by reducing the generation cost and flatten the load and minimizes the uncertainty in the power generation. Results have shown that exploiting RES will reduce the voltage drop through reducing the injection of reactive power to the system.

In the current HTN, fuel vehicles (FVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) form a mixed traffic flow together. In this context, a novel model is proposed for the planning of energy facilities in HTN, including the construction of charging stations and the retirement of gas stations, which takes into account not only the balance of traffic flow but also environmental factors in the planning process. Meanwhile, the construction of charging stations leads to the coupling of HTN and distribution network (DN). In order to further achieve the goal of carbon reduction, a planning framework of low carbon facilities in the charging system is proposed, including the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems.

This strategy is based on a bilevel method, where it maximizes the expected VPP revenue in the proposed markets subject to constraints of renewable and flexible sources and the VPP reserve model in the upper-level problem. Also, a market-clearing model based on network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) is explained in the lower-level problem so that it minimizes the expected operating cost of generation units constrained to a linearized AC-NCUC model. The scenario-based stochastic programming (SBSP) models the uncertainties of loads and WF power generation. Then, the master/slave decomposition method solves the bilevel problem to achieve an optimal solution at a low computational time. Also, since the lower-level problem is mixed-integer linear programming, the Benders decomposition algorithm is adopted to solve this problem. Finally, the suggested approach is implemented on IEEE test networks in GAMS software, and numerical results confirm the efficiency of the coordinated VPP management in DA energy and reserve markets and its capabilities in improving network operation.

By integrating a microscopic urban transportation network (MUTN) with a power distribution network (PDN), V2Sim enables precise modeling of electric vehicle charging loads (EVCL) and dynamic V2G operations. The platform uniquely combines SUMO for MUTN simulations and an optimized DistFlow model for PDN analysis, with dedicated models for fast charging stations (FCS) and slow charging stations (SCS), capturing detailed charging dynamics often overlooked in existing simulation tools. V2Sim supports a range of customizable V2G strategies, advanced fault-sensing in charging stations, and parallel simulation through multi-processing to accelerate large-scale case studies. Case studies using a real-world MUTN from Nanjing, China, demonstrate V2Sim's capability to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of EVCL and evaluate V2G impacts, such as fault dissemination and pricing variations, in unprecedented detail. Unlike traditional equilibrium models, V2Sim captures single-vehicle behavior and charging interactions at the microscopic level, offering unparalleled accuracy in assessing the operational and planning needs of V2G-compatible systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers and urban planners aiming to optimize integrated power and transportation networks.

Smart grid techniques are required to reconfigure and compensate for load fluctuation and stabilize power losses and voltage fluctuation. Numerical tools are available to equip the smart grid to deal with such challenges. Distribution Feeder reconfiguration and reactive voltage injection to the disturbed grid are some of the techniques employed for the purpose. However, either reconfiguration or injection alone is used commonly for this purpose. In this study, both techniques are applied to EV penetration as load and compared. A balanced IEEE 33 Radial network is used in this study and selected branches with high power losses are targeted for the reactive voltage injection and Minimum Spanning tree techniques (MST). EV charging loads are usually modelled with time base distribution which requires times base power flow analysis for reactive power injection. A comparison between coordinated, reconfiguration, and reactive voltage injection shows differences in power losses, voltage distortion, and cost saving. The analysis is carried out with an integer linear programming technique for coordinated charging, a minimum spanning tree for network reconfiguration, and genetic optimization for reactive power injection. Besides, all power flow analyses are carried out with the Backward/Forward sweep method. The information would help lowering power losses, grid stabilization, and charging station infrastructure planning.

Hence, this paper presents the probabilistic planning of distributed generations (DGs) and switched capacitive bank (SCB) constrained to the securable-reliable operation (SRO) strategy in reconfigurable SDN. The scheme is formulated as a four-objective optimization problem to simultaneously model the economic, operation, reliability, and security indices of SDN. So that the first to fourth objective minimize the total planning cost and expected operation cost, voltage deviation function (VDF), expected energy not-supplied (EENS), and voltage security index (VSI). It is limited to the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equations, planning and operation model of DG and SCB, formulation of demand response program (DRP), SDN reconfiguration constraints, reliability and voltage security limits. Then, the single-objective model is obtained by using the epsilon constraint-based Pareto optimization technique. Additionally, the non-parametric probabilistic method models uncertainties of load, energy price, renewable DGs (RDGs) power, and network equipment availability. The strategy is as mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), where hybrid Krill Herd Optimization (KHO) and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) achieves a reliable optimal solution. The following provides the planning of different sources based on the SRO strategy with simultaneous formulation of various economic and technical indices considering non-parametric modeling of uncertainties and solving the problem using the mentioned hybrid algorithm presented the contribution in this paper. By implementing this scheme on a 69-bus SDN, the numerical results confirm capability of this scheme in improving the economic, operation, reliability, and security situation of SDN compared to power flow studies. Where it can enhance the mentioned indices up to 16%, 36%, 99%, and 9% taking into account optimal planning and operation of different sources and the DRP compared to the corresponding values obtained by power flow studies.

This paper presents a fast distributed algorithm for aggregating a large number of households with a mixture of discrete and continuous energy levels. A distinctive feature of the method in this paper is that the non-convex demand response (DR) problem is decomposed in terms of households as opposed to devices, which allows incorporating more intricate couplings between energy storage devices, appliances, and distributed energy resources. The proposed method is a fast distributed algorithm applied to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted DR model. The method is tested on systems with up to 2560 households, each with 10 devices on average. The proposed algorithm is designed to terminate in 60 iterations irrespective of system size, which can be ideal for an on-line version of this problem. Moreover, numerical results show that with minimal parameter tuning, the algorithm exhibits a very similar convergence behavior throughout the studied systems and converges to near-optimal solutions, which corroborates its scalability.

The primary motivation is to find the optimal sizing and siting of NWAs while considering WAs such that the ADN's dynamically growing electrical load and EV demand are met while maintaining network limits. Given the flexibility of NWA resources, they can provide the support needed to the ADN (e.g., congestion relief and voltage support) while providing ASs to the grid. The proposed model is posed as a mixed-integer linear program to maximize the overall profits of the DSO. WAs considered include adding/upgrading lines and upgrading the substation by installing transformers, while NWAs include sizing and siting of distributed RESs, TGs, and BESSs with considering EVCSs supply the EVs. Simulation results demonstrate the financial benefits of simultaneously considering WAs and NWAs. They also verify the feasibility of having the DSO participate in the ASs market utilizing its flexible resources. To further assess the proposed model characteristics, additional cases and sensitivity analyses are conducted.

Optimal allocation of EV charging spots and capacitors in distribution network improving voltage and power loss by Quantum-Behaved and Gaussian Mutational Dragonfly Algorithm (QGDA)	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				Article								In this paper, a new methodology for optimal planning of charging stations (CS) along with capacitors (CAP) using proposed technique is presented. In order to achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation for dragonfly algorithm (DA), the quantum-behaved and Gaussian mutation strategies on the performance of DA is used. This is the novelty of our proposed work. Hence, it is named as quantum-behaved Gaussian mutational DA (QGDA). Here, parking lot and capacitor allocation is suggested for congestion management along with reactive power compensation. In order to optimally determine the parking lot size, QGDA is utilized. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is tested on adapted IEEE 34-bus distribution network. The result attained by QGDA technique is compared with existing techniques such as PSO and BBO. With PL, the proposed technique achieves the P-loss and Q(loss) of 25.61 kW and 25.99KVar. PL and C at same node, the proposed technique achieves the P-loss and Q(loss) of 31.09 kW and 32.88KVar. PL and C at different node, the proposed technique achieves the P-loss and Q(loss) of 25.09 kW and 26.98KVar. Furthermore, the proposed results show that an uneven EV charging scenario can cause significant voltage unbalance that goes beyond its allowed limit of 2%.

Optimal EV Charging and PV Siting in Prosumers towards Loss Reduction and Voltage Profile Improvement in Distribution Networks	WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL				Article								In this paper, the problem of simultaneous charging of Electrical Vehicles (EVs) in distribution networks (DNs) is examined in order to depict congestion issues, increased power losses, and voltage constraint violations. To this end, this paper proposes an optimal EV charging schedule in order to allocate the charging of EVs in non-overlapping time slots, aiming to avoid overloading conditions that could stress the DN operation. The problem is structured as a linear optimization problem in GAMS, and the linear Distflow is utilized for the power flow analysis required. The proposed approach is compared to the one where EV charging is not optimally scheduled and each EV is expected to start charging upon its arrival at the residential charging spot. Moreover, the analysis is extended to examine the optimal siting of small-sized residential Photovoltaic (PV) systems in order to provide further relief to the DN. A mixed-integer quadratic optimization model was formed to integrate the PV siting into the optimization problem as an additional optimization variable and is compared to a heuristic-based approach for determining the sites for PV installation. The proposed methodology has been applied in a typical low-voltage (LV) DN as a case study, including real power demand data for the residences and technical characteristics for the EVs. The results indicate that both the DN power losses and the voltage profile are further improved in regard to the heuristic-based approach, and the simultaneously scheduled penetration of EVs and PVs could yield up to a 66.3% power loss reduction.
